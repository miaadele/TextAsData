By Edward Topsell. Topsell, Edward, 1572-1625? THE FIRST EPISTLE OF DOCT. CONRADVS GESNERVS before his History of Foure-footed-Beastes, concer∣ning the vtility of this STORY. A LL PHILOSOPHY (most worthy accomplished men,) is in euery part excellent good, most beautifull, and most wor∣thy of the loue and honor of all mortall men, which are her Clyents and Loue s, (as all wise and excellent men haue iud∣ged) in euery age. But because the wits of men do differ, as education, conuersation, custome, and the profit of life and liuing, and peraduenture many other causes, do make many varieties of opinions in vs, which do possesse humaine minds; with very many preiudices, not onely in learning and religi∣on, but almost in euery thing; from hence therfore it com∣meth to passe, that some do follow one part of learning which they altogether propoun∣ded to themselues, or for the occasion, and profit of the present estate of their affaires. So is it with me, that I euen from a child, being brought vp of a kins-man (practitioner of Physicke) haue tasted from my youth the loue of that profession: And although I had a little conceiued the knowledge of diuers things in the encrease of my age, yet I left off the study of physicke, (more then was meete,) because I would not continue ouer long therein; yet afterwards I returned again vnto the former study thereof, the care of house∣hould affaires requiring the same at my handes. But when I considered the greate affini∣ty of this Science with naturall Phylosophy, and that not any one can be accounted an excellent or learned Physitian, which hath not drawne (as it were from a Fountaine) his first instruction from bookes of nature; I diligently began to peruse the writings of Phi∣losophers, which haue disputed or debated of things pertaining to nature: In which those things did chiefely delight me, which did handle or intreat concerning mettals, plantes, and liuing creatures, and that for two causes. First of all, because there may bee had of those things a more true & certain knowledge then of vnperfect or mixed bodies or Mete∣ours, and certaine other things, too learned or curious or far remoued from sence, or such like, that a man can neuer hope for any sufficient knowledge of them, by any reason or sence. Afterwardes because their knowledge and contemplation did not onely pertaine to phisick, but also to minister and to gouerne euery thing peculiar, as other arts which were much more profitable and necessary. Therefore I spent much time in this study, so that in spared or borrowed houres, and as often as I did desire to recreate my selfe from other studies or businesses, I very desi∣rously turned to them many yeares, accepting them for my onely pleasures and ioyes, which houres the common sort of men, and euen very many learned men, do idlely a∣buse in walking, playing, and drinking. And although I haue considered and obserued very many thinges concerning Plants, and other things, not seene and considered before me, or at least-wise brought to light of no man before, therefore it would seeme lesse necessary at this present to write of them, seeing that many do euen to this day write learnedly and profitably concerning plants; Geor: Agricola, a man worthy of great praise, hath most learnedly and profitably written concerning mettals: wherefore I applyed my mind to the History of foure-foo∣ted-beastes handled lightly in our age, and onely in partes. But when that I saw I should profit but little, except I should adioyn the Histories of those that haue trauailed in other countries, to these priuate studies, and gathering of our owne. I went first of all to some points of the Germans, (but not many) and by and by after, I did adde thereunto mine owne trauailes into Italy, not onely for this cause, but for the honor of my Bybliothaeca, that I might reckon vp all kind of writers therein for the further honor thereof: But if I had met with any Mecoenas, or had had further ability, or my fortunes greater, I had tra∣uailed further, both by Sea and land, into far remote places, for the enlarging of the sto∣ry both of beasts and plants, for the benefit of all posterity, although I am in my selfe a ve∣ry weake and sickly man. But because that was not lawful, by reason I wanted sufficient meanes, I haue done that which I could, and haue got also some friendes vnto me out of diuers regions or parts of Europe, with whom after I communicated my purposes, they returned vnto me sundry discriptions of strange beasts, and the moderne names of vul∣gar beasts in many languages, with their pictures and the true formes. In the meane time I did not only sit still and turne ouer books, but gaue my selfe diligently to enquire of eue∣ry Country-man or trauailer, a perticular and exact obseruation of the nature of euery beast: and for this cause I conferred with strangers of other nations, which by any occa∣sion either were resident among vs, or passed accidentally through our country, & made of their relation the most diligent notes that I could gather, conferring them with olde writers, and comparing one with another, till I had digested the perfection of my inten∣ted story, and the method thereof for the drawing of it into a perfect body. And thus by little and little the worke or volume increased, not only by my great tra∣uaile and paines, but also to my great cost and charge, considering my poore and needy estate: when I thought that it was growne great enough (for if all things grow infinite and endlesse) then I disposed it to be printed and published to the world, least that by defering the diuulgation thereof vnder colour to learne moe thinges, that might happen to mee, which befalleth all men (namely Death) and so I should by my owne modesty or backe∣wardnesse, not onely ouerthrow my owne labours, but also depriue well deseruing men, of the vniuersall benifit to be reaped by this story. Then I determined first of all to begin with the story of foure-footed-beasts, such as are not generated in parts and vnperfectly as it were in an Egge, but perfectly and totally together in the dams belly, because they were not onely the most worthy, principall, and excellent, among all the creatures of this World next vnto men, but also, because their naturall parts of body and disposition, do most of all resemble mankind. And of the residue, namely, such as are conceiued out of Egges, either foure-footed, or Birds, or Fishes, or Serpents, or reptiles, (if God permit) we will entreat perticularly in another Tome by itselfe. And thus much for the order, in∣crease, occasion, and edition of this worke. The first be∣nifit of this story to phy∣sicke. But some man will inquire the cause and reason of so great a labor and study, and de∣maund of me what fruites, profit, and benefit, can come by this History? To whom I make this answere: First, the knowledge of this naturall part of Phylosophye, is very ne∣cessary and profitable to Physicke, and that many waies; First, for that many beastes are vsed for meate, nourishment, and medicine, and for that cause are not only applied out∣wardly, but inwardly to the body of man: & then more particularly, because about four-footed-beasts which breed in their own kind, for because of the similitude they carry with mankind in body and affections, they suffer many diseases in common with vs, which are cured by euery heard-man and leach in the fields: and also the beasts themselues do offer many profitable medicines for the cure of men; which the skilful Phisitian must borrow from them, if he wil be perfect in his art, and conscionable in his profession. But if that a man bee wounded or poysoned by serpentes, Lyzards, creeping creatures, or by the bi∣tings of any foure-footed-beast in his madnesse, or by fishes, or by eating them in meat, wherein the Phisitians skill is required, to shew the cause and cure of such a wounde, where shall he find better direction, then to be informed of the particular venom that ly∣eth hid in euery beast by nature, which thing we haue endeuored to explaine in this our Treatise. Moreouer there are many necessary obseruations about meate, drinke, sleepe, watching, quietnesse, and perturbation of affections in men, and other naturall motions whereby health is to be preserued, the perfectest rules and examples thereof are to bee drawen from bruit beasts, vnto the vse of men. And I haue proued by the inspection into this knowledge, that herein is layed the lar∣gest foundation of Medicine, either by drawing it from those things which do naturally flow and fall from the beasts, or that which they suffer and endure, or else from those things which they haue obserued to be in them; for it more safe and without impiety, to make tryall of a new Medicine vpon a beast, rather then vpon a man. And lastly, seeing diuers Medicines arise out of euery part of euery beast almost, all which we haue recited in one place Methodically together, and part after part, heereby the Physitian shall reape this commodity, that when he hath any beast in his hand, by looking into this worke he shall find what part he ought to reserue for medicine, and also to what sicknesse it is to be ap∣plied. And after the same maner may euery man chuse his meat, and know by this treatise what is most, and what is least nourishable, and agreeable to the nature of man. And if it pleased me to rehearseal that commeth into this catalogue about vtility of beasts, I would shew you how many arts and occupations of men, do raise maintenance and sustentation from beasts, both to sell them for mony, and also to take them for meate: as the Fisher∣men which follow the waters, taking for food such fishes as by the ordinance of God, are ordained for that purpose. They which are Grasyers and keepe cattell of all sorts, liue vpon their changing, fat∣ting, feeding, and selling. Those which make Butter and Cheese, whereof there are many in the Mountaines of Heluctia, liue only vpon that labour, and therefore the know∣ledge of Kye, Oxen, Asses, Elkes, Reyners, Camels, and diuers other beastes, is most ne∣cessary for these men, from whom they draw Milke, and therefore good to maintaine and preserue their health. There be some Horse-leaches, Cowe-leaches, Oxe-leaches, and such like for this purpose. There be that liue only vpon the Marchandizes of their skins, as Tawyers, Glouers, Curriers, Shoomakers, and Breast plate-makers of Leathers, Sadlers, Leather-sellers, Purse-makers, and such like. Some againe haue an Art to dresse the skins with their haire and wooll vpon them, for garments. Some liue by keambing, shearing, spinning, clothing, and making sundry ne∣cessaries out of wooll, Goats haire, and Camels haire. For the vse of the cattell aliue, I might be endlesse to shew all, first the husbandmen vse Oxen and Asses, the vse of Hor∣ses and Mules, both for trauaile and plowing, and carriage. The Art of riding commen∣dable for all sorts of men, both in peace and warre, not onely for great Princes and Mo∣narches, but for euery Cittizen: many things are vsed for buildings which canot be drawn or brought together, but by Oxen, Horsses, Mules, Asses, Camels, Elephants, Reyners, Elkes, and such like. Who knoweth not the vse of Dogges, for they keepe Houses, and cattell, and they attend, guard, and defend men: they hunt wilde beasts, they driue them away, or kill, or retaine them to the hand of man, that he may be conqueror of them. In fine, the knowledge of beasts is profitable to many arts, sciences, and occupations, which may be better perceiued, by the particular practize and application of him that is studi∣ous thereof, then by any other meanes. But in the worke it selfe, it shalbe manifested what vse and commodity ariseth out of euery beast, what remedies, or Medicines, what for garmentes, what for meate, what for carriage, what for prognostication of euill weather, what for pleasure and pastimes; so as we shall not need to prosecute these parts in this present Epistle. Also there want not instructions out of beasts, by imitation of whose examples, the liues and manners of men are to be framed to another and a better practise, which thing is ma∣nifested by learned and wise men, but especially by Theodorus Gaza, who discourseth ther∣of in his Praeface vpon the bookes of Aristotle, of the partes of creatures; whose wordes we will recite in the Epistle to our Reader. But if I should shew at large and copiously, how many things may be collected out of the knowledge of beasts for familiar and houshold affaires, I might be infinite: but seeing I haue already shewed how necessary they bee for husbandry, for meat, for carriage, and such like, it must be vnderstood that all those commodities belong to this part of Occo∣nominall profit. The like I may say of the pleasure in their contemplation; for although all their vtilities cannot be knowne, and in many thinges they are not beneficiall to men, yet if a man be skilful and haue any vnderstanding, he shal be much delighted by looking into the natures of beasts, by consideration of the many and infinite differences among them, whether he respect their body, or their minds, or their actions: for what is more wonderfull then the voice or extemporall song of many Birdes, who although they be far distant and remote from vs, and will not abide our presence for natural fear of death, yet is not the eleborate deuise of musicall and artificiall numbers, measures, and voyces of men comparable vnto them. Pliny that Star and ornament of his time, spendeth a great deale of labour in the ad∣miration of the Nightingale. And what man withall his witte, can sufficiently declare and proclaime the wonderful industrious minds of the little Emmets and Bees, moued almost with no bodies, being silly things, and yet indued with noble and commendable qualities, in deformed members; so that I might conclude, that there is not any beast which hath not onely somthing in it which is rare, glorious, and peculiar to himselfe, but also some∣thing that is deuine. Wherefore I may seeme a foole, to handle these things in a Praeface which are copi∣ously discoursed in the whole worke. Aristotle maketh it a true property of a Noble, libe∣rall, and well gouerned mind, to be more delighted with the rare, plesant, and admirable qualities of a beast, then with the lucre and gaine that commeth thereby. For it is a token of a filthy, beastly, illiberall, and wretched mind, to loue no more then we can reape commodity by. There be very many things which do not yeald any profit to the possessors or owners, but only please them, & allure their minds by outward form and beauty, so do the most pretious stones, as Adamants, Topazyes, Iacynthes, Smaradgs Chrysolytes, and many such other thinges; by the wearing whereof, no man is deliue∣red either from sicknesse or perill (although some superstitious persons put confidence in them for such vertues) but haue crept into the fauour and treasures of men, onely be∣cause like earthly stars they shine and glitter in the eies of men, resembling the resplendant glory and light of heauenly bodies, and other vse they haue none: and in the meane time, he that should prefer free-stones fitted and squared for buildings, or else Whet-stones, or Mil-stones, and such like, which are most necessary for priuate vse and commodity, yet doe they seeme vile in comparison of others; and that should prefer all of them before one of the other, he should be acounted no wiser then Aesops Cocke: and if he should but equall them in price and estimation in like sort, he should be iudged an egregious blocke or foole; and yet the best of these are without life, without spirit, immoueable, and vnwor∣thy. For this cause there is none of the creatures but deserue, a far more admiration and esteeme; and among liuing creatures, all those which containe noble spirits in base and vile bodies, without apt Organs and instrumentes for the better mouing of their bodies: For as in clocks we admire the lesser more then the greater, so ought we to admire the les∣ser narrow bodies indued with such industrious spirits, more then the greater, broader, and larger beasts: for all workemen do shew more art, skill, and cunning in the small and little price of worke, then the greater. Solinus writeth, that Alexander the great had Homers Illiads writen in Parchment, so close together, that it might be contained in a Nut-shell. The like admiration was there of the exile and curious small works of Myrmicidas the Milesian, and Callicrates the Lacedemo∣nian, for they made Chariots so small, that they might be couered with and vnder a flye, and in the brim thereof they wrote two exameter verses in Golden letters. And of Calli∣crates, Solinus writeth, that hee made little Emmets out of Iuory so artificially, that it could not be discerned from the liue ones: euen so, nature hath stroue and strained, to excell more in these vile creatures of no reputation, then in greater and nobler creatures. There is nothing that consisteth of matter and forme, but that one of them is worthyer, and the other vile; and therefore the body and the soule in man, haue the respect of mat∣ter, and the soul is the form, because of the power of mouing▪ sences, and actions: where¦fore when we see all these powers, as it were predominant in a little creature that hath al∣most no body (as the outward proportion of Emmets and Bees) what shal we thinke? but how admirably is it able to worke without the matter in the forme alone, shewing it in a kind of visible nakednes, to be seene without the help of corporall Organs; and therefore they are not set before vs like sports & pastimes to reioyce at, but as honorable emblems of Diuine and supernaturall wisedome. For if we admire the little body of a man, because he beareth the most glorious ymage of all thinges in his proportion, and the ymage of God in his soule and minde, then certainely next to a man, wee ought to admire these beasts, which do so resemble man, as man doeth the eternall and liuing God, creator of them and him. Pliny vnskilfully calleth nature the common parent of al creatures, which indeed is the infinite maiesty of God; yet he writeth effectually, that there was no liuing creature made onely for this cause, that it should eat, or that it should satiate and satisfie other, but also it was ordained to be bred and brought foorth for sauing Arts; and there∣fore it is ingrafted euen in the bowels and intrals of deafe and dumbe things. Now for the creatures which are profitable to men, as sheep, Oxen, Horses, and such like, when we looke vppon them, wee cannot onely admire the wisedome and power of God in their creation, but also we ought to giue hereby thanks to his maiesty for their cre∣ation and conseruation in their seuerall kinds and orders, for the vse and behoofe of men. And for those things which are altogither vnprofitable to men, we ought to woonder as much at their vilenesse, as they want of profitablenes: For those admirable gifts and po∣wers are not common to all little beasts, as we see they are in Elephants, Lyons, Camels, & such other, for then we should wonder at them the lesse; but yet in som of the litle ones there are farre more excellent properties then in any of the greatest. Consider with what art and indrustry the Bee frameth her Combe, and the Emmet storeth her nest, and tell me if the wit and eloquence of man, be able sufficiently to expresse and praise it? Beside, their perpetuall concord, dilligence, and agreement in the administration, gathring, and spending of all their store, inso much as eyther they seem to be deriued from nature or els from a deep reach of wit, reason, and vnderstanding: neither are they the lesse admirable if we grant that these vertures are not natural and proper, nor proceeding from reason & wil, for they are no lesse the strange or stranger worke of God: For what a Diuine thing is it, that these beasts attaine to that vpon a sudden, without instruction and teaching, and therefore by instinct and a kind of reuelation which men do not attaine in long exercise, practise & study? These are assuredly euident testimonies of diuinity (for the Lord is mer∣uailous in al his works, either in nature, or reason & wil, or contrary to both, without al in∣terceeding mean, for al these haue dependance vpon his pleasure. For how can his Diuine power, wisedome, and goodnesse, euer be absent from the world, (I meane from man the prince of the world) when such excellent gifts are made visible in little beasts, that euerie day perish and are corrupted easily, and ingendered againe by their owne putrifaction, so as they neuer faile in kind, euen those that are so smal & little in body, that they can scarse be seen by the eies of man? these things are to me vnanswerable argumēts of the presence and power of God: for that they moue and bee in action it proceedeth of his power, in that they vse their sences, and there by follow and attaine those things which are profita∣ble to them, and avoyd al hurtful things contrary to their nature, because they build them houses and places of habitation, make prouision for their food and victuals it proceedeth of his wisedome; but in that they nourish their young ones, & loue one another in al out∣ward appearance, liuing in flocks togither, as if they had knowledge of society, and con∣sent vnanimously to their work and labour, it is likewise a token and visible emblem of his goodnes. The first cause therefore of these virtues, or whatsoeuer you wil cal them, Idea, or Original, must needs be the absolute example of God the Creator. And wee must not suppose, that his most excellent Maiesty hath proponed these pat∣ternes vnto vs by chance or rashly, without purpose of this end; that it should be to vs as cleare as the light ( Omnia diuinitatis esse plena ) that all things are full of his Diuinity: see∣ing that a Sparrow lighteth not on the ground without his will : And the poet saide: God is in the middest of Beasts, Men, Markets, and Sea. And heere I cannot containe my selfe from relating the words of Aristotle, for I trust that no man will blame me, if I alledge and write any thing truely and fitly, although it be in another mans words: for it is not to be regarded who saith, but what is sayed or spoken. Thus therefore he writeth: Among those creatures which are lesse acceptable to our sences, nature which is the common mother of all, hath ordained many delightes and pleasures in them, for men which vnderstand their cause or can reason of their Natures liberally: for this thing is absurd and farre from all reason, that because we cannot looke vppon the ymages and vpper faces of creatures and naturall thinges, painted and fra∣med, without we also behold in them the wit and Art of the Painter, and that therefore we can take lesse pleasure in the worke, for the Worke-mans sake. For if we can attaine to the true causes, we shall no lesse kisse and imbrace the con∣templation of the very actions of naturall thinges, with woonderfull diligence and ala∣crity: and for this cause it is a base thinge to despise the nature and constitution of the smaller and viler beasts, fit for Boyes and childish minds; for there is not any work of na∣ture, wherein there is not some wonderfull thing, therefore that is true which Heraclitus sayed to them that followed him vnto a hot-house, wherein he sat to warme his body, and when he perceiued that they were affraid to come in, he cryed out vnto them, that they should abstaine & forbeare to enter boldly, because Ne hinc quidem loco desunt dij immor∣talis: That euen in this place you shall finde the immortall Gods. And this rule must be followed in looking into the nature of Beasts: for we ought to enter into their consideration without feare or blushing, seeing the operation of nature is euery where very honest and beautifull, for therein is nothing done inconsideratly, and without a true end, but all things aduisedly for a certain and determinat purpose, and this purpose doth alway containe both goodnes and honesty. But if any man be so Barbarous, as to thinke that the beasts and such other, creatures, cannot affoord him any subiect woorthy of his contempaltion, then let him thinke so of himselfe likewise; for what ignoble basenesse is there in bloode, flesh, bones, vaines, and such like? Doth not the body of man consist thereof? And then how abhominable art thou to thy selfe, that doest not rather looke into these which are so neere of kinde vn∣to thee? And I may adde as much of them, that reason of matter without forme, or vse forme without matter, as of a house without the sides, or of a vessell without the best part; and and so is he that looketh vppon one part of nature and not the whole: or on those things which cannot be seuered from the substaunce, Thus farre Aristotle, whose wordes I haue expressed at large, because as we haue borrowed all his substance, and inserted it into our discourse, so I thought it not good to omit his preface. Seeing these thinges are thus, we cannot but thinke that euery story of a beast is like a seuerall Hymne, to praise the Diuine wisdome and goodnes, from which as from a pure euer-springing-fountaine, proceed and flow all good, beautifull, and wise actions: First, thorough the heauenly spirits and degrees of Angels and celestial bodies: afterward tho∣rough the minds of men, beginning at the highest, and so proceeding to the lowest, (for euen in men the giftes and graces of God differ,) and from men to other creatures that haue life or sence; as to plants and inanimate bodyes, so as the inferiors do alwaies so com∣pose themselues to the imitation of the superiours, euen as their shaddowes and resem∣blaunces. And in these doth Diuinity descend, first to supernaturall things, and then to things naturall: and we must turne saile and ascend first by things naturall, before we can attaine and reach thinges supernaturall. In the meane time Diuinity it selfe remaineth one and the same, without change and alteration, notwithstanding the manifold increasings and decreasings of all these creatures, which it vseth but as Glasses and Organs; and ac∣cording to the diuersity both of matter and forme, it shineth and appeareth in one and other more or lesse, euen as we see in our owne bodies, whose soule is disseminated in∣to euery part and member, yet is there a more liuely representation thereof in one part and member, then in another, and the faculties more visibly and sensibly appeare in the vpper then in the neather partes; But yet with this difference, that the soule is so ioyned to the body, as with a kind of Sympathy it suffereth harme and ioy with the sub∣iect wherein it is circumscribed, but none of these things do happen to the Diuinity: for it is so communicated to creatures, as it neither is any part or matter, or forme of them; nor yet can be affected by any thing the creature suffereth, nor yet included in the crea∣ture; but yet is in all, and ouer all, and without all, and aboue all, compassing, filling, and surpassing heauen and earth: infinite and impossible, and concluding the whole World, visible and inuisible. And truely these thinges surpasse all the wit of man, for we are not able with thought, and much lesse with wordes, to expresse it, and yet we ought not to be deterred for any cause from the consideration and contemplation thereof, but rather after we haue wa∣ded in the same, with all humility to acknowledge his power, and to view all the helps for our infirmitimes: to admire his wisedome, and endeuour thereby to amend our igno∣rance and encrease our knowledge: and in conclusion, to beate downe our pride and malice, by praysing and extolling his grace and goodnesse. For being thus affected and conuersant, in beholding these neather and backer partes of God, confessing with thankes giuing that all these thinges doe proceede from his Diuinity, we cannot stay but ascend vppe higher, to the worker himselfe, vsing all thinges in this life but as Prickes and Spurres, for occasion and admonitions to thinke vppon and reuerence the prime Author. For we haue continuall neede in this World to be put in mind and incited to the study and contemplation of heauenly thinges: and so we shall leaue all these things behind vs after this mortal life ended, and by the help of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, who by his onely death hath prepared for vs a way to the kingdome of ineffable glory, where we shall partake with the forepartes, and most cleare reuelation of the vnspeakeable ma∣iesty of God for this is the end of our life, for which we were created, and also the scope and conclusion of all naturall knowledge of the works of God. And least that any man should thinke that these thinges are ours, or the heathen Phylosphers sayings, and cannot be defended out of the sacred and supreme Testimony of holy Scriptures, I will also adde some few sayings recorded in the booke of God. First of all therefore, when in the beginning of the World God was about to create man, who was to vse al things, and to behold them in this World as it were in a Theater, he created all kind of Beastes and creatures before man, that he might bring him into a house fur∣nished and adorned with all thinges necessary and delectable: Afterward he brought into his presence all the creatures to bee named by him, which the Scripture recordeth for excellency sake, (for it is no doubt but he named all thinges that should continue to the Worldes end) yet expressely there is no mention but of liuing creatures, as Fishes, Foules, Cattell, and creeping things; that so they might be submitted and vassalaged to his Empire, authority, and gouernment: which thing least it should seeme but a proud coniecture, it is againe repeated in the blessing that God pronounceth to man and all his posterity; and againe after the floud vnto Noah and his Childeren. Euery beast (saith God) shall be afraid of you, both the Beastes of the earth, and the Foules of heauen, and what so∣euer is bred in the earth, or brought forth in the Sea; all are yours, whatsoeuer liueth and moueth it is permitted to you for meate. And before when the floud was at hand, God commaunded Noah to suffer all beastes that could not liue in the Water to enter the Arke, and of Foules and cleane Birds seuen of a kind, of impure, couples; to the intent that as for man they were at first created, and produced out of the earth, so hee would that man should concerue their kindes, with∣out contempt of them that were vncleane beasts. Furthermore in the booke of Kings, we read of Salomon, that God gaue him such wise∣dome, that he excelled all the wise and learned men of the world, and among other fruits and tokens of that wisedome there is remembred his parables three thousand, his verses aboue fiue thousande, his History of plantes from the high Caedar, to the Hysope stalke, and lastly his discourse of Beasts, Birds, Fishes, and creeping things. What is man (sayth Dauid ) that thou shouldst so remember him, or the sonne of man, that thou shouldst visite him. Thou hast set him ouer the works of thy hands, and hast set all things vnder his feet: Oxen sheep, Foules, Fishes, and whatsoeuer moueth in the Waters. And the same King and prophet in another place. Psal. 148. Praise the Lord, Dragons and all deepes, ye wilde beasts and creeping creatures. But how can Beastes praise the Lord? Or how could they vnderstand the Pro∣phets exhortation? Surely, therefore we are commaunded to praise God for them, con∣fessing his goodnesse and wisedome in all these beastes which hee produced for the orna∣ment of this present world. And because of these creatures the works of God, the Apostle S. Paule in the Epistle to the Romans, Chapt. 2. telleth the Ethinckes that they are vnexcusable before God, for that they knew him by the creatures of his works, and yet did not glorifie him as God, neither were gratefull: For the inuisible thinges of God, as his eternall power and wisedome are seene by the creation of the World. And lastly in the History of Iob. Ch. 38, 39. you shall find a large discourse to Iob from the Lords owne mouth, concerning many beasts. And these thinges may bee spoken, concerning the excellency and dignity of the History of beasts, whereunto I will adde some examples of the most famous men and Kings of the world, to shew what account they made of this learning: and so I will conclude this Prae∣face. First what account heereof was made by Alexander the great, may be gathered by that which Pliny writeth, for he saith, that he being enflamed with the desire to know the beasts and natures of creatures, appointed Aristotle (that infinite learned man) to write his books of creatures, commaunding many thousands, both in Asia and Graecia, which exercised Hunting, Hawking, Fishing, or that kepte Parkes, Heards of cattell, Fish-ponds, or any cages or other places and groues for Birds, to be at the commaund of the said Aristotle if neede were, to supply his desires in the knowledge of beastes; So that whatsoeuer was knowne in the whole world, might not be vnknowne to him: by whose helps (Pliny affir∣meth,) that hee wrote first the volumes, which hee saith he had abridged, to shew to the World in a short view the fruites of those desires, of the most Noble amonge all Kings. When Aristotle had finished this story and offered the same to King Alexander, hee offered him for his paines fovre hundered tallents; saying that it was a Kings gift to re∣ward such a knowledge; wherein, beside other parts of learning, Riding, Hunting, Haw∣king, and Fishing, which were Princely sportes were deciphered. But if Alexander were now aliue, he would wonder, that among innumerable other princely bounties which he conferred and bestowed vpon the World, there should bee none that so encreased his honor and continueth his fame, as this one worke, although it bee contemned among many vulgar, base minded men; for he ouercame almost all the kingdomes of the world, and builded great Citties, but his owne kingdom soon after becam distracted, and rent in foure peeces, and so deuolued, one part to the Romans, and other parts to other Kings, the Citties are either ouerthrowne, or the names chaunged, or inhabited by Barbarous people, altogether vnlearned, that doe not so much as now remember or acknowledge who was there first founder. Also there haue perished the bookes of many writers that compiled his History, and set forth his valiant actes and renowned fortunes, so that of many, there scarce remay∣neth one or two. But the History of beastes and other creatures, which was made at his cost and charges, hath runne through many ages and beene preserued for a thousand and nine hundered yeares, to the great glory and commendation both of the King, and the writer Aristotle. And he is not more honored for his liberality toward the Phylosopher for his worke among posterity, but also the fruite and vtilitye thereof to all ages, hath beene greater then any that arose from the kingdomes that he got, or the battailes that he wan; for how can posterity account that beneficiall to them, which the men of that age found by experi∣ence to be so hurtfull and full of calamity? Many thousandes of men perished onely for the pleasure of one ALEXANDERS ambitious desire of raygning, many Common-wealthes were chaunged, Regions and countries wasted, and many publicke and priuat miseries followed, as is vsuall where warre ouerturneth kingdomes. Therefore I say againe, he neuer did any thing in all his life, whereby he wan so great fame and renowne, then by being first of all the occasion to Aristotle, to vndertake the labour, and then afterward a liberall rewarder thereof. Petrus Gillius writeth, that all the stories of creatures were either compiled by Kings, or else dedicated to Kings; for to omit others who were diligent in heards, and curious enquirers into the natures of beasts, Iuba, Hieron, Attalus, Philometor, and Archelaus, wrot many thinges of the force and nature of creatures. Opp anus Anazarbensis (a most learned Poet) when he had finished his poems of the creatures, he dedicated them to Antoninus, the Sonne of the Emperour Seuerus ; for which, hee was bidden to aske what he would: and whereas he was but a banished man, he asked liberty to dwell againe at home in his owne Country, which he not onely obtained, but also receiued for euery verse a peece of Gold worth a Noble, and there were in his two poems, about fiue thousand and eight hundered verses: for which cause the learned Poet in ioy of such a reward, wrote his verses in Gold, bycause he saide he would haue it worthily called a Golden Poem. Of this kind he wrote two, one of hunting, and another of fishing. C. Plinius Secundus wrote a story of the World, wherein he writeth but briefely of all thinges in the World, and yet largely and copiously of plants and beasts, and so dedica∣ted it to the Emperor Vespasian, for which hee was alway deare and familiar vnto him. Auicen being an excellent Physitian and a counseller of estate to Vzirus a King of Persia, for which dignity many called him a Prince, yet he disdained not to write of beastes, and to interpret Aristotle in many of those books. And this is no maruaile that so many of the ancientes did thus magnifie the knowledge of all kindes of creatures, seeing as Varro writeth, they were almost all Sheapheards, Goate-heardes, Neat-heards, and therefore they said that their flocks had Golden fleeces, for the commodity they found in them, as Atreus at Argos, and Aeetes at C lchos. Who is he but he knoweth that the Roman peo∣ple had their originall from Sheapheards? Who knoweth not that Faustulus the Nurse of Romulus and Remus, was a Sheapheard? And this was an argument hereof, because that they builded their citty for Sheapheards, that they appointed amercements by Oxen and Sheepe, and that they stamped their Mony with such pictures: and how many names are there among the Romans deriued from cattell and sheep, as Ouinius, Caprillus, Equi∣tius, Taurus, and sur-names also, as Annij, Caprae, Statilij Tauri, and Pomponij Vituli. We reade in holy scripture that Abraham was onely rich in cattell, and that King Da∣uid did keepe his fathers flock, and hereunto also belongeth, that the most wise and great men among the ancients were students in Anatomy, and the dissection of parts of mens bodies, instituting children therin from their first learning of letters; Now no man think that they fetched this knowledge from the partes of mens bodies at the beginning, but from beastes, as Dogs, Apes, Swine, and such other, wherewithall they were exercised as in rudiments and grounds, that they might be more prompt, ready, and experienced in the bodies of men. And among other Marcus the Roman Emperor was most skilfull and studious in this science of Anatomy, and the Egyptian Kings did the like with their owne handes. Boethus, and Paulus Sergius, two Roman Consuls, and other principall men, were auditors to Galen. Thus farre Conradus Gesner. In the next Epistle he discourseth to the reader of his method and order obserued in his books, and also of other necessary things belong∣ing to this History, which I haue thought good also to insert into this place. CONRADVS GESNERVS to the Reader. I Haue now sufficiently in my Epistle Dedicatory expressed by what occasion I came vnto this worke, how much I haue la∣boured in it, to shew what fruits may be had out of it, and with how great study, both Kings, and Princes, as also many great and most learned men haue reuerenced the history of Crea∣tures; the rest of which, I haue thought good to impart vnto the Reader in the beginning of my work, which I will seuerally propose: neither did it becomme to be more large in a dedica∣tion, beeing made vnto the principallest men of our Com∣monwealth. And because the greatnesse of the Booke before it be read of any man, may seeme to blame me to be too tedious, I will excuse it before I intreat of anything. Therefore first of all it is no maruaile though it be a great volume, in which I haue la∣boured to insert with diligent study, the writings of all men concerning all Foure-footed-liuing-beasts: and also the sayings of old and later Philosophers, Physitians, Gramari∣ans, Poets, Hystorians; and lastly of all kind of Authors: not onely of those which haue set foorth their workes in Latine, or Greeke, but of euery one also which haue set downe their works in Germany, France, Italy, and England : And most diligently of the sayings of those which haue written something of purpose concerning liuing creatures, but with the lesser care of other, which haue onely in the meane time remembred some sayings of the same, as Hystorians, and Poets. I haue put down also many proper obseruations, and haue gathred togither many things, nowe and then by asking questions, without reproach of any man, learned or vnlearned, Cittizens, or strangers, Hunters, Fishers, Fawkconers, Shepheards, and all kind of men. Also I haue not knowne any thing out of the writings of learned men, of many Nations, which they haue giuen to me, but I haue expressed the same. The formes also of euery liuing creature in this work, haue increased the volume, but chiefely the first Book (which is al Foure-footed-beastes liuing alike) hath out of measure increased it, because this kind of liuing creature, may be more familiarly known, and more profitable to man, chief∣ly to those of our Nation or Countrie: And also many haue written little and reasonable bookes of each of them, as the horse-leaches of horses, in Greeke and Latine, and the later writers in other languages, and so forth. Also many haue declared diuers things concerning Dogges, and the bríngers vp also of cattle, and heards of Beasts, Goats, Sheepe, and Sowes, haue pronounced many coun∣trey obseruations, both in Greeke and Latine. Some man may happen to say, that I ought not to make a Hystory out of all Bookes, but onely from the best; but I will not despise the writings of any man, seeing there is made no book so bad, from whence there cannot be some good sentence gathered out, if any man do applie his wit thereto. Therefore al∣though I haue not ouer-skipped anie kind of writer, yet I did it not rashly, for I haue pickt out no few obseruations of good moment from barbarous and obscure writers in diuers languages, so that I would not be iudged a negligent person to giue credit to euery thing, nor arrogant or vnmoddest, to despise the studies or labors of any man. Those things truely which I thought were false or any way absurd, I either altogether omitted them, or so placed as I may conuict them: or if at any time I haue not done it, it was either thorough lacke of knowledge, or for some other cause, which fault I thinke is very seldome committed, (except it be in those thinges which doe belong to Physicke, where we haue related very often many things both false and s perstitious, as happily an Amulet or preseruative against enchauntment is, and many other things which are of the same kind, that the good sayinges of learned men may be easily knowne) of the name of the Authour, and as much of euery thing as shall be thought worthy to be beleeued, let the Reader iudge, for I do not promise my owne Authority euery where, but am satisfi∣ed to recite the words and sentences of other writers. Wherefore I haue beene very di∣ligent, least at any time I should omit the name of an Authour, although it were in small matters, and also those which were commonly knowne, because there should remaine no doubt or scruple of any thing: The words also and sayings of euery Author, shalbe com∣pact together, if any man should be desirous to imitate or follow them. Therefore I haue been more copious, that I might not onely profit in the knowledge of words, but also haue sufficiently ministred a worke, or writing of words and speeches, for those which are desirous either to dispute, or write an Oration either in Greeke or Latine. But it could not be done more commodiously, that all things might bee written pure∣ly in Latine, seeing that I haue recited almost in the same words certaine things taken out of those which were rude or barbarous; chiefely because if any thing should be obscure or doubtfull: but the rest which were written of them, I haue altered to a moderate vse of the Latine tongue; not because I could not doe it better, but rather because such an elo∣cution doth seeme to adorne such Authors. But those sentences which I haue writ or coppied out of good and Latine Authors, I haue not altered any thing of them. And truely of my owne stile, or manner of writing, I can say no other then this, that I haue had a great care, although I could not pronounce it eligantly and wisely, nor after the imitation of the auncient writers, notwithstanding I haue pronounced it competent∣ly, and plainely in Latine. Neyther was it ydlenesse to frame such a stile or manner of writing, seeing that I was most of al busied in those things, as wel mutable as innumerable and in a manner I haue written those things which if they had beene gathered together I had put to presse many yeares before. The cause why I did neglect it was the feare least any thing shoulde be left out, and not verie much to seeke more matter, but for the most part the inscription was the cause, and the order and care that I had, least any thing, should be repeated in vain: Moreouer also because that the Argument did not require a graue or excellent maner of stile or speech, but a manifest and meane style, and most commonly a Gramarian, that is to say, fit for in∣terpretation. For I would not onely recite the words of the Authors, but oftentimes also where it was needefull, I did adde thereto the exposition or declaration; so that this volume may not onely be a history of liuing creatures, but also an exposition of the place of al those which haue written something of liuing creatures. For those which do vndertake to make any booke, must chiefely beware of two things, that the words and meaning of the Authour be declared and put together like places of the rest, the latter whereof I haue accompli∣shed in this worke by great labour, because the sayings both of other Authours, as wel as of one, concerning the same matter in diuers places are compiled together, and it would be a matter of lesse value to declare in more words the words of the Authours, when they among themselues haue so diligentlie gathered together the places, that they must bring them to mutual light. Notwithstanding if so be that it seemeth a worke to declare the wordes and sentences of the Authours; I haue done it for my owne helpe, and for others, and also in causes com∣prehended in other sentences as they so cal them, yet it doeth happen that I am freed by their nature from too dark a stile, from euery affectation or curious desire, of that thinge which nature hath not giuen, I leaue that care to those with whome wordes rather then matter are entertained. But that I may repeat more copiouslie in few words their sayings, that this book may But that I may repeate more copiously in few wordes their sayings that this booke may not be to large, therefore first of all I will entreate of that which is perfected by a num∣ber of Authors, and afterwards of that which I haue sundry times added thereto, because of my owne declaration. This booke might be much shorter, if I had not touched the loue of learning, in which I confesse I haue been too tedious and although this my diligence may be vnpro∣fitable to some, yet I hope it will bee pleasant and acceptable to the Grammarians and others, but truely it hath cost me great labour and many nightes watching. I call that the loue of learning whatsoeuer it is, that doth belong to a Grammarian, and diuersities of languages, prouerbs, or common sayings, semblables, tales, or fables, wherein bruite Beasts are fained to speake, the sayings of Poets, and lastly that which doth belong rather to words, then to the matters themselues. This and such like I haue done for the most part, The Reader must note that all th se following are spoken of his latin discorse hauing made a seuerall Chapter of those nges which belong to euery liuing creature, euen to the eight or last Treatise, yet notwithstanding sometimes they haue got in by stealth in the former Chapters, part∣ly because I was inuited by a small occasion, and with a certaine desire of the same, to change my purposes and partly because that the light of the Authors should seeme to bring profit to the places fitly recited or openly reade, that else where, as well as in the second chapter, I haue oftentimes also alledged somewhat more of Grammarians, Phi∣sitians, and other matters. In the third Chapter wherein I did entreat of the meates and diseases of liuing creatures, I oftentimes turned more copiously to entreate of the plantes by the which they were wholesomely nourished, or happily by the strength of the tast of them were hurt, or else killed: and after the same manner also in the first Chapter if there were any such rootes that the liuing creatures should perish by them throwne by the Hunters with some meate. But I haue professed and confessed in that loue of learning, that I was wont to name those plantes, and sometimes to write of many thinges which haue had their name after a certaine manner from some liuing creature. The seuenth Chapter entreateth of the remedies of liuing creatures, and of curing the hurts which they were wont to receiue by biting, or by a stroke, or by eating of meate. I do very often esteeme much of many thinges written in the desire of dignifieng medici∣nall matters. It is seene where the places of Authors being depraued and renewed, haue allowed occasion of digressing. To be short, wheresoeuer any rare thing, or that which is declared to others did offer it selfe, which being vnfolded should seeme to dignifie and honor common learning, I haue beene alured contrary to my institution, for the decla∣ring thereof: For when as being a child I was educated in the Greeke and Latine studies of Gramer and conference, & as yet being a young man had begun to profit therein: vn∣till growne vnto full age, I came to riper profession of Phylosophy, especially natural and Medicinall, (although out of the same I haue not a little increased my loue vnto lear∣ning, and made it more firme and solide, and very greedily haue exercised my selfe in reading of diuers matters) I could do somewhat more in the explications of matters and sayings, then I perswaded my selfe, the rude multitude would regard, especially in the age of inferiour students, and in the studies of those which are busied in other matters. Wherefore I haue written more freely and often more copiously of many thinges. I haue reprehended the ancient & the later (not with any intent to obscure others, and ad∣uantage my owne,) but sincerly and simply, as much as in me lyeth that I might aduance common studies. But if no man doe disalow their bookes (whom in no order but as any thing which commeth into their mindes;) expound the wordes and sayinges of diuers Authors in both tongues, as among auncient Writers, Macrobius, Gillius, Cassidorus, and whosoeuer haue written diuers things, (many whereof I haue declared in the second part of my Bybliotheca :) and amongst the latter many others, as most especially Guilielmus Budaeus, Coelius Rhodiginus & Chalcagninus, Polittanus, Erasmus Rotorodamus, &c. but as it were best of all by desertes, whatsoeuer any good man or meanely learned doth thinke of them. I doe not see by what right this our labour may be dispraised, wherein many thinges truely spoken of by others, but disordredly, many thinges by me being first deliuered, I haue so orderd and disposed that in a manner euery thing may be set in his owne proper place. As for al the chapters which we haue set down are not only of them, but euery chap¦ter hath his seuerall part and certaine order both the former and the latter, one Method and that continuall of the middle part being throughout the whole worke. And because sometime it did happen that something might seeme to be referred out of those, which I had directed into diuers other places, least I should be too tedious in repeating the same, and therefore for the most part I remitted it from one place, to one Author; vnlesse al the story might be repeated in few words. These and certaine other things (as the words of diuers Authors, and variety of stile) an vnequal, interrupted and a cumbersome worke, (as I may so call it) and (as some per∣chance will obiect they haue stored it alike with dissolute marks or purposes: which fault though I should vnderstand, I haue notwithstanding refused to commit, whiles that it should so profit: but this shall bee, (howsoeuer blemished it is) much lesse, if any may ghesse with himselfe that I haue composed al these things not by that order that they shold be knowne by continuall seriousnesse of reading of studious men: but so to haue tempe∣red them that whatsoeuer any man shal desire concerning any beast, that being presently found he may read it by it selfe, and wel vnderstand it. Therefore if any man will vse this worke only at seasonable times, who hath vsed dictionaries and such like common books, he shal be able to do these things profitably but if he shall not remember the order in the prescribed manner, let him take counsell of the table Alphabeticall, which wee will pub∣lish in the end of this our worke, but if nothing preuaile, in the meane time as we are all subiect to Censure through the Readers infirmity, the same in a manner, Pliny in the History of nature hath ordained: for in his Praeface to Vespasian he writeth; because wee must saith he) spare your labours for the common good, what may be contained in all my Bookes, I haue ioyned to this Epistle, and haue done my greatest endeuor with the di∣ligentest care, that thou shouldest haue these Bookes not to bee read ouer againe, and thou by this shalt be the occasion that other may not reade them ouer againe: but as euery one shall desire any thing, that he may onely seeke that, and know in what place he may find it, Valerius Soranus did this before me in his books which he inscribed Epopcido These things Pliny. They which desire to profit in this Art of Grammer, and to get the vse of some tong vnto themselues, who with a compounded Method (as they call it) deliuer their art from letters and sillables, to the sayings, and eight parts of speech, and last of all speech it selfe, and hauing come vnto the Sintaxis, doth desire the knowledge of art, in the meane time notwithstanding he doth not neglect the profit of Lexicons (wherein all sayings and spee∣ches are numbred, far otherwise then in the precepts of art, where neither all things seue∣rally, nor in any good order are rehearsed) not that from the beginning hee may reade through the end, which would be a worke more laboursome then profitable, but that he may aske counsell of them in due season. In like manner he that is desirous to know the History of beasts, and will read it through with continuall seriousnesse, let him require the same of Aristotle, and of other likewise that haue written, and let him vse our volume as a Lexicon, or as my owne Onomasticon. For it is not vnknowne vnto me that Aristotle doth teach in his booke, entituled the partes of beasts, that it maketh much (to the description of Phylosophy) and that it is more lear∣ned so to write concerning beastes, that aswell the parts, as the effects might also be hand∣led common to more, their History being vnfolded by certaine common places: First by prosecuting those things which are most common, and somewhat vnto things that are lesse common lastly by loking backe and descending into those things, which onely shall be proper vnto certaine kinds and vulgar shapes: for if in all beasts any man would seuer∣rally consider the parts and effects, there will many things fall out by the way to be consi∣dered, and inquired after, which (he saith) will be very absurd, and also proue too tedious. This discommodity, although I should well vnderstand, yet I would notwitstanding seue∣rally prosecute the History of beasts, which thing is to be handled in our time wherin the names of very many are not vnderstood, I should iudge would be more profitable, and I should thinke it lesse absurd, that somethings should more often be sought after, being ordai∣ned for the order of the same, that this work might rather serue for inuestigation then con¦tinuall reading: I haue not notwithstanding euen in al Beasts placed euery thing which is incident to euery kind, both for as much as certaine thinges are knowne to some men, as most common partes of Foure-footed-Beastes, as also if any man shall doubt in some thinges, he may refer himselfe into the places of Aristotle, wherein those things are handled generally: and perhaps we also at sometime or other wil according to the kinds and shapes of Foure-footed-Beastes discourse of somewhat more particular. And because I had determined, it was more commodious for a History to be made by vs concerning all Beasts, euen in that name or title which not Phisically, or onely Philo∣sophically, but Medicinally, & also grammatically concerning one thing: Neither doth it want the exampls of learnedmen, for scarce the one or the other as Theophrastus & Ruellius haue deliuered any thing concerning plants, according to that Method, which in com∣mon parts and effectes hath manifested all plants of the earth, but very many haue descri∣bed seuerall plants seuerally, and in times past out of our age (especially Physitians) Ru∣ellius for the most part laboured in both, (as Galen also) but onely in describing of apt∣nesse. Indeede I confesse, that I could be far more briefe in many more things (although my purpose remaine) aboue all other thinges, euen that exquisite desire of my diligence had delighted me, when that same saying of Liuy came into my mind, in a certaine volume, beginning after this manner: Now sufficient glory was gotten for him, and hee could cease himselfe, vnlesse his mind should be daily fed with worke, although (as Pliny saith) the greater should the reward be for the loue of worke (which better became him not to haue composed it to his owne,) but to the glory of the Romaine name, and not to haue perseuered onely to please his owne minde, but to haue set forth the same to the profit of the people of Rome. I would haue you iudge, that I haue not kept back or stayed my course in these my la∣bours, not onely for fauoring my selfe, or getting glory to my selfe, (although Liuius did so) but rather to make the truth more plaine pertaining to Histories, or to the people of Rome: Notwithstanding I think that he spake more modestly, least if he should have spo∣ken after that manner which Pliny doth require, he should be iudged to haue been more arrogant) as one which should foretell any thing to the worthyest people of the whole World, or any thing of the honor of the Conqueror of those Nations, he would say that they must come from him. Likewise although this worke (what soeuer it is) do not de∣sire to be done wholy for my selfe, but for the gouernors and rulers, of the common∣wealth, and to the gouernors of the vniuersity or Academy, which haue fauoured mee euen from a Child of their owne liberality, and do still continue their fauor vnto me, and do exhort me to finish those things which I haue begun already: and if there should arise any fame or renowne from thence, it should chiefely light vpon them: Yet least I should be deceiued, I willingly hold my peace, and the rest I leaue to iudgement, whyther any thing may happen from this worke so praise-worthy and of excellent fame, and yet not vnworthye of praise, for to the Senate, and to the vniuersity I owe much time, with ma∣ny names of worth to those most excellent men of learning, and other different ver∣tues. But least happily I be held too tedious, while I excuse the largenesse of the worke, al∣though (by the way I haue handled some other thinges all vnder one) that I might shew certaine commodities arising from them, and also I might excuse our stile. I will pro∣ceede and go forward to the rest. And although from our foresayings it may be sufficiently manifested of our exceeding great labour, and also the greatnesse of the volume, as well as the variety and difficulty of things, therein expressed, may boldly speake for me, yet I will a e thereunto very many things if thereby the censures of learned men doe happen more reasonable, benigne & fauorable, and doe aduertise and admonish me that I haue offended at any time, I will sub∣scribe and follow their opinions, but for the Censures of vnlearned I little regard. For I haue endeuored my selfe with great and painefull labour, although they are not corre∣spondent in all thinges, that they may merrit pardon: and (as he saith) in a great worke it is thought lawfull to breake much sleepe. Pliny doth write that he hath finished his naturall or lawfull History from a hundered of choice or curious Authors, and hath added too very many matters, which either they haue not knowne, or afterwardes had beene deuised or inuented in their life time: nei∣ther do wee doubt (saith he) but that there are many thinges which also we haue ouer∣skipped. I desire also that the same may be vnderstood of this our volume, although it is not onely made ready and fit to me by a hundered Authors, but also by many others as you may easily count or reckon by the Catalogue of them, which I haue also set downe. But first of all what labour and paines it was to read all thinges diligently and with iudge∣ment, afterward to take and chuse thinges, to reduce and restore them to their owne or∣ders againe: and againe confer and compare them while you are writing the worke, as if many should haue said one thing, being plainely expressed of Authors, and changed by other names: others stealing priuily by names suppressed. But how hard & tedious a labour it is, so to confer the whole writings of Authors, to re∣duce all of them as it were into one body, that nothing may bee omitted, nor any thing vnaduisedly repeated, no man doeth vnderstand, except he be learned: truely this doth so happen onely in comparing or conferring two or three bookes, but most of all in con∣ferring of very many Bookes as we haue done: and that so diligently, as heareafter there shall bee little neede of looking into other Authors concerning those matters. But hee which will haue this volume ought to perswade himselfe that he hath all thinges concer∣ning those matters written at large, that is to say, one booke for a Library, one more excellent then many others. When Peeter Gillius before vs had done thus, but in few Authors; the Graecians (saith he) which haue written concerning Beastes, wee haue not only made Latins which was very easie, but also imitating Dionysius Cassius who translated Mago, we allowed both order and iudgment. But I should more iustly speake these things concerning our selues who haue follow∣ed an order far more commodious, and haue conferred many more Writinges of Au∣thors, both others (as I haue already said) as also for al the most part translated out of the Graecians, and from others, and from Gillius himselfe. Therfore I haue more often set down the Graecians sayings, where either the interpreters did seeme to erre, or the words or locutions did containe some rare or excellent things or peculiar to the matter. I haue also translated many my selfe, either that were not as yet translated, or that I would translate a Graecian saying discretly, and then dispute the matter with the interpreter. But of the Germans French, and Italians I haue translated certaine into Latine: I haue sustained much watchfull labour in reading, gathring, confer∣ring, and writing ouer those workes and stories many yeares: which truely what and how many they haue beene, cannot easily be beleeued, vnlesse of expert men: although I can∣not easily see any man should assay the like matter, to bring into one vniforme body all the sayings of all writers, as many as could bee had of one argument: for I haue knowne certaine men who out of many things haue written some, out of all, none. Wherefore I can say that of my labours which Aristides spake concerning the elegance of the Citty of Smyrna, which was, that no man except he which shall see it will be drawen to beleeue it: That which appertaineth to the stile, although in the precedent sayings I haue spoken certaine thinges incidently digressing from the matter, heere I will very priuately and wa∣rily adde some things. Therefore I haue vsed a meane phrase or speeche, in no mans wisedome too fine or curious, most chiefely for the causes aboue declared: For in those writinges wherein the knowledge of things is sought (as Massarius saith in the like argument) is not the com∣linesse of a famous or eloquent Oration, but to expresse a sound and perfect truth. But such workes are neither capable of wit, as I may say with Pliny, which was otherwise very meane or moderate to vse it: neither do they allow of excesse, either in Orations, or speeches, or wonderfull chances or aduentures, or diuers euents, or other pleasant things, or in any delectable or friendly things. Let the nature of things be declared in a barren or fruitelesse argument, that is to say the life of them, and this was base also on his part, by putting to many thinges with rusticall and strange denominations, yea also Barbarous, euen with the Praeface of estimation and reputation: And so far forth Plinius. But if that most learned man, and the most eloquent by the iudgement of all men, and which hath drawne or sucked out the cleanenesse or purenesse of the Latine tongue with Milke, and the vse of other commodities, and whereupon the desire of wit might much encourage him, being helped or pricked forward by Mecaenas his gouernor Vespa∣sianus, (of the penuriousnesse, and basenesse of the phrase, almost in the like argument) doth desire, to frame or make an excuse so much the more warily should I do this for many causes, which I will not expresse because I may not be to long. Wherefore some thinges are repeated heare and there in, diuers places of this worke, I gaue a reason euen before, truely because the order appointed of vs did so require, and the diuision of chap∣ters and parts in euery one of them, that it may not be written with negligence, but ra∣ther with exact, and curious diligence. But certaine things are repeated sometimes in the same place, which may seeme to be beside the purpose being known or perceiued; but if euery man would consider it distinct∣ly, he would easily vnderstand how little it weare either in matter or wordes: for some∣times the peculiar or vulgar speech, or the eloquency of wordes did cause that I should do so, that it might haue that which might be imitated in speaking, if any man would la∣bour or endeuour, either to speake or write any thing of the same matter. Parentheses also do belong to the stile as the Grammarians call them, which are very many euery wher¦in the whole worke, and that for many causes: either because the reading or gathering is variable or vnlike, or the manner of writing did disagree, or because our correction or o∣thers was added thereto, or that I might translate it, or that I might fill or finish it if any thing should be wanting, or that I might adde thereunto that which might delight the eloquency thereof, or do somthing peculiar to the matter present, if the Latine should seeme not sufficiently translated of them: And lastly simply to a more intelligible vnder∣standing of those thinges with which they are mingled. As much as belongs to the right forme of writing, I haue not alwaies written the same tearmes, or names after the same maner, but according to the Authors I haue very oftentimes changed, whose words I did rehearse or recite. This is of the stile and elocution. That which doe belong to these thinges, and to the truth and certainety of them, I do not promise my credit in very many of them, but yet am well pleased to put downe the names of the Authors, with whom let those thinges remaine. And truely the grea∣test part of them do merrit faith or credite, which are fortified, or defended by the con∣sent of many learned men, euen now in many ages, as also that in this fauour or benefit, very many of the Authors named of vs, and happily some of them are repeated not with any great fruite or profit, and yet are not to bee misliked. Therefore it is more wor∣thy to bee beleeued, if one matter may bee spoken in the same wordes of many wit∣nesses. I confesse that there are some vaine glorious things, but they are not many, (as Gillius saith in his translation of Aelianus ) which we haue added or put to this worke, but they are recompenced, and amended with a great number of other graue and learned transla∣tions: and as if Fathers and Grand-Fathers should delight of a Mold in the ioyntes or knuckle of their Children, that is to say, Fooles which do not weigh or valew other mens workes. As for slanderers I do not care: for those men are the best as Cato declareth, which are skilfull or experienced in true praise. Which thing if I haue not done to the full, and ample (also I vsed the same wordes which Massarius writ in his translation of Fishes) let not my study be blamed which truely is most vehement, and ardent in the same, because at this time I could do no more. Let the indifferent Readers iudge, how confused a matter I tooke vpon me to handle, neither did I euer thinke that I should haue brought it to so good a passe. But how much before time we haue done in helping or succoring good Arts, let others also do as much, which afterwardes haue clattered out of measure. For neither will wee beare an euill discontented mind, if they bring their helpes or labours of other skilfull men, to this exceeding great and hard labour which we haue vndertaken, and shall go beyond or excell vs. They report that Paedarotus that singular or excellent man, who when he was not cho∣sen in the number of three hundered men, which order did shew or represent dignity or estimation among the Lacedemonians, went away merry and laughing, and being cal∣led backe againe of Ephorus the Historian, being demaunded why he laughed, answered: because truely I reioyced that our citty had 3. hundered Cittizens better learned then my selfe. Furthermore although I haue manifested hitherto almost al the writings of al things concerning Foure-footed-Beastes which haue come to my hands, and haue comprehen∣ded or compassed them in our workes or Stories: Notwithstanding for all that, I desired to haue some superfluous or vnprofitable Bookes heareafter of other things, but I neuer thought I should haue brought it passe; for it is equity and reason that all things should stand in their proper place and dignity, that all may profit which will, which thing I doe altogether desire. For somethings for antiquity sake do deserue, to be warily obserued, other some also for their Phylosophicall Method, and Method partaining to Logicke, or some matter differing from ours; othersome for eloqution, and othersome for all these causes, wherfore we haue principally obserued the Graecians, fauoring their language & speech. There are some which haue published (saith Gillius ) in their writings all the nature which is comprehended or contained in Foure footed-Beastes, as Aristotle, Pliny, and other auncient Writers: Moreouer the controuersie or labour of whom, I dare not say was manifestly finished or performed, although many excellent thinges were begun of them concerning foure-footed-Beasts. For truely me thinkes that such scrupelous Authors haue perfectly distinguished so many thinges of the signification and nature of Foure-footed-Beastes, that there is left no more roome in any place, for idle or negligent men to make a new discription or inuention. It is manifest also that Aristarchus and Solinus did no other thing in two and forty yeare, then marke and consider the maner and fashion of them, and so committed them to writing. It is a hard thing (as I may speake with Pliny) to offer or commit nouelty to olde or auncient things, and to giue authority to things not seene afore, and to giue credit to things decayed or growne out of vse, and to bring to light obscure or difficult thinges, and to giue reputation to thinges full of disdaine, and credit to thinges doubtfull: but to giue credit to the nature of all thinges, and all thinges belonging to their nature. Therefore I haue not desired to haue followed altogether that which is excellent and sumptuous. Truely the peculiar cause of them is in mens desires, who because they would please every one, haue esteemed or set more by painefulnesse passed ouer and al∣lowed, then to help forward vtility or commodity newly found out. For what is more commendable from all the labour of learning, then to vndertake or enterprize so boun∣tifull and commendable a charge, or businesse, then of renewing old and ancient things which were forgotten, or rather to restore things from Death, or ruine which were sould thereto, and to restore the names of things, and things by their names? Great fauour ought to bee giuen to those also which doe regard the common waies, and doe spread, stengthen, defend, clense, expounde, declare, pollish, or finish, make perfect, and lastly do so rule and traine them, that they may be tractable to all trauelers thereby; and to all labering beasts whatsoeuer they are, whose helpes we vse in Carts, or Waggons, and may performe and accomplish them without danger, or any impediment or hinde∣rance, although they cannot sustaine or beare all hinderances, yet almost the greater part of them. Neither doe they deserue little praise or commendations in learning, which haue so polished or trimmed vp some worke vndertaken for publike profit, that to the rest or remnant in the same argument, there shall be no complaint or little at all hereafter, of the difficulty thereof, which therefore if it be in my instruction, I shall be very glad, seeing that I did desire to follow it: if not, somthing that I haue performed on the great part is, that the learned men stirred vp in this businesse by vs, may not quit or absolue that which is left behind. Therefore most excellent and indifferent Reader, fauor ye this labour some, honest, pleasant, profitable, and variable worke: and giue the greatest thankes to God, and I be∣seech you that if you proceede any further in this mortall life because it doth not profit to bee idle, that you rather bestowe some time in the searching out of nature, and that you make a gratfull Solemnization and setting forth of Gods workes before any other things, which either labour or immoderate desire may set out to our exercises and endeuours, we may bee exercised also in holinesse and Godlinesse, and may communi∣cate and consvlt thinges requisite, with great labour and diligence to the Ages to come. Therefore in the meane time I beseech all good and painefull men, that if there be any of them which haue something to the finishing vp of this worke, to bring it, although it be of neuer so little moment, as are the shapes and formes of euery kinde of Foure-footed-Beastes, or Historyes, that is to say; whatsoeuer it is that can lead vs more amply to know the nature of them: or blaming those things in which we haue erred, which truely I which I am the man thinke there are many, yet I do not doubt but that they may wittily and fa∣uorably communicate with ours, and may as it were make famous this publique worke, being placed in the middle, which thing also is profitable and excellent to them, and de∣lectable to mee, and continually to all learned men heareafter. That there hath beene a partaker, or companion of this excellent worke he shall be in aduancement. If I shall be admonished of my error in few things, nay onely in one thing, I presently will correct it without enuy or mallice: or will put thereto some new matter, either to the second volume of the rest of Foure-footed-Beasts, or otherwise in the addition: And least I should seeme vngrateful to those which haue contributed or bestowed somthing to this, contrary to the loue which I should alwaies beare to them, if no other benefit shall be ren∣dered to them, as our estate is but mean, yet at leastwise I will declare my mind in a frend∣ly commemoration to a number of their names in their Catalogue, by whom I haue pro∣fited. But if any, either through a destitute or forsaken occasion, or for any other cause or disposition, are forced to write or send somthing to vs, and also shall desire publiquely to correct some of our errors which we haue committed, which I know many can do graue∣ly, and also learnedly, and I desire that they may doe it, & entreat of them that they write learnedly and modestly, and to do it so, that the common wealth pertaining to learning, may rather aduance and premote him, then either to wrong his credit or renowne, or any cause of blaming or rebuking vs, as it becommeth men of courage, truely to see into it. I am alwaies ready to amend my own, from any iust correction or blame, but not depriue any man of his owne praise. For I hope (without offence be it spoken here) that this our labour or paines shall remaine to the worlds end, not through the merrit or desert of our learninge, (which is but small) but through our diligence, which hath ioy∣ned together most diligently and exactly, so many and great labours and stories, from a number of Authors, as it were into one treasury or Store-house. Farewell TO THE LEARNED Readers. A Fter I had expressed these two Epistles of Conradus Gesner ▪ in the former whereof, he declareth to the States-men of Zu∣ricke the vtility of the story, and in the latter his excuses or reasons of his method in his latter workes: I thought good also to followe him in his Apology of the Authours, out of whose writings he had taken any part of his story: Although I haue not nor could not obserue his words, method, forme, and matter in all things in this my English collection, not onely because his purpose was to gather all that had beene written of euery beast, & to leaue the same (as he professeth) like a Dictionary, for the priuate vse of learned men, but also because my purpose was, to shew to euery plaine and honest man, the wonderfull workes of God in euery beast in his vulgar toongue, and giue occasion to my louing friendes and Country-men, to adde of themselues, or else to helpe mee with their owne obseruations vppon these stories: yet forasmuch as I must acknowledge him my Authour, by the helpe of whose eies I haue seene almost all that I haue wrote, I will say as he doth out of Plinius Secundus, Est e∣nim benignum vt arbitror & plenum ingenui pudoris, fateri per quos profeceris non vt pleri{que} quos attigi, fecerunt. That is, It is a signe of a good nature replenished with all modestie; to confesse the Authors of all ones profit, and not to do as many haue done, into whose writings I haue looked, for by comparing them to the auncient, I founde that they had translated many things word for word, and neuer named them truely: indeed it is a signe of a vile and ill mind or witte, rather to aduenture to be taken with theft, then to pay that which was lent him, although he know vsury will not be required. Therefore we will confesse all to be other mennes, and begin with the Catalogue of such Writers as he nameth, and hath already expressed; and because I know none but learned and studious men will looke after them, I will after his manner expresse them in the Latine, and saue the labour of translation: Adding thereunto such Authors as I haue inserted into this story, either English or Forraine: And whereas I haue taken many things out of those Writers named by him which he omitted, I will not derogate from his labour, but suffer them to go as they were; and therefore to begin with Conradus Ges∣ner, I will say of him, as was said by him of another: Nulla ferent tantum saecula futura v ∣rum, and the residue follow Alphabetically.

T HE Antalope, called in Latine Calopus, and of the Graeci∣ans Analopos or Aptolos: Of this Beast there is no mention made among the auncient Writers, except Suidas and the Epistle of Alexander vnto Aristotle, interpreted by Corneli∣us Nepotius. They are bred in India and Syria, The contrey of their abod and Breed. neere the Ri∣uer Euphrates, and delight much to drinke of the cold wa∣ter thereof: Their bodie is like the body of a Roe, and they haue hornes growing forth of the crowne of their head which are very long and sharpe; so that Alexander affir∣med they pierced through the sheeldes of his Souldiers, and fought with them very irefully: at which time his company slew as he trauelled to India, eight thousand, fiue hundred, and fifty; which great slaughter may be the occasi∣on why they are so rare and sildome seene to this day, by cause thereby the breeders and meanes of their continuance (which consisted in their multitude) were weakened and destroyed. Their hornes are great and made like a saw, and they with them can cut asun∣der the braunches of Osier, or small trees, whereby it commeth to passe that many times their necks are taken in the twists of the falling boughes, whereat the Beast with repi∣ning cry, bewrayeth himselfe to the Hunters, and so is taken. The vertues of this Beast are vnknowne, and therefore Suidas sayth an Antalope is but good in parte. OF THE APE. A N Ape called in Latine Simia, and sometimes Simim and Si∣miolus; Cycero. Claudian. Martial. Horace. of the Greeke word Simos (Viz:) signifieng, the flatnesse of the Nostrils, for so are an Apes: and called of the Haebrewes Koph, and plurally Kophin ; as is by S. Ie∣rom translated, 1 King. 10.22. From whence it may be pro∣bably coniectured, came the Latine words Cepi & Cephi, for Apes that haue tailes. Of the name Sometimes they are called of the Haebrewes Bogiah, and of the Chaldees Kophin. The Italians Samada Maionio, & Bertuccia, and a Munkey Gatto Maimone. The auncient Graecians Pithecos and the later Mimon, and Arkobizanes, by reason of his imitation. The Moores Bugia, the Spaniards Mona, or Ximio, the French Singe, the Germaines Aff, the Flemishe Simme or Schimmekell, the Il∣lirians Opieze, and generally they are held for a subtill, ironical, ridiculous and vnprofita∣ble Beast, The smal vse of apes. whose flesh is not good for meate as a sheepe, neither his backe for burthen as an Asses, nor yet commodious to keepe a house like a Dog, but of the Graecians termed Gelo∣topoion, made for laughter. Athanaeus. Anacharsis the Philosopher, being at a banquet wherein diuers iesters were brought in to make them merry, yet neuer laughed, among the residue, at length was brought in an Ape, Apes made for laughter. at the sight whereof hee laughed hartily; and being demaunded the cause why hee laughed not before, aunswered; that men do but faine merriments, whereas Apes are natu∣rally made for that purpose. Moreouer Apes are much giuen to imitation and derision, and they are called Cercopes, Qualities of apes. because of their wicked crafts, deceipts, impostures and flatte∣ries: wherefore of the Poets it is fained that there were two bretheren most wicked fel∣lowes, that were turned into Apes, and from their seate or habitation came the Pithecusan Islands, which Virgill calleth Inarime : for Arime was an old Hetrurian word for an Ape, and those Islands being the seates of the Varinus, Docibility of apes. Gyants (who being by God ouerthrowen for their wickednes) in derision of them Apes were planted in their roomes. Apes haue beene taught to leape, singe, driue Wagons, raigning and whipping the Horses very artificially, and are very capable of all humaine actions, hauing an excellent memory either to shew loue to his friends, or hatefull reuenge to them that haue harmed him, but the saying is good that the threatning of a flatterer, and the anger of an Ape are both alike regarded. Hurts recei∣ued by apes. It delighteth much in the company of dogs and young Children, yet it will strangle young Children if they be not well looked vnto. A certaine Ape seeing a Woman washing her Child in a basen of warme water obserued her diligently, An History. and getting into the house when the Nurse was gone, tooke the childe out of the Cradle, and setting water on the fire, when it was hot, stripped the Childe naked, and washed the childe therewith vntill it killed it. The countries where Apes are found, are Lybia and all that desart Woods betwixt Egypt, Aethiopia and Libia ; and that parte of Caucasus which reacheth to the red Sea. Countries breeding Apes. In India they are most aboundant, both Redde, blacke, greene, dust-colour, and white ones, which they vse to bring into Citties (except Red ones, who are so venereous that they will rauish their Women) and present to their Kings, which grow so tame, that they go vp and downe the streetes so boldly and ciuilly as if they were Children, Booke of Voyages. frequenting the Mar∣ket places without any offence: whereof so many shewed themselues to Alexander stan∣ding vpright, that he deemed them at first to be an Army of enemies, and commaunded to ioyne battell with them, vntill he was certified by Taxilus a King of that Countrey then in his Campe, they were but Apes. In Caucasus there are trees of Pepper and Spices whereof Apes are the gatherers, Labour of Apes. liuing among those trees: for the Inhabitants come and vnder the trees make plaine a plotte of ground, and afterward cast thereupon boughs and braunches of Pepper and other fruites, as it were carelesly; which the Apes secretly obseruing, in the night season they gather togi∣ther in great aboundance all the braunches loaden with Pepper, and lay them on heapes vppon that plot of ground, and so in the morning come the Indians and gather the Pepper from those boughes in great measure, reaping no small aduantage by the labor of Apes, who gather their fruites for them whiles they sleepe: for which cause they loue them and de∣fend them from Lyons, dogges, and other wilde Beasts. In the region of Basman subiect to the great Cham of Tartaria, are many and diuers sorts of Apes, very like mankinde, which when the Hunters take, they pull off their haires al but the beard and the hole behinde, and afterward dry them with hot spices, and poudering them, sell them to Marchants, who car∣ry them about the world, preswading simple people that there are men in Islands of no grea∣ter stature. To conclude, Diuersity of apes. there are Apes in Trogloditae which are maned about the necke like Lyons, as big as great Bel-weathers. So are there some called Cercopitheci, Munkyes, Choeropitheci, Hog-Apes, Cepi, Callitriches, Marmosits, Cynocephali, of a Dog and an Ape, Satyres, and Sphinges, of which we will speake in order for they are not all alike, but some re∣semble men one way, and some another: Chymaera. as for a Chymaera which Albertus maketh an Ape it is but a figment of the Poets. The same man maketh Pigmaees a kinde of Apes, and not men, but Niphus proueth that they are not men bycause they haue no perfect vse of reason, lib. 7.1. de animal. no modesty, no honesty, nor iustice of gouernment, and although they speake yet is their language imperfect; and aboue all they cannot bee men because they haue no Religion, Pygmaeys. which ( Plato saith truely) is propper to euery man. Besides, their stature being not past three foure, or fiue spans long, their life not aboue eight yeares, and their imitation of man, do plainely proue them rather to be Apes then men: and also the flatnesse of their Noses, Onesicritus. their Combats with Cranes & Partridges for their egges and other circumstances I wil not stand vpon, but follow the description of Apes in general. Apes do outwardly resemble men very much, and Vesalius sheweth, that their proportion differeth from mans in moe things then Galen obserued, as in the muscles of the breast, & those that moue the armes, The anato∣my of apes. the elbow and the Ham, likewise in the inward frame of the hande, in the muscles mouing the toes of the feete & the feete and shoulders, & in the instrument mouing in the sole of the foote, also in the fundament & mesentary, the lap of the liuer, & the hollow vain holding it vp, which mē haue not; yet in their face nostrils, eares, eye-lids, breasts, armes, thumbes, fingers & nailes, they agree very much. Their haire is very harsh & short, and therfore hairy in the vpper part like men, and in the neather part like Beasts: they haue teeth before and behinde like mē, ha∣uing a round face, and ey-lids aboue and beneath, which other Quadrupedes haue not. Poli∣tianus saith that the face of a Bull or Lyon is more comely then the face of an Ape, which is liker a mans. They haue two Dugs, their breasts & armes like men, but rougher, such as they vse to bend as a man doth his foote. So their hands, fingers and nails, are like a mans but ru∣der and nimbler, and nature hauing placed their Dugs in their breast, gaue them armes to lifte their young ones vp to sucke them: Their feete are propper and not like mans, hauing the middle one longest, for they are like great handes, and consist of fingers like handes, but they are alike in bignesse, except that which is least to a man is greatest to an Ape, whose sole is like the hand but that it is longer, and in the hinder part it is more fleshie, somewhat resembling a heele, but put backward it is like a fist. They vse their feete both for going and handling; the neather parts of their armes, and their thighes are shorter then the proportion of their elbowes and shins: they haue no Na∣uel, but ther is a hard thing in that place; the vpper part of their body is far greater then the neather, like other Quadrupedes, consisting of A porportion betweene fiue and three : by rea∣son whereof they grow out of kinde, hauing feete like hands and feete. They liue more downeward then vpward, like other foure footed Beasts, and they want Buttocks (al∣though Albertus saith they haue large ones) they haue no taile, like 2. legged creatures, or a very small signe thereof. The genitall or priuy place of the female is like a Wo∣mans, but the Males is like a dogges: their nourishment goeth more forward then back∣ward, like the best horses, and the Arabian Seraph, which are higher before then behinde, and that Ape whose meate goeth forward by reason of the heate of heart and Lyuer, is most like to a man, in standing vpright: their eyes are hollow, and that thing in men is accounted for a signe of a malitious minde, as little eies are a token of a base and abiect spirit. Men that haue low and flat Nostrils are Libidinous as Apes that attempt women, and hauing thicke lippes the vpper hanging ouer the neather, they are deemed fooles, like the lips of Asses and Apes. Albertus saith, he saw the heart of a Male Ape, hauing 2. tops of snarp ends, which I knowe not whether to terme a wonder or a Monster. An Ape and a Cat haue a small backe, and so hath a weake hearted man, a broad and strong back signifieth a valiant and magnanimous mind. The Apes nailes are halfe round, and when they are in copulation they bende their Elbowes before them, the sinewes of their hinder ioynts being turned cleane about, but with a man it is cleane otherwise. The vaines of their armes are no otherwise dissected then a mans, hauing a very small and ridiculous crooked thumbe, by reason of the Muscles which come out of the hinder part of the Leg into the middle of the Shinne, and the fore muscles drawing the leg backe∣ward, they cannot exactly stand vpright, and therefore they runne and stand, like a man that counterfaites a lame mans halting. The disposi∣tion of Apes And as the body of an Ape is Ridiculous, by reason of an indecent likenesse and imi∣tation of man, so is his soule or spirit; for they are kept only in rich mens houses to sport withall, being for that cause easily tamed, following euery action he seeth done, euen to his owne harme without discretion. A certaine Ape after a shipwracke swimming to land, An History. was seene by a Countreyman, and thinknig him to be a man in the water, gaue him his hand to saue him, yet in the meane time asked him what Countrey man he was, who answered, he was an Athenian : well, saide the man, dost thou know Piraeus (which was a port in Athens ) very well, Places of their abode. saide the Ape, and his wife, frends and children, where at the man being moued did what he could to drowne him. They keep for the most part in Caues and hollow places of hils, in rocks and trees, feeding vpon Apples and Nuts, but if they finde any bitternesse in the shel, they cast all away. They eate Life and picke them out of heads and garments. Food of apes. They will drinke wine till they be drunk, but if they drink it oft they grow not great, specialy they lose their nails as other Quadrupedes do. They are best contented to sitte aloft, although tied with chaines. They are taken by laying for them shoos and other things, for they which hunt them will anoint their eies with water in their presence, and so departing, leaue a pot of lime or Hony in stead of the water; The manner of taking Apes. which the Ape espying, commeth and anointeth her eies therewith, and so being not able to see, doeth the hunter take her. If they lay shooes they are leaden ones, to heauy for them to weare, wherein are made such deuises of Ginnes, that when once the Ape hath put them on, they cannot be gotten off without the help of man: So like∣wise for little Bags made like Breeches, wherewithall they are deceiued and taken. Procreation of apes. They bring forth young ones for the most part by twins, whereof they loue the one and hate the other; that which they loue they beare in their Armes, the other hangeth at the dams back, and for the most part she killeth that which she loueth, by pressing it to hard: afterward, she setteth her whole delight vpon the other. The Egyptians when they discribe a father leauing his inheritance to his sonne that he loueth not, picture an Ape with hir young one vpon her backe. The male and female abide with the young one, and if it want anything, the male with fist and irefull aspect punisheth the female. When the Moone is in the waine they are heauy and sorrowful, Secretes in their nature. which in that kinde haue tailes; but they leape and reioyce at the change: for as other Beasts so doe these, feare the defect of the starres and planets. They are full of dissimu∣lation, and imitation of man, they readiler folow the euill then the good they see. their imitati∣on. They are very fierce by nature, and yet tamed forget it, but still remaine subiect to madnesse. their loue. They loue Conies very tenderly, for in England an old Ape (scarse able to goe) did de∣fend tame Conies from the Weasell, as Sir Thomas Moore reported. th ir eere. They feare a shel fish and a snaile very greatly, as appeareth by this History. In Rome, a certaine Boy put a snaile in his hat and came to an Ape, who as he was ac∣customed, leapes vpon his shoulder and tooke off his hat to kil Life in his head, but espy∣ing the snaile, it was a wonder to see with what hast the Ape leaped from the Boyes shoulder, and in trembling manner looked backe to see if the snaile followed him: also when a snaile was tied to the one end of another Apes chaine, so that he could not chose but continually looke vpon it, one cannot imagine how the Ape was tormented there∣with, finding no meanes to get from it, cast vp whatsoeuer was in his stomaeke, and fell into a grieuous feuer till it was remoued from the snaile, an antiquity. and refreshed with Wine and water. Cardane reporteth that it was an ancient custome in former time when a parra∣cide was executed, he was (after he was whipped with bloody stripes) put into a sacke, with a liue Serpent, a dog, an Ape and a Cocke: by the Serpent was signified his ex∣treame malice to mankinde in killing his father, by the Ape that in the likenesse of man he was a Beast, by the dog how like a dog he spared none, no not his owne father, and by a cocke his hatefull pride, and then were they altogether hurld headlong into the Sea. That he might be deemed vnworthy of all the Elements of life, and other blessings of nature. A Lyon ruleth the beasts of the earth, and a Dolphin the beasts of the sea, when the Dol∣phin is in age and sicknes, she recouereth by eating a sea-ape: and so the Lyon by eating an ape of the earth, and therefore the Egiptians paint a Lyon eating an ape, to signifie, the medicin of apes. a sicke man curing himselfe. The hart of an ape sod and dried, whereof the weight of a groat drunk in a draught of stale Hunny, sod in water, called Mellicraton, strengthneth the heart, em∣boldneth it, and driueth away the pulse and pusillanimity thereof: sharpeneth ones vnder∣standing, and is soueraigne against the falling euill. THE MVNKEY. T He Munkey called in Greeke Cercopithecos, and so in Latine Cercopithe∣cus, Their names that is a tailed Ape▪ not to destinguish it from all other Apes, but from other vulgar and common Apes, for there be Apes with tayles be∣sides a Munkey, but not so often seene. It is thought of some that the Hebrew Zijm signifieth a Munkey, other Ochim. Esa. 13. Babell shalbe de∣stroyed, Munster. and the fearefull beasts Zijm shall lye there, and Ochim shall fill their houses. Which Ochim, Albertus. Generation of a munkey. is interpreted Munkeys, but not generally, wherfore there is an opinion that this kind of Ape is generated of a wilde-cat very like an Ape, and an Ape, hauing two blacke spottes on the cheekes, a long taile, and blacke at the end thereof, it is called of the I∣talians, Gatto maimone, of the French Marmot of Marmona : that is the Ape of a male, for Mona signifieth an Ape, of the Germans Meerkatz, that is the cat of the sea, of the Illiri∣ans Morska, Maris-mona. and Koozka, as for Mammonet, it is a beast lesse then an Ape; of the Celts it is called Abranas. Inclination of Munkeys. They are very sportful, and giuen to imitate the actions of men like apes, it being a question, whether dogs, Elephants, or Munkeys, haue the most vnderstan∣ding among Brutes, and as was said before, when the Moone wayneth, it is heauye and dull, Secretes of Munkeys nature. but in the new Moone, ioccond and pleasant. Betwixt the Mammonets and Apes is continuall warre, and the Mammonet being the weaker, yet the wiser and craftier crea∣ture, Contention. is much more couragious in fight then an ape. These Munkeys o all things most abhorre a crocodile, The feare of a Munkey. for at the sight of the skin a farre off, it hath bin seene how the fear∣full creature hath runne through fire and water, crying and trembling for the naturall dread thereof. Ioh. Leo. Affrican. The contrey of their abod and Breed. They are bred in the hils of constance, in the woods of Bugia and Mauritania. In Aethio∣pia, they haue blacke heads, haire like asses, and voices like to other. In India they report that the Munkeys will clime the most steepe and high rockes, and fling stones at them that prosecute to take them. When the king of Ioga in India for religion goeth on Pil∣grimage, he carrieth with him very many Munkeys. In like sort Munkeys are brought from the new found Lands, from calechut and Prasia : and not farre from Aden a cittie of Arabia is a most high hill, Hart of Mun¦keys. abounding in these beasts, who are a great hinderance to the poore vintagers of the countrey of calechut, for they will climbe into the high palm trees, and breaking the vessels set to receiue the Wine, poure forth that lickquor they finde in them: Their food. they will eat hearbes and graine, and ears of grasse, going togither in great flocks, whereof one euer watcheth at the vtmost bounds of their campe, that he may crye out when the husbandman commeth, and then al flying and leaping into the next trees escape away: the females carry their young ones about with them on their shoulders, and with that burden leape from tree to tree. There be of this kind of Munkeys two sorts, one greater the other lesser, Diuersities of Munkeys. as is accounted in England, and Munkeys are in like sort so diuided, that there be in all foure kinds differing in bignes, whereof the least is little bigger then a squirrell, and because of their marueilous and diuers mowings, mouings, voices, and gestures, the Englishmen call any man vsing such Histrionical actours a Munkey. The onely difference betwixt these and other Apes aforesaide, is their taile; Solinus. Their anato∣my and parts. they differ from men in their Nerues, in the ioynts of their loynes, and their processes, and they want the thirde muscle moouing the fingers of their handes. Mammonents are lesse then an Ape, V ss us. Mammonets. brown on the back, and white on the belly, hauing a long and hairy taile, his neck almost so big as his body, for which cause they are tied by the hips that they slip not collar. They haue a round head, a face like a man, but blacke and bald on the crowne, his nose in a reasonable distance from his mouth like a mans, and not continued like an Apes, his stones greenish blew like a Turkey stone. They are caught after the manner of Apes, and being tamed and taught, they conceiue and worke very admirable feats, and their skins pulled off them being dead are dressed for garments. The foolish Arabians dedicated Memnonius cercopithecus vnto heauen, and in all afflictions implored his aide. Festus. another kind There is one other kind of Mun∣keys, whose taile is onely hairy at the tip called corcolipis. THE CEPVS OR Martine Munkey. THE Martine called cepus of the Greeke worde, The names. Kepos which Aristotle writeth Kebos, and some translate Caebus, some Cephus or Cepphus or more barbarously celphus, the la∣tines sometimes Ortus, Diodorus. Siculus. for indeede this kinde of ape in his best estate is like * a garden set with diuers flo∣wers, and therefore the best kinde of them is discerned and known by the sweetest sauour, such being alwayes the most ingenious imita∣tors of men. It is very pro∣bable that this name cepus is deriued of the Haebrewe Koph and Kophin signifying apes in general, as is before said, but yet this kind is de∣stinguished from other by strabo, Aelianus, and Pliny: although Aristotle doeth make no difference betwixt this and another ordinarie Munkey. The games of great Pompey first of all brought these Martines to the sight of the Ro∣maines, and afterward Rome saw no more, Pliny. The first knowledg of M rtins. they are the same which are brought out of Aethiopia, and the farthest Arabia, their feet and knees being like a mans, and their fore∣feet like hands, their inward parts like a mans, so that some haue doubted what kinde of creature this should be, which is in part a man, and yet a Foure-footed beast: it hauing a face like a Lyon, Their coun∣try of breed. Strabo. and some part of the body like a Panther, being as big as a wilde goate or Roe-bucke, or as one of the dogs of Erithrea, and a long taile, the which such of them as haue tasted flesh will eat from their owne bodies. Their anato∣my. Strabo. Scaliger. Concerning their coulor, howso∣euer they are not all alike, for some are blacke with white spots, hauing a greater voyce then others, some yellow, some Lyon-tauny, some golden yellow, and some cole-black: yet for the most part, the head and backe parts to the taile, are of a fiery color, with some golden hair aspersed among the residue, Their color. a white snowt, and certain golden strakes like a collar going about the necke, the inferior parts of the necke downe to the brest and the forefeet are white, Aelianus. their two dugs as big as a mans hand can gripe, are of a blewish cou∣lor, and their belly white, their hinder legs blacke, and the shape of their snowt like a Cy∣nocephale, which may be the difference betwixt Aelianus and Strabo, their cepus, and Ari∣stotles Cebus, for nature many times bringeth forth like beasts which are not of the same kind. Cay. In England there was a Martine that had his backe and sides of a green coulor, ha∣uing heere and their white haire, the belly chin and beard (which was round) white, the face and shins blacke, and the nose white, being of the lesser kind, for in bignes it excee∣ded not a coney. Their dispo∣sition. Some of them in Aethiopia haue a face like a Satyre, and other mem∣bers, in part resembling a Beare, and in part a Dog, so are the Prasian Apes. This Mar∣tine did the Babilonians, inhabiting neere Memphis, for the strangenes, the coulor, and shape thereof, worship for a God. They are of euill disposition like Apes, and therefore we will spare both their pictures and further description, finding very little of them in Histories worth commemoration. The Ape CALITRICH. THE Calitrich so cal∣led by reason of his bearde, the name. and may bee termed in English a bear∣ded Ape, Pliny. Countrey of breed. will liue no other where then in Ethiopia and India, which are easie to take, but verye harde to bring away aliue into these countryes. their partes and coulor. They differ in appearance from all other Apes, hauing a long beard and a large taile, hairye at the ende, being in India all white, Albertus. which the Indians hunt with darts, and being tamed, they are so apte to playe, Erasmus. that a man woulde think they were created for no other purpose, where∣uppon the Graecians vse in prouerbe, an ape hauinge a beard, for a ridiculous and foolish iesting man. Of the Prasyan Apes. MEgasthenes (saith Ae∣lianus and Strabo ) writeth of Apes in Prasia a Region in India, Their resem∣blance. which are noe lesse then great Dogges, and fiue cu∣bits high, hauing hayr like a man comming foorth of their forhead, and beardes, being altogither white ex∣cept their tayles, which are two cubits and a halfe long very like a Lyons; and vn∣to a simple man it myght seeme, that their tuftes of hayre were artificially tri∣med, though it grow natu∣rally. Their beard is much like vnto a Satyres, and al∣though their body be whit, yet is their head and tip of their taile yellowe, so that the Martines before menti∣oned, seeme to be affianced to these. Aelianus. Place of their abode. These Prasyan apes liue in Mountaines & Woodes, and yet are they not wilde, but so tame that oftentimes in great multitudes they come downe to the Gates and suburbs of Latagis, where the King commaundeth them daily sodden Rice for their food, which they eate, Their food. and being filled returne againe to their home and vsuall places of harbour in great mo∣deration, doing no harme to any thing. Peter Martyr telleth this story of one of these, that he being like to a great Munkey, Lib. 9. Oceanae Decad. 3. but hauing a longertayle, by rowling ouer and ouer three or foure times togither taketh such strength, that he leapeth from bough to bough, and tree to tree, as if he flewe. An archer of that Sea-voyage hurt one of them with an arrowe, the wounded Beast presently leapeth to the ground and setteth vpon the archer, as fiercely as a mad Dogge; Pet. Martyr. he drewe his sworde and strucke off one of his armes, and so at last with much adoo tooke the maimed beast, who being brought to the Navy, and accustomed to the society of men, began by litle and little to waxe tame. While he was in the ship bounde with chaines, o∣ther of the company hauing beene on land to for∣rage, brought out of the Marishes a Bore, which Bore was shewed to the Munkey; at the first sight either of other set vppe their bristles, The hatred of these apes. the raging Munkey leapeth vpon the Bore, and windeth his tayle round about the Bore, & with the one arme which he had left, caught him, and helde him so fast by the throte, that he stifled him. There is another kind of Munkey, for stature, bignesse and shape like a man, for by his knees, secret parts, and face, you would iudge him a wilde man, such as inhabit Nu∣midia, His loue and the Lapones, for he is altogither ouergrowne with haire; no creature except a man can stand so long as he, he loueth women and children dearly, like other of his own kind, and is so venereous, that he will attempt to rauish women, whose Image is in the former Page described, as it was taken foorth of the booke of the description of the holy Land. Of the Cynocephale or Baboun. C Ynocephales, are a kind of Apes, whose heads are like Dogges, and their other part like a mans; wherefore Gaza translateth them Ca∣nicipites, (to wit) Dog-heads. In the French, German, and Illyrian tongues, they are called of some Babion, and Babuino in Italian, is a small kinde of Ape: Aristotle. Pliny. but Aristotle saith, that a Cynocephale is bigger then an Ape: Description. In English they are called Babouns. There are many kinds of Baboons, whereof some are much giuen to fishing, Arrianus. so that they will tarry a whole day in the deepe hunting for fish, and at length come foorth with a great multitude. Againe, there are some which abhorre fishes, (as Orus saith) which kind, Prester Iohn ad Rom. pontif the Egiptians Emblematically vse to paint, when they wil deci∣pher a Sacrifice. Some there are which are able to write, and naturally to discerne Let∣ters; The industry of Babouns. which kind the old Egyptian Priests bring into their Temples, and at their first en∣trance, the Priest bringeth him a writing Table, a pensil and inke, that so by seeing him write, he may make try all whether he be of the right kind, and the beast quickly sheweth his skill: wherefore in auncient time, they were dedicated to Mercury, the fained god of learning. Orus. a secret in their nature. The reason why the Egyptians doe nourish them among their hallowed thinges is, that by them they may know the time of the coniuction betwixt the Sunne and Moone; because the nature of this Beast is, to haue a kind of feeling of that coniunction, for after that these two signs meet, the male Baboun neither will looke vp or eat, but cast his eies to the ground, as it were lamenting the rauishment of the Moone with disdainefull pas∣sion: In like maner the female who moreouer, at that time sendeth foorth blood out of her wombe of conception, whereupon the Aegiptians signifie by a Baboun the Moone, the rising of the Moon, by his standing vpright holding his hands vp toward heauen, and wearing a crowne on his head, because with such gestures doth that Beast congratulate her first appearance. Another cause why they bring them into their Temples is, because of the holynesse of circumcision, Circumcision natural in Ba¦bouns. for it is most true (though strange) that they are brought forth circum∣cised, at the least wise in some appearance; whereunto the Priestes giue great heede to accomplish and finish the work begun. The Aegiptians also paint a Baboun sitting, Orus. to sig∣nifie the Equinoctium, for in euery Equinoctium they barke or howle twelue times in one day, and so many times make water: Another secret. wherefore the Aegyptians also vpon their Hydrolo∣gies or Conduits did graue a Baboon, out of whose yard or priuy part yssued forth water; and they also say, that this Beast so norished among their holy things, dyeth not at once like other Beasts, but euery day one part by the space of 72. dayes (the other partes re∣maining in perfection of nature) which the priestes take and put in the earth day by day, A Wonder till all perish and be consumed. Orus. The West region of Lybia and Aethiopia haue great store of Cynocephals, Baboons, and Acephals, beasts without a head, whose eies and mouth are in their breasts. Herodotus. The contrey of their abod and Breed. Strabo. In like sort in Arabia, from Dira Southward in a promontorie, there are many Baboons, and in the con∣tinent called Dachinabades beyond Barygaza, and the Easterne Mountaines of the Medi∣terranean region; and those which Apollonius saw betwixt the riuers Ganges, and Hyphasis, seeme to be of this sort, in that he describeth them to be blacke haird, Dog-faced, Arrianus and like little men: wherewithall Aelianus seemeth to be deceiued, in saying, that there are men Cynoprosopoi, Dog-faced, whereas it is the error of vulgar people, to thinke that babouns are men, differing onely in the face or visage. Concerning their members or parts in seueral, they are black and hairy, rough skinned, Their anato∣my and parts. Albertus. red and bright eyes, along Dogges face, and teeth stronger and longer then Dogges: the face of a Lyon must not be attributed to this beast, nor yet a Satyres, though it bee more like. It hath a grim and fearefull face, and the female hath naturally her wombe cast out of her body, and so she beareth it about all her life long: their voyce is a shrill whizing, for they cannot speak, & yet they vnderstand the Indian language, Their voyce. Aelianus. vnder their beard they haue a chin growing like a Serpents, and bearding about the lips like a Dra∣gon; their hands are armed with most stronge nailes, and sharpe, they are very swift of foot, and hard to be taken, wherefore they wil run to the waters when they are hunted, being not ignorant that among waters they are most hardly taken, they are very fierce and actiue in leaping, biting deep and eagerly where they lay hold, neither do they euer growe so tame, but that they remaine furious also. They loue and nourish sheepe and Goates, and drinke their milk, they know how to take the kernels out of Almonds, Their loue and food Wal∣nuts and Nuts, as well as men, finding the meat within, though the shel be vnprofitable: they will also drinke wine and eat flesh, sod, rosted, or deliciously dressed, Their actiui∣ty in swim∣ming. and they will eat Venison, which they by reason of their swiftnes take easily, and hauing taken it teare it in peeces and rost it in the Sun, they can swim safely ouer any waters, and therefore a∣mong he Aegiptians they signifie swimming. tThey are euill manered and natured, wherfore also they are picturd to signifie wrath, Their nature in perticular. they are so vnapeasable. The Latins vse them adiectiuely to signifie any angry, stubborn, Their loue of garments. froward, or rauening man. They will imitate all humaine actions, louing wonderfully to weare garments, and of their owne accord they cloth themselues in the skinnes of wilde beasts they haue killed, they are as lustfull and venereous as goats, attempting to defile all sorts of women, and yet they loue little children, and their females will suffer them to sucke their brests if they be held to them, and some say they will sucke womens brests like little children. There was such a beast brought to the French king, his heade being like a Dogs, and his other parts like a mans, hauing legs, hands and Armes naked like a mans, and a white necke, he did eate sodde flesh so mannerly and modestly, An History. lib. de naturae rerum. taking his meat in his hands, and putting it to his mouth, that any man woulde thinke he had vn∣derstood human conditions: he stood vpright like a man, and sate downe like a man. He discerned men and women asunder, and aboue all loued the companie of women, and young maidens; his genitall member was greater then might match the quantity of his other parts: he being moued to wrath, would rage and set vpon men, but being pacifi∣ed, behaued himselfe as meekly and gently as a man, and was ouercome with fair words: shewing himselfe well pleased with those that sport with him. The Nomades, people of Aethiopia, and the nations of Menitimori liue vpon the milke of Cynocephals, keeping great heards of them, & killing all the males, except some few preserued for procreation. A TARTARINE. THere was at Paris another beast called a Tartarine, and in some places a Magot (much like a Baboun, Theod. Beza. as appeareth by his naturall circumcision) beeing as great as a Grey-hound, & walked for the most part on two legs, being clothed with a souldiors coat, and a sword girded to his side, so that the most parte thought him to be some Monster-little-man, for being commaunded to his kennell, he would go and tarry there all night, and in the day time walke abroade to be seene of euery man, it was doubtfull whether he wer of the Munkey kind or the Baboon, his voice was like the squeeking of a Mouse, but his aspect and counte∣nance was fierce, truculent, and fear∣full, as his image is heere deciphe∣red. THE SATYRE. A S the Cynocephall or Baboun -Apes haue giuen occasion to some to imagine (though falsly) there were such men, so the Satyres a most rare and seldome seene beast, Superstitious errour of Sa∣tyres. hath oc∣casioned other to thinke it was a Deuil; and the Poets with their Apes, the Painters, Limmers, and Caruers, to en∣crease that superstition, haue therefore described him with hornes on his head, and feet like Goates, whereas Satires haue neither of both. And it may be that Deuils haue at some time appeared to men in this likenes, as they haue done in the likenes of the Onocentaure and wilde Asse, and other snapes, it being also probable, that Deuils take not any daenomination or shape from Satyres, but rather the Apes themselues from Deuils whome they resemble, for there are many things common to the Satyre-apes and deuilish Satyres, as their human shape, their abode in solitary places, their rough-hayre, and lust to women, wherewith∣all other Apes are naturally infected: but especially Satyres. Wherefore the auncient Graecians coniecture their name to be deriued as it were of Stathes, signifying the yarde or virile member: Their name. and it is certain that the deuils haue excercised their praestigious lust, or rather their imagination of lust vpon mankind, whereof commeth that distinction of Fauni, that some are Incubi defilers of Women, and some Succubi defiled by men. Per∣aduenture the name of Satire is more fitly deriued from the hebrew Sair. Esa. 34. wher∣of of the plurall is Jeirim, Esa. 13. which is interpreted monsters of the Desart, or rough hairy Fawnes; and when issim is put to seir, it signifieth Goats. The Chaldaeans for seirim, render schedin ; that is, euill deuills: and the Arabians leseja∣thin, that is satanas : the Persyans Deuan, the Illyryans Deuadai and Dewas : the Germans Tenfel. They which passed through the world and exercised dauncing and other sports for Dionisius, were called Satyres, and sometimes Tytiri, because of their wanton songes; sometimes Sileni (although the difference is, that the smaller and younger beasts are called Satiri, the elder and greater Sileni :) Also Bacchae and Nymphae, where∣fore Bacchus is pictured ri∣ding in a chariot of Vine∣branches, Silenus ridinge beside him on an Asse; Gyraldin. and the Bacchae or Satyres sha∣king togither their staulkie Iauelines and Paulmers. By reason of their leaping they are caled Scirti, and the an∣ticke or satyricall dauncing sicinnis, and they also som∣times sicinnistae ; somtimes Aegipanae : wherefore Pliny reporteth, Grapaldin that among the westerne Ethiopians, there are certaine little hilles full of the Satirique Aegipanae, and that in the night time they vse great fires, piping and dansing, with a wonder full noise of Tymbrels and cymbals: and so also in At∣las amongest the Moores, whereof there was no footing, remnant, or appearance to be found in the day time. The Satyres are in the Islands Satiridae, which are three in number, Ptol: 2, 7. Countries of breed. standing right ouer against India on the farther side of Ganges ; of which Euphemus Car rehearseth this histo∣ry: that when he sayled into Italy, by the rage of winde and euill weather they were dri∣uen to a coast vnnauigable, where were many desart Islandes inhabited of wilde men, and the Marriners refused to land vpon some Islands, hauing heretofore had triall of the in humaine and vnciuill behauiour of the inhabitants; so that they brought vs to the sa∣tirian Islands, where we saw the inhabitants red, and had tayles ioyned to their back not much lesse then horsses. These, being perceiued by the Marriners to run to the shippes and lay hold on the women that were in them, the ship-men for feare, Their lustfull disposition. tooke one of the Barbarian women and set her on the land among them, whom in most odious and filthy maner they abused, not onely in that part that nature hath ordained, but ouer the whole body most libidinously, whereby they found them to be very bruit beasts. There are also Satires in the Eastern mountaines of India, Pliny in the country of the Carta∣duli, and in the prouince of the Comari and corudae, but the Cebi spoken of before bred in Ethiopia, are not Satyres (though faced like them:) nor the Prasyan Apes, Paul. venet. which resem∣ble Satyres in short beards. There are many kindes of these Satyres better distingui∣shed by names then any properties naturall known vnto vs. Diuersitie of kindes. Such are the Aegipenae befor declared, Nymphes of the Poets, Fawnes, pan & sileni, which in time of the Gentiles were worshipped for gods; and it was one part of their religion, Pliny to set vp the picture of a Sa∣tyre at their dores and gates, for a remedy against the bewitching of enuious persons; & the statuë of Priapus in the agalma of a Satyre in their gardens: for which cause, we read of many pictures made of Satyres. Pliny. Antiphilus made a very noble one in a Panthers skin, calling it Aposcopon, that is, Wri-faced. Another Painter of Aristides, painted it crowned with a drinking cup, signifiyng therby the beastlines of drunkards. Miron had one pain∣ted hearing and admiring pipes, Hermolaus. and another called Periboetos at Athens, as is reported, and that Praxitelus was wonderfully in loue therewith; wherupon beeing at supper with Phryne the noble harlot, who had begged of him the best piece of worke he had, consen∣ted, with this condition, that he would not tell hir which he loued best: wherupon shee, to satisfie hirselfe, priuily suborned one of his slaues, to come in at supper time, and tell him his house and most of his goods were burned, whereat being amazed, demanded if Cupid and the Satyre were safe, by which she knew the best peece, and asked cupid, refu∣sing the Satyre. Pliny. Protogenes had one painted holding pipes in his hande, and was called Anopauomenos: and Timanthes had painted cyclops sleeping in a little tablet, with Satyres standing beside him, measuring with a iauelyn the length of his thumbe. Satyres haue no humain conditions in them, nor other resemblance of men beside their outward shape: Mela. Resemblance of Satyres. though Solinus speake of them like as of men. They cary their meat vnder their chin as in a store-house, and from thence being hungry they take it forth to eate, making it ordinary with them euery day which is but annuall in the Formicae lions; being of very vnquiet motions aboue other Apes. Their proui∣sion of food. They are hardly taken, except sicke, great with yong, old, or asleepe: for Sylla had a Satyre brought him which was taken a sleepe neere Apollonia, Their tak ng in the holy place Nymphaeum, of whom he (by diuers interpreters) demanded many questions, but receiued no answer, saue only a voice much like the nei∣yng of a horse, wherof he being afraid, sent him away aliue. Philostratus teleth another hi∣story, how that Apollonius and his colleagues supping in a village of Ethiopia, beyond the fall of Nilus, they heard a sudden outcry of women calling to one another; some saying, Take him, others, Follow him : likewise prouoking their husbands to helpe them: the men presently tooke clubs, stones, or what came first to hand, complaining of an iniury don vnto their wiues. Now some ten moneths before there had appeared a fearfull snew of a Satyre, raging vpon their women, and had slain two of them, with whom he was in lou: the companions of Apollonius quaked at the hearing hereof, and Nilus one of them sware (by loue ) that they being naked and vnarmed, could not be able to resist him in his out∣ragious lust, but that he would accomplish his wantonnes as before: yet said Apollonius, there is a remedy to quaile these wanton-leaping beasts, which men say Midas vsed (for Midas was of kindred to Satyres, Taming of Satyres as appeared by his eares.) This Midas heard his mother say, that Satyres loued to be drunke with wine, and then sleep soundly, and after that be so moderat, mild and gentle, that a man would thinke they had lost their first nature. Whervpon he put wine into a fountain neere the high-way, whereof when the Satyr had tasted he waxed meeke suddenly, and was ouercome. Now, that we thinke not this a fable (saith Apollonius ) let vs go to the gouernor of the Towne, and inquire of him whe∣ther there be any wine to be had that we may offer it to the Satyre, wherunto all consen∣ted, & they filled foure great Egyptian earthen vessels with wine and put it into the foun∣tain where their cattel were watred: this don, Apollonius called the Satyre, secretly thret∣ning him, and the Satyre inraged with the sauour of the wine came; after he had drunk thereof, Now said Apollonius, let vs sacrifice to the Satyre for he sleepeth, and so led the inhabitants to the dens of the Nymphes, distant a furlong from the towne and shewed thē the Satyre, saying; Neither beat, cursse, or prouoke him henceforth, and he shall neuer harme you. It is certaine, that the deuils do many waies delude men in the likenes of Sa∣tyres, Pausanias. Macrobius. for when the drunken feasts of Bacchus were yearely celebrated in Parnassus, there were many sightes of Satyres, and voyces, and sounding of cymbals heard: yet is it like∣ly that there are men also like Satyres inhabiting in some desart places; for S. Ierom in the life of Paul the Eremite, reporteth there appeared to S. Antony an Hippocentaure, such as the Poets describe and presently he saw in a rocky valley adioining, Men like Sa∣tyres a litle man hauing croked nostrils, hornes growing out of his forhed, and the neather part of his body had Goats feet: the holy man not dismayed, taking the shield of faith, and the breast-plate of righteousnesse, like a good souldior of Christ, preased toward him, which brought him some fruites of palmes as pledges of his peace, vpon which he fed in the iourney; which saint Anthony perceiuing, he asked him who he was, and receiued, this answere; I am a mortall creature, one of the inhabitants of this Desart, whome the Gentiles (de∣ceiued with error) doe worship and call Fauni, Satyres, and Incubi : I am come in ambas∣sage from our flocke, intreating that thou wouldst pray for vs vnto the common GOD, who came to saue the world: the which words were no sooner ended, but he ran away as fast as any foule could fly. And least this should seeme false, vnder Constantine at A∣lexandria, there was such a man to be seene aliue, and was a publike spectacle to all the World, the carcasse whereof after his death was kept from corruption by heat, through salt, and was caried to ANTIOCHIA that the Emperor himselfe might see it. Satyres are very sildome seene, and taken with great difficulty, as is before saide: Albertus. Two b aste like Satyres taken. for there were two of those founde in the woods of Saxony towards Dacia, in a desart, the female whereof was killed by the darts of the hunters, and the biting of Dogs, but the male was taken aliue, being in the vpper parts like a man, and in the neather partes like a Goat, but all hairy throughout: he was brought to be tame, and learned to go vpright, and also to speake some wordes, but with a voice like a Goat, and without all reason: he was exceeding lustfull to women attempting to rauish many of what condition soeuer they were, and of this kinde there are store in Ethiopia. THE FIGVRE OF ANOTHER MONSTER. T HE famous learned man George Fabricius, Another monster like a Satyre. shewed me this shape of a monstrous beast that is fit to be ioyned to the sto∣ry of Satyres. There was (saide he) in the territory of the Bishop of Salceburgh, in a forrest called Fannesbergh, a cer∣taine foure-footed beast, of a yellowish-carnation colour, Colour and nature. but so wilde that he would neuer be drawne to looke vppon any man, hiding himselfe in the darkest places, and beeing watched diligently, would not be prouoked to come forth so much as to eate his meate, so that in a very short time it was famished. The hinder legs were much vnlike the for∣mer, and also much longer. It was taken about the year of the Lord, one thousand, fiue hundred thirty, whose image being here so liuely described, may saue vs further labour in discoursing of his maine and different parts and proportion. OF THE NORVEGIAN MONSTERS. Hoct. Boet. W Hen as certaine Ambassadors were sent from Iames the fourth of that name king of Scotland, among whom was Iames Ogill that famous scho∣ler of the Vniuersitie of Abberdon, they no sooner tooke shipping and hoysted sayle, but there sodainly arose such a tempestuous storme, that they were driuen to the coasts of Norway : and there going on shore, they were very strangely affrighted, to see (as to them it appeared) certaine wild, Monsters lik Men monstrous-men, running on the tops of the mountaines. Afterward, they were told by the inhabitants that they were beasts (and not men) which did beare mor∣tall hatred to mankind, although they could not abide the presence of a mans counte∣nance, Hatred to mankind yet in darke nights, when the reuerent visage of humaine creatures are couered, they will come downe by troopes vpon the villages, and except the barking of dogges driue them backe they breake open dores, and enter houses, killing and deuouring who soeuer they find; for their strength is so vnresistable and great, that they can pull vp by the rootes a tree of meane stature, The great strength of these beasts. and tearing the boughes from the bodye, with the stocke or stem thereof they fight one with another. Which when the Ambassad. heard, they caused a sure watch to be kept all night, and withall made exceeding great fires, and when the light appeared, they tooke their farwell of those Monster-breeding-shores, re∣couering with ioy, the course which before they had lost by tempest. Of the AEGOPITHECVS. Diuers shaps in apes. VNder the Equinocti∣all toward the East & south, there is a kind of Ape called Aegopithecus, an Ape like a Goate. For there are Apes like Beares, called Arctopitheci, & some like Lyons, called Leontope∣theci, The descrip∣tion of Pan. and some like Dogs, called Cynocephali, as is be∣fore expressed; and manye other which haue a mixt re∣semblance of other crea∣tures in their members. Amongst the rest is there a beast called PAN ; who in his head, face, horns, legs, and from the loynes down∣warde resembleth a Goat, but in his belly, breast, and armes, an Ape; such a one was sent by the king of Indi∣ans to Constantine, Nicephorus Calisthius which being shut vp in a Caue or close place, by reason of the wildnesse thereof, liued there but a season, & when it was dead and bowelled, they pouldred it with spi∣ces, and carried it to be seene at Constantinople: the which beast hauing beene seene of the auncient Graecians, were so amazed at the strangnesse thereof, that they receiued it for a god, as they did a Satyre and other strange beasts. OF THE SPHINGA Or SPHINX. T HE Sphinx or Sphinga is of the kinde of Apes, hauing his body rough like Apes, but his breast vp to his necke, Pliny. calisthius. The descrip∣tion. pilde and smooth without hayre: the face is very round yet sharp and piked, hauing the breasts of women, and their fauor or visage much like them: In that part of their body which is bare without haire, there is a certaine red thing rising in a round circle like Millet seed, which giueth great grace & comelinesse to their coulour, which in the middle parte is humaine: Their voice is very like a mans but not articulat, sounding as if one did speake hastily with indignation or so∣row. Their haire browne or swarthy coulour. They are bred in India and Ethyopia. Aelionus. Countrey of breed. In the promontory of the farthest Arabia neere Dira, are Sphinges and certaine Lyons cal∣led Formicae, so likewise they are to be found amongest the Trogladitae. lions-formic As the Babouns & Cynocephals are more wilde than other Apes, Pliny. so the Sa∣tyres and Sphynges are more meeke and gentle, for they are not so wilde that they will not bee tamed, Their nature nor yet so tame but they will reuenge their own harmes: Albertus. as appea∣red by that which was slayne in a publike spectacle among the Thebanes. They carrye their meat in the storehouses of their own chaps or cheeks, Manner of carrieng their meate. taking it forth when they are hungry, and so eat it: not be∣ing like the Formicae, for that which is annuall in them, is daily and hourely amongest these. The name of this Sphynx is taken from Hermolaus. binding, Of the name and notation thereof as ap∣peareth by the Greek notati∣on, or else of delicacie and dainty nice Ʋarrianus loosnesse, (wherefore there were certain common strumpets called Sphin∣ctae, and the Megarian Sphingas, was a very popular phrase for notorious harlots) hath giuen occasion to the Poets, to faigne a certaine monster called Sphynx, which they say was thus deriued. Hydra brought foorth the Chimaera, Chimaera by Orthus the Sphinx, and the Nemoean Lyon: now this Orthus was one of Geryons Dogges. Hesiod. This Sphinx they make a treble-formed monster, a Maydens face, a Lyons legs, and the wings of a fowle, Ausonius. The descrip∣tion of the Poets Phinx. or as Ausonius and Varinus say, the face and hand of a mayde, the body of a Dogge, the winges of a byrd, the voice of a man, the clawes of a Lyon, and the tayle of a Dragon: and that she kept continually in the Sphincian mountaine; propounding to all trauailers that came that way an Aenigma or Riddle, The Riddle of the Sphinx which was this: What was the creature that first of all goeth on foure legges; afterwards on two, and lastly on three: and all of them that could not dissolue that Riddle, she presently slew, by taking them and throwing them downe headlong, from the top of a Rocke. At last Oedipus came that way and declared the se∣cret, that it (was a Man) who in his infancy creepeth on al foure, afterward in youth, goeth vp∣right vpon tvvo legs, The solution of the Riddle by Oedipus and last of all in olde age taketh vnto him a staffe which maketh him to goe as it were on three legs ; which the monster hearing, she presently threwe downe her selfe from the former rocke, and so she ended. Wherevpon Oedipus is taken for a sub∣till and wise opener of mysteries. But the truth is, Palaephatus. The true Hi∣story of Sphinx that when Cadmus had married an Amazonian woman called Sphynx, and with her came to Thebes, and there slew Draco their King and possessed his kingdom, afterward there was a sister vnto Draco called Harmona, whom Cadmus married, Sphynx being yet aliue: She in reuenge (being assisted by many followers) departed with great store of wealth into the Mountaine SPHINCIVS, taking with her a great Dogge which Cadmus held in great account, and there made daily incursions or spoiles vpon his peo∣ple: Now aenigma in the Theban -language, signifieth an inrode or warlike incursion, wher¦fore the people complained in this sort. This Graecian Sphinx robbeth vs, in setting vp∣on with an aenigma, but no man knoweth after what manner she maketh this aenigma. Cadmus hereupon made proclamation, that he would giue a very bountifull rewarde vnto him, that would kill Sphinx, vpon which occasion the CORINTHIAN Oedipus came vnto her, being mounted on a swift courser, and accompanied with some Thebans in the night season, slue her. Other say, that Oedipus by counterfaiting friendshippe, slue her, making shew to be of her faction; and Pausanias saith, that the former Riddle, was not a Riddle, but an Oracle of Apollo, which cadmus had receiued, whereby his posteritie should be inheritors of the Theban kingdome; and whereas Oedipus, being the sonne of Laius a former king of that countrey, was taught the Oracle in his sleepe, he recouered the kingdome vsurped by Sphinx his sister, and afterward vnknowne, married his owne mother Iocasta. But the true morall of this poeticall fiction, is by that learned Alciatus in one of his emblems deciphered, that her monstrous treble-formed-shape, signified her lustfull pleasure vnder a Virgins face, her cruell pride vnder the Lyons clawes, her winde-driuen lenitye vnder the Eagles or birdes feathers, and I will conclude with the wordes of Suidas concerning such monsters, Suidas Meaning this Poeticall Sphinx that the Tritons, Sphinges, and centaures, are the images of those things, which are not to bee founde within the compasse of the wholeworld. The true Sphinx first described, is of a fierce though a tameable nature, and if a man doe first of all perceiue or discerne of these naturall Sphinges, before the beast discerne or perceiue the man, he shall be safe; but if the beast first descrie the man, then is it mor∣tall to the man. The nature of the Sphinx. These Sphinges were of great account for their strangenesse: with their image did Augustus signe all his grauntes, Sue onius. The vse of Sphinges. Herodotus. Pausanias. libels, and Epistles: afterward hee lefte that, and signed with the Image of Alexander the great, and last of all with his owne. Syclis the king in the citty of the Boristhenites, had a faire house, about which there were sphin∣ges and Gryphins wrought out of white stone. At Athens, in the Temple Parthenona, there is described the contention betwixt Pallas and Neptune, about the earth, and the image of Pallas made of Yuory and gold, hath in the midst of hir shield the picture of a sphinx. Amasis the king of Egypt, built in the porch of Pallas, an admirable worke called Sai : where he placed such great colosses and Andro-sphinges, that it was afterward supposed he was buried therein, Horodotus. and was liuely to be seene imputrible. To conclude, the Egyptians in the porches of their Temples painted a Sphinx, wherby they insinuated that their di∣uine wisdome was but darke and vncertain, and so couered with fables, that there scarce appeared in it any sparkles or footsteps of verity. Of the SAGOIN, called Galeopithecus. This figure of the Sagoin, I re∣ceiued of Peter cordenberg, a ve∣ry learned Apo∣thecary of Ant∣werpe, which is three times as big as my pictur and Iohn say that famous English Doctor hath aduertised me, that it no way resembleth the Sagoin it selfe, which is not much greater than a Rat, a little conny, The qualitie. or a young Hedg¦hog: for he had seene seuerall ones of that bignesse, of a gryseld colour, a neate beard, Colour and somewhat ash-coloured, a tayle like a Rat, but hayry; the feet of a Squirrell, the face almost like a Martine, or Satyre, a round eare but very short and open, Partes the hayre blacke at the root, and white at the end, and in other conditions like a Munkey. They are much set by among women, and by the Brasilians where they are bred and called Sagoines, it being very propable that they are conceiued by a small Ape and a Weasell, for in that countrey by reason of the heat thereof, there are many such vnnaturall commixtions. Procreation of Sagoines It is a nimble, liuely, and quicke spirited beast, but fearefull; it will eate white-bread, Their meate ap∣ples, sweet-grapes, dried in the sunne, figges, or peares. There was one of them at Ant∣werpe solde for fifty crownes: The price of a Sagoin in France they call a Sagoni a little beast not much bigger than a Squirrell, and not able to endure any cold. Some other affirme that a Sagoin is a bearded creature, but without a taile, of an ash-colour, not much bigger then a fiste, but of this beast there is not any author writeth more then is already rehearsed. OF THE BEAR-APE ARCTOPITHECVS. THere is in America a very de∣formed beast which the inhabi∣tants call Haut or Hauti, Theuetus. Of the name & the Frenchmen Guenon, as big as a great Affrican Monkey. His parts His belly hangeth very low, his head and face like vnto a childes, as may be seen by this liue∣ly picture, and being taken it wil sigh like a young childe. His skin is of an ash-colour, and hairie like a Beare: he hath but three clawes on a foot, as longe as foure fingers, and like the thornes of Priuet, whereby he clim∣beth vp into the highest trees, and for the most part liueth of the leaues of a certain tree being of an exceeding heigth, which the Americans call Amahut, and thereof this beast is called Haut. Their tayle is about three fingers long, hauing very little haire thereon, it hath beene often tried, that though it suffer any famine, it will not eate the fleshe of a liuing man, and one of them was giuen me by a French-man, which I kept aliue sixe and twenty daies, and at the last it was killed by Dogges, and in that time when I had set it a∣broad in the open ayre, I obserued, that although it often rained, A secret in Nature. yet was that beast ne∣uer wet. When it is tame it is very louing to a man, and desirous to climbe vppe to his shoulders, which those naked Amerycans cannot endure, by reason of the sharpenesse of his clawes. Of the Simivulpa, or Apish FOXE. THose which haue trauay led the con∣try of Payran doe affirme, Pisonius. Gillius. The descrip∣tion. that they haue seene a four-footed beast cal∣led in Latine Si∣mivulpa, in Greek Alopecopithecos, & in German Fuch∣ssaff : in the forpart like a Foxe, and in the hinder part like an Ape, except that it had mans feet and eares like a Bat, Description. and vnderneath the common belly, there was a skinne like a bagge or scrip, wher∣in she keepeth, lodgeth, and carrieth her young ones, vntill they are able to prouide for themselues, without the helpe of their damme: neyther do they come foorth of that re∣ceptacle, except it be to sucke milke, or sport themselues, so that the same vnderbelly is her best remedie against the furious Hunters and other rauening beasts, to preserue her young ones, for she is incredibly swift, running with that carriage as if she had no bur∣then. It hath a tayle like a Munkey: there was one of them with three young Whelpes taken, and brought into a ship, but the whelpes dyed quickly: the olde one liuing lon∣ger, was brought to Syuill, and afterward to Granado, where the King of Spaine sawe it, which soone after by reason of the change of ayre and incertainty of dyet, did also pyne away and die. The like things doeth Cardan report of a beast called Chiurca, in Hispania noua, and Stadinius of a Seruuoy in America: but I coniecture that the former is this Fox ape, Aelianus. called in Greeke Alopecopithecos, and of the Germans Fuschsaffe, the latter the Fe∣male Cynocephall, which carryeth her wombe wherin lye her young ones without hir bel∣ly. a miraculous thing of a fish There is a fish called Glaucus, whereof the male swalloweth vppe all the young ones when they are indangered by other, and afterward yeeldeth them forth againe safe and sound. OF THE ASSE. T He Asse is called in Latine Asinus, in Greeke Oros and Killos, by rea∣son of his labour in bearing burthens, and of some Megamucos be∣cause of his vnpleasant voyce: Of the name and the rea∣sons thereof. Of other Cochutons, or Canthon, from whence commeth Cantharus, that is, a Scarabee or Fl e, bred of the dung of Asses. The Haebrues call it Chamor, Deuteron. 5. and the Persyans Care, the latter Haebrues doe indifferently take Gajedor, Ʋarinus. Tartak, and caar for an Asse: the Italyans Lasino, the Spani∣ardes Asno, Epethites of in Asse. the French Vng asne, the Germans Esel, Mul, Mulle-re∣sel, and the Illyrians Osel ; the which beast is intituled or phrased with many epithites a∣mong Poets; as, slow, burthen-bearing, back-bearing, vile, cart-drawing, mill-labou∣ring, sluggish, crooked, vulgar, slow-paced, long-eared, blockish, braying, ydle, deuill-haired, filthy, saddle-bearer, slow-foot, four-foot, vnsauoury, and a beast of miserable condition; beside many other such titles in the Greeke. Yet this silly beast hath among the Astronomers found more fauour, for in the signe Cancer there are two starres called the two Asses, placed there as some say, by Bacchus, Pliny. Asses in coe∣lestial signes. Hyginus. who in his fury which Iuno laid vp∣on him, trauailing to the Dodanaean Temple of Apollo to recouer his wits, by the counsel of the Oracle, came to a certaine lake of water, ouer which he could not passe; and mee∣ting there two Asses, tooke one of them, vpon whose backe hee was safely carried ouer dri-foote. Afterward, when he had recouered his wits, in thankfulnesse for that good turne, he placed the two Asses among the starres. Howsoeuer this may be a fabulous commendation of this beast, Numb. 22 yet holy Writ tea∣cheth vs, that an Asse saw an Angell, and opened his mouth in reproofe of his mayster Balaam : and our most blessed Sauiour rode on an Asse to Ierusalem to shew his humility: and Sampson out of the iaw-bone of an Asse, quenched his thirst. Morals of the discourses of asses. Apuleius in his eleuen bookes of his golden Asse, taketh that beast for an Emblem, to note the manners of mankind; how some by youthfull pleasures become beasts, and afterward by timely re∣pentant old-age, are reformed men againe: Some are in their liues Wolues; Proclus. som Fox∣es, some Swine, some Asses, and so other may be compared to other beasts: and as Ori∣gen saith, onely by pleasure is a man a horse or Mule, when a beastly soule liueth in a hu∣maine shape. This world is vnto them an inchanted cup of Circes, Beroaldus wherein they drinke vp a potion of obliuion, error, and ignorance; afterwards brutizing in their whole life, till they tast the Roses of true science and grace inlightning their minds, which is theyr new recouery of humane wit, life, and vnderstanding. Asses are bred in Arcadia, wherefore prouerbially, Countries breeding asses. the best Asses are signified by the Arcadian Asse, and the greatest Asses by the Acharnican Asse. In Timochain of Persya, are very beautifull Asses, whereof one hath beene sold for thirty pounds of siluer. Paul vene ▪ Pondera: Likwise in Rea, in Italy, in Illiria, Thracia and Epirus, there are Asses but very small ones, although all other cattell there are very large. In India, among the Psillians, they are not greater then Rams, and generally all their cattell are of a very small growth. In Scythia, Pontus, Aelianus. Celta, and the regions confining them, are no Asses bred, by reason of extreamity of cold, for Asses are very impatient of cold. In Misia there are also asses, but their flankes are crooked and indented as if they were broken; whereupon a prouerbiall common speech ariseth (one hauing a broken flanke) for a Missian Asse. Asses are ingendred both by their owne kind and also by horses, for they choose stal∣lions and put them to their Asses, who haue large bodies, wel set legs, strong neckes, Their breed. broad and strong ribbes, brawny and high creasts, thighes full of sinewes, and of black or flea-bitten colour (for a Mouse-colour is not approued) wherefore he that will haue a good flocke of Asses, must looke that the male and female be sounde, and of a good age, that they may breed long time, and out of a good seminary, as of Arcadia or Rea: Palladius. for as the best Lampreyes are in Sicilia, and the delicate fish Helops, in Rhodos and not else where; so are best Asses in these forenamed places. When they make choise of a Stalli∣on, they looke principallie that he haue a great head: An asse is more desirous of copu∣lation then a horse, and both male and female doe couple at thirtie moneths, Absirtus. although it proue not, vntill three yeares, or three and a halfe. Aristotle Pliny. Men say that Anna the father in law of Esau, did first inuent the copulation of horses and Asses togither: for as a horsse doth couer a shee asse, so an asse will couer a Mare, and an asse will sooner fill the lust of a Mare, then a horsse. If a horsse couer a female asse which hath beene entred by a male asse, he cannot al∣ter the seed of the asse: but if an asse couer a Mare which a horsse formerly entred, Pliny he will destroy the seed of the horsse, so that the Mare shall suffer abortment, Leonicen by reason that the seed genitall of an Asse is more frigide then a horses: The Mares of Elis cannot at all conceiue by asses copulation, and there is more aborments falleth out by commix∣tion of horsses with asses, or asses with Mares, then when euery kind mingleth amongst themselues. It it but a superstition of some, Pliny Aristotle which affirme that an asse cannot conceiue for so many yeares, as she hath eaten graines of barly corne defiled with womens pur∣gation, but this is certaine, that if an asse conceiue not at the first loosing of hir teeth, she remayneth barren. They are not coupled in generation in the Spring aequinoctium like Mares and other beasts, but in the Sommer Solstice, by reason of their colde natures, that they may bring forth their yong ones about the same time, for in the twelfe month after their copulation, Aristotle Varro. they render their foles. If the males be kept from labour they are the worse for generation, wherefore they are not to be suffered ydle at that time, but it is not so with the female, she must rest, that the Fole may be the stronger: but presentlie after she is couered she must be coursed and driuen to and fro, or else she will cast forth againe the receiued seed. Pliny The time that she goeth with yong is according to the male kind by which shee is co∣uered, for so long as the male lay in the belly of his damme, so long will the Asse carrie her yong before deliuerance: but in the stature of body, strength, and beauty, the yong one taketh more after the female, then the male. The best kind of Asses are the foles of a wilde Asse and a tame female-Asse. They vse when an asse is foaled, to take it from the damme, and put it to sucke a Mare, that it may be the greater, which fole is called Hippo∣thela, Pliny that is, a Horse-suckling, and Mares will not be couered by Asses, except by such an one as was a horse-suckling. A she-asse will engender till she bee thirty yeares olde, which is her whole life long, Aelianus. but if she conceiue often, she will quickly be barren: wher∣of their keepers must take such care, that they cause them to be kept from often copu∣lation. They will not fole in the sight of man, or in the light, but in darknesse; they bringe forth but one at a time, for it hath not been heard of in the life of man, that an asse hath euer brought forth twinnes. Assoone as they are conceiued they haue milke in theyr vd∣ders, but some hold not vntill the tenth moneth. They loue their yong ones very ten∣derly, for they will run through fire to come at them, but if there be any water betwixt them, it cooleth their affections, for of all things they loue not to wet their feet. They will driue their young ones from sucking at the sixt moneth, because of the pain in their vdders, but their keepers weane them not till a whole yeare after their foaling. Their milke is so thicke that it is vsed in stead of sodder: a Mares is more thin, and a Camels is thinnest of all. It is mortall to their yong ones to tast the dammes milke for two dayes after their foling, for the food is so fat that it breedeth in their mouthes the colostracion or Beestings. Touching their seuerall parts, Aelianus. they haue teeth on either chap like a man and a horsse, an Asse and a Mule haue 36. teeth, and ioyned neere togither: the bloud of Asses and Bulles is the thickest of all other, Ab ertus. as the bloud of man is the thinnest: His head is great and his eares long and broad: both male and female loose their fore-teeth in the thirtith moneth of their age, Pliny. and the second to the first, in the sixt moneth, their third & fourth teeth are called Gnomons, that is, Regulars, because by them there is a tried rule to know their age; and those teeth also they lose in the sixt moneth. The hart of an Asse is great, as all other fearefull beasts haue: The belly is vniforme as in other beasts that haue a so∣lide or whole hoofe. It wanteth a gall, and hath two vdders betwixt the thighes, the for∣part of the backe neere the shoulders is weakest, and there appeareth the figure of a Crosse, Plutarch. Pliny. Ioan: A o∣ ach. and the hinder part neere the loynes is stronger. The hoofes are whole and not parted: the Stygean water is so cold that nothing can hold it, except the hoofe of an asse or Mule; although Aelianus affirme, that it cannot bee contained but in the hornes of Scythian asses. Their tayles are longer by one ioint then a horsses (though not so hairy.) They are purged with monthly courses more then sheepe or Goats, and the vrine of the female is more thin than the males. If an Asse was hindered by any disease from making water, certaine superstitious persons for the ease of the beast, muttered this charm: Gal∣lus bibit & non meijt, myoxus meijt & non bibit : that is, The Cocke drinketh and maketh not water, The Dormouse maketh water and neuer drinketh. They will eate Canes or Reedes, Their meate. which to other beasts is almost poison: wherefore in old time an Asse was dedicated to Bacchus as the canes wer sacred vnto him; and at the time of their copulation they giue them herbe Basill to stir vp their lust: They will be sa∣tisfied with any neuer so base food, as chaffe, whereof there is abundance in euery coun∣trey, young thornes and fruites of trees, twigges of Osier, Philemon died with lau¦ghing when he saw an asse eate figs. or a bundle of boughes to browse vpon: insomuch as Q. Hortensius was wont to say, that he had more care that his Barbels should not hunger in his fish-pools, then his Asses in Rosea : but the young ones newly weaned must be more tendered, for they must be fed with hay, chaffe or barley, Ʋal: Man: greene corne, or barley bran. Asses will hardly drinke but at watering places in their folds, or such as they haue been accustomed withall, and where they may drink without wetting their feet; and that which is more strange, they cannot be brought to goe ouer hollow bridges, through which the water appeareth in the chinks of the plankes, & when in trauaile they are very thirsty, they must be vnladen and constrained to drink: yea, He∣rodotus reporteth, that there are certaine Asses among the African shepheardes, which neuer drinke. When they sleepe they lie at length, and in their sleepe conceiue manie forceable dreames, as appeareth by the often beating backe their hinder legs, which if they strike not against the vaine ayre but against some harder substance, they are for euer vtterly lamed. When the Asses of Thuscia haue eaten Hemlocke, or an herbe much like vnto it, Mathaeolus. they sleepe so long and strangely, that oftentimes the countreymen begin to fleay them, and on the sudden their skins halfe taken off and the other halfe on, they awake, braying in such horrible maner, that the poore men are most dreadfully affrighted therwith. Their voice is very rude and fearefull, as the Poet said: Quirritat verres, tardus rudit, oncat assellus. and therefore the Graecians to expresse the same haue feigned many new wordes and cal it Ogkethmos, as the Latines Rudere, that is, to vtter forth a voice in a base and rude ma∣ner. The Poets feign, that at that time when Iupiter came to warre with the Gyantes, Eratosthenes Bac∣chus and Vulcan, the Satyres and Sileni assisted and attended him, being carried vpon As∣ses. When the time came that the battell began, the Asses for very feare brayed most horribly, whereat the Gyantes not being acquainted with such strange and vnknowne voyces and cries, tooke them to their heeles and so were ouercome. In the sacrifices of the Goddesse Vacuna, an Asse was feasted with bread, and crowned with flowers, hung with rich Iewels and Peytrels, Ouid. because (as they saye) when Priapus would haue rauished Vesta being asleepe, she was suddenly awaked by the braying of an Asse, and so escaped that infamie: And the Lampsaceni in the disgrace of Priapus did of∣fer him an asse. But this is accounted certaine, that among the Scythians by reason of colde, an Asse is neuer heard nor seene; and therefore when the Scythians set vppon the Persyans, their horsses will not abide the braying of Asses, Lanctantius. wondring both at the strang∣nesse of an Asses shape, and rudenesse of his crie: wherefore there are certaine birds, re∣sembling in their chattering the braying of Asses, and are therefore tearmed Onocra∣tuli. When an asse dieth, out of his body are ingendred certaine Flies, called Scarabees. They are infested with the same diseases that horsses be, and also cured by the same mea∣nes (except in letting of bloud) for by reason their vaines be small and their bodies cold, A good hors leach is a good asse∣leach. Vegetius. in no case must any bloud be taken from them. Asses are subiect to madnesse when they haue tasted of certaine herbes growing neer Potnias ; as are Beares, Horsses, Leopardes and Wolues: they only among al other hai∣rie beasts are not trobled with either tikes, or lice, but principally they perish by a swel∣ling about the crowne of their pasterne, or by a Catarhe called Malis, which falling down vpon their liuer they die, but if it purge out of their nostrils they shall be safe: and Colu∣mella writeth that if sheepe bee stabled where Mules or Asses haue beene housed, they will incur the scab: There is great vse made of the skins of Asses, for the Germans doe make thereof a substance to paint and write vpon, which is called Eselshut. The Arabians haue a cloth called Mesha, made of Asses and Goats haire, whereof the inhabitauntes of their deserts make them tents and fackes. It is reported that Empedocles was called Coly∣sanemas, because when the Agrigentines were trobled with winds by hanging about their cittie innumerable Asse-skins, he safe-guarded them from the windes: wherupon some haue thought (but falsly) that there was some secret in asses skinnes, against outragious Tempestes. P ny. The bones of Asses haue beene vsed for pipes, the Artificers make more reckoning of them then of the bones of Hartes, and therefore Esop in Plutarch wondereth that so grosse and dull a creature, should haue such shrill and musicall bones; and the Busirites called the Phylosophers Naucratites, because they played musick vpon Asses bones, for they cannot abide the sound of a trumpet, because it resembleth the voice of an Asse, who is very hatefull to them for Typhons sake. Macenas allowed the flesh of young Asses to be eaten, preferring it before the flesh of wilde asses, and this custome also preuailed at Athens, where they did eat the flesh of old Asses, which hurteth the stomach, hauing in it no good iuice or sweetnesse, and is verye hard to be digested. In like sort about the coasts of Alexandria, men vse to eate the flesh of Asses, G l nus. which begetting in their body much melancholike and adusted humor, causeth them to fall into the Elephantia or spotted leprosie. Asses are tamed at three yeares old, and taught for those businesses which they must be applied vnto, some for the mill, some for husbandry and the plough, some for bur∣thens and carriage, some for the wars, and some for draught. Merchants vse Asses to carry their wine, oyle, corne, and other things to the sea-side; wherefore the countrey man maketh principall account of this beast for his carriage too and fro, being fit to ca∣rie both on his necke and on his backe: Co l mella with them they go to market with their wares, & vpon them bring home their houshold necessaries. Tarde costas agitator aselli, Vilibus aut onerat pomis, lapidem{que} reuertens, Incussum, aut atrae massam picis uerbe reportat. They grinde in their milles and fetch home their corne, they plough their lande, as in Campania, Lib a and Batia, where the ground is soft, and in Bizantium that fruitful coun∣trey, Pliny. Mulis quis in familia sunt. which repayeth the husbandmans labor with increase of an hundred and fifty times more then the seed, and where in drie-weather their ground is not arable with the whole strength of Buls, yet after a little rain, one Asse in one end of a yoke, and an old woman at the other end, doe easily draw the plough, and open the earth to sow their seed: wher∣fore cato said merrily, that Mules, Horsses and Asses, keepe no holli-daies, except they be such Asses as keepe within dores. Ad haec v ehi cula non ni∣nua pondere tr hit. In like sort they draw from place to place the carts of Bakers, or carts laded with any other carriage, if it be not ouergreat. The people carmani (by reason they want horsses) vse Asses in their warres, so also do the Saracori, who neuer vse them in milles or any such base works, but vpon them vnder take all their martiall perils. Strabo. There was a custome amongst the cumani, that when a wo∣man was taken in adultery, Aelianus. she was led to the market, and there set vpon a bare stone, af∣terward she was set vpon a bare Asses backe, and so carried throughout the citty, then brought backe againe to the former stone for a publike spectacle to all the citty, Su as whereby she remained infamous all her life after, and was called Onobatis, that is; one that had ridden an Asse: and the stone whereupon she stood, was accounted an vnlucky, and an odious place for all posterity. In like sort among the Parthians it was held a disgracefull thing to ride or be carried vpon a bare Asses backe. Anatolius The dung of Asses is pretious for a ga den, especially for Cabadges; and if an apple tree be diyng, it may be recouered by washing it in Asses dung by the space of six daies, and some haue vsed to put into Gar∣dens the skull of a mare, H n caput Ar nudum c ie sertur , T henus finisse Tages in mute ruris or she-asse that hath beene couered in copulation, with perswa∣sion that the gardens will be the more fruitfull. Asses are of very foolish condicions and slender capacity, but yet very tame, not re∣fusing any manner of burthen although it breake his backe: being loaded it will not out of the way for any man or beast, and it only vnderstandeth the voice of that man, with whom it is laboured, knowing also the way whereunto it is accustomed. Ammonianus was in such loue with an Asse, and holding him of so great capacity, that he had one con¦tinually to heare his Lectures in Phylosophie. Gallen affirmeth, that an Asse vnderstan∣deth genus species & indiuidium, S nda , because if you shew him a Camell that neuer saw one be∣fore, he is terrified and cannot indure his sight: but if he haue been accustomed to such a sight, if you shew him neuer so many, he is not moued at them. In like sort, hee know∣eth men in generall, being not affraid of them, but if he see or heare his keeper, he know∣eth him for his keeper or maister. There was a cunning player in Affrica, in a citty called Alcair, Leo Affric: who taught an Asse diuers strange tricks or feats; for in a publicke spectacle, turning to his Asse (being on a scaffolde to shew sport) said; The great Sultan purposeth to builde him a house, and shall neede all the Asses of Alcair to fetch and carry wood, stones, lime, and other necessaries for that bu∣sines: presently the Asse falleth downe, turneth vp his heeles into the aire, groneth, and shutteth his eies fast, as if he had bene dead: while he lay thus, the player desired the be∣holders to consider his estate, for his Asse was dead, he was a poore man, and therefore moued them to giue him money to buy another asse. In the meane time hauing gotten as much mony as he could, he told the people he was not dead, but knowing his maisters po∣uerty counterfaited in that maner, whereby he might get mony to buy him prouender, and therefore he turned againe to his Asse and bid him arise, but he stirred not at all. Then did he strike and beate him sore (as it seemed) to make him arise, but all in vaine, the asse lay still. Then saide the player againe, our Sultan hath commaunded that to morrow there be a great triumph without the cittie, and that all the Noble women shall ride thither vppon the fairest asses, and this night they must be fed with Oates, and haue the best Water of Nilus to drinke: At the hearing whereof, vp starteth the asse, snorting and leaping for ioy: then said the plaier, the gouernor of this towne hath desired me to lende him this my asse for his old deformed wise to ride vpon, at which words the asse hangeth downe his eares, and vn∣derstanding like a reasonable creature, beganne to halt as if his legge had beene out of ioynt: why but saide the plaier, haddest thou leifer carrye a faire young Woman? The asse wagged his head in token of consent to that bargaine, goe then (said the player) and among all these faire Women chuse one that thou mayest carry; then the asse looketh round about the assemblye, and at last went to a sober Woman and touched her with his nose, whereat the residue wondered and laughed, shutting vppe the sport, with cry∣inge out; An asses Woman, an asses Woman, and so the player went vnto another towne. Such thinges doe serue to teach vs that asses are not altogither indocible, besides in their owne nature they knowe how to refresh themselues in their Wearinesse by wallo∣wing on the grounde, and being ouercome with melancholy humour, Aelianus. they naturally looke for the hearbe Citterach or Finger-ferne to cure them. When the asses of Maurusium are bound to a iourney, they set forwarde so fast, Aelianus that a man would thinke they rather flewe then ranne, but being ouerwearied they are so abased that they send foorthe teares, and then are they drawen at Horsses tayles to their iourneyes end. The asse is neuer at peace with the Cro, because it longeth for the asses eyes; likewise the bird Salem, for when the asse commeth to the thornes to rub himselfe where the said birde buildeth her nest, the asse spoyleth it, wherefore the said birde maketh continuall assault vppon him. In like sort the Colota or Stellio, for it sleepeth in the maungers, and creepeth vp into the asses nose to hinder him from eating. The Woolfe is also an enimy to the asse, for he loueth his flesh, and with small force doeth he compasse the destruction of an asse, for the blockish asse when he seeth a wolfe, Aelianus▪ layeth his head on his side, that so he might not see, thinking that because he seeth not the Wolfe, the Wolfe cannot see him; but the wolfe vpon this aduantage setteth vppon the beast on the blind side, and easily destroyeth the couragelesse asse. Another argu∣ment of an asses stupidity, is that he careth not for his owne life, but will with quietnesse starue, if meat be not laide before him. Wherefore it is apparant that when a dull schol∣ler not apt to learne is bid to sell an asse to signifie his blockishnes, is no vaine sentence; Aristo therefore they which resemble asses in their head, round forehead, or great face, are said to be blockish; in their fleshy face, fearefull; in broad or great eies, simple; and like to be stone mad, in thicke lips, and the vpper hanging ouer the nether, Fooles; and in their voyce, contumelius and disdainefull. To conclude, the ancients haue made many significati∣ons of asses and their shapes, making a man with an asses head to signifie; First, one igno∣raunt of manners, histories and countryes. Secondly, immoderate riot of stubborne persons in scripture is deciphered in an Asse. Thirdly, impudency and shamelesnesse, because an Asse will not for any stripes forsake his owne waies. Fourthly, the Iewish people, who like Asses could not vnderstand euident truth of Christ in the plaine text of Scripture, wherefore our sauiour secretly vpbraided their dulnes, when he rode vpon an Asse. Fiftly, the Egyptians by an Asse, noted a man with∣out all diuine knowledge; wherefore they vsed to take an Asse and follow him with all de∣spight, beating him from place to place till hee brake his owne necke; for they beleeued, that an asse was possessed of a deuill. Sixtly, Indocibility, by an asse bridled. Seuenthly, the snares of flatterers; for their priestes set an asse betweene flowers and oyntmentes, neither of both pertaining to an asses skill, teaching thereby, how mighty men fall by treachery of flatterers. Eightly, a woman dissembling her Praegnancy. Ninthly, by a man, weauing a cord, and an asse behind him biting it asunder, they signifie, a painefull husband, and a prodigall wife. Tenthly, a good vine-dresser, for when an asse did bite off the braunch of a vine, it was obserued that the next yeare the vine was more fruitfull: finally base seruility, trifling sluggishnes, good fortune, tyrants, and fooles are Hierogli∣phically comprized vnder the discourse of asses. Touching such medicinall vertues as haue bene tried and founde to be in the seuerall parts of Asses, by learned and approued writers, now in the conclusion of this historye they shall be briefely remembred, and so this narration be finished. A draught or two of the same water whereof an Asse or an Oxe hath drunke, will ease the head-ach, the forehead of an asse tyed to the flesh of one that hath the falling euill, cureth him; Marcellus Pliny. and the braine of an asse steeped in sweet water and infumed in leaues, wher∣of taken for certaine dayes, halfe an ounce, easeth the falling euill: the number of which daies cannot be lesse then thirty, but this is very ridiculous, that if a man hurt by a scor∣pion, Pliny. do whisper his harme in the eare of an asse, presently the hurt ceaseth. When one is vexed with a quotidian feuer, with three drops of blood out of the vaine of an Asses eare, put into eighteene ounces of water and drunke by the patient, easeth that paine. The liuer of an asse burnt, driueth away venomed things, and the same dried and beat to pouder; Haly. helpeth the cough and shortnes of breath, and rosted to be eaten, if it bee eaten fasting it is good against the falling euill. Other say, if it be mixed with Opponax, and in∣stilled into the mouth forty daies togither, defendeth infants from the aforesaide sick∣nes. Pliny. Also the hart of a male blacke asse, eaten with bread at the euening, in the first or se∣cond day of the moone, is good against the falling euill. The liuer dryed with parsely, & three walnuts clensed from the pill and put into hony, is marueilous good for one that is liuer sicke, Marcellus the ashes of it mixt with oyle, taketh away Wens; and the ashes of the liuer and the flesh is good against the chapping, Auicen. clefts, or slifters in the body, which come by cold: but Dioscorides ; whom I rather follow, attributeth both these vertues to the ashes of the hoofe. He which is sicke of the milt, may be holpe with the old milt of an asse, if he eat thereof euery day dried and fasting, he shall find case by it within three dayes. The same first dryed and then steeped in water, Sextus maketh the dugs full of milke, so also doeth the spleene, Rasis. and the spleene with sewet of a beare, and oyle made as thicke as hony, by annointing the eyelids therewith, restoreth the haires which are wanting. The reynes ineretatrated, Marcellus. brused, and put into new pure wine, do help the bladder, and stay the in∣continency of the vrine. The same dried, burned, and beaten into very small pouder, whereof a nut shell full put into two cups of pure wine and drunke off, cureth the stran∣gury. Pliny It is thought that with the pouder of the Asses genitall, the haire may be made grow thicker: and the same beaten with leade and oyle, and annointing the heade where gray haires are shauen off, keepeth it from more graye haires. The stones of an Asse kept in salt and sprinkled in a potion of asses milke or Water, helpeth the fallinge euill. The gall of an asse or a bull, either of them, seuerally broke into water, taketh away the spots in the face, if after the patients skin be pilled, he must keepe himselfe from sun and wind. The blood of an asse staieth the flux of blood cōming from the skin or films of the brain; and two or three drops of the same drunke with wine, cureth a quotidian feuer: Eseulapius. Pliny. the selfe same thing is reported of the bloud let out of the veine in the eare. The bloud of the foale of an Asse with wine, cureth the Kinges evill. The froath or scum of Nitre with the fat of an Asse or the fatte of a Sowe, cureth the bitinges of Dogges: Dioscorides and if there bee any scarres in the body, the fatte maketh them of the same colour with the residue of the bodye: And if one vexed with the falling euill, be annointed with the suet or fat of an Asse it will ease them very much, likewise the marrow of Asses helpeth the scabs from a man, and with the suet the places infected with Catthars, Leprosies, or Scarres, Rasis. re∣ceiue their former colour: and the skinne laid vpon young infants, Pliny maketh them with∣out feare. And if the bill of a Heron wrapped in an Asses skinne, bee bound to ones fore∣head, it prouoketh sleepe. A palsie man will fall downe if he tast of the perfume made of the haires of an Asse or Mule. The ashes of the haires of Asses, stayeth bleeding; Trallianus. and the same hath the more force if they be of a male, and be mixed with vineger and laide in wooll to the yssue blee∣ding. The bones of an Asse broken and sod, Pliny. are very soueraigne against the venom of a sea-Hare-fish. The poulder of an Asses hoofe drunke a moneth togither, two spoon∣fuls at a time, helpeth the falling euill very greatly: and the same mixed with oyle, Galenus. hel∣peth the kings euill; and being put vpon Kibes or Chil-blanes, cureth them. The hoofs of Asses burned and beaten to poulder, giuen to them that haue the falling euil in drink, Myrepsus. helpeth them speedily; also a burned hoofe is mingled with many medicines▪ to cure the swelling of the Nauell in children, and the hoofs perfumed procure speedy deliuerance in trauaile of yong, that the dead thing may come forth, otherwise it is not vsed, Aetius. for it will kill the liuing yong ones. The dust thereof with the milke of an Asse, by annointing cureth the scars and webs of the eies, and as Marcellus saith, only the parings of an Asses hoofe scraped and ming∣led with a womans milke; and they say, that if an Epilectick man weare a ring made of an asses hoofe wherin is no blacknes, it will preserue him from falling. The poulder of an asses hoofe burned and beaten, laide in vineger and made in little bals, and one of them put into the mouth and there held, helpeth the loosnesse and paine in the teeth. Galen. There is a collection of certaine hard matter about an asses legges, called Lichen, which if it be burned and beaten and put into old oyle, will cause haires to grow out of baldnes, and it is of such force, that if it be applyed to a womans cheek, it will produce the same effect, and mingled with vineger, it raiseth vp the lethargike man. And if a man take the ring-wormes growing naturally on Asses legges, Marcellus and shredding them into pouder put them in vineger, it staieth all paine in the heade, which maketh one sleepy. The flesh of Asses sod in pottage helpeth them that haue the Phthisis or disease of the Lungs, and there are some which prescribe the taking of Asses flesh, or the blood of Asses mingled with vineger to be taken forty daies togither against the falling euill. Pliny. The milke of an asse mingled with hony and drunke, loosneth the bellie, and therefore Hypocra∣tes gaue it for a gentle purgation being moister then anie other kind of milke, and fitter to take downe the bellie. It will also ease the tooth-ache, if the teeth be washed in it, Archigenes and fa∣sten them that are loose, being verie good to wash the teeth withall. Galen gaue asses milk mixt with honie, to one in a consumption when he came newly from a bath, and therfore it is giuen in feuers hecticks and all consuming diseases because the substance of it is fitter for detersion then nutriment: when the brests are in paine, by drinking asses milke they be holpe, and the same mingled with honie, causeth womens purgation, by drinking asses milke an exulcerat stomacke is relieued: likewise all other pains in the stomack, which come of sadnesse or sorrow, sighing, and desperation: Pliny. and Heraclides gaue asses milke with anni∣seed to one that had his lights stopped, and it is likewise commended against the cough, extenuation, spitting of blood, dropsie and hardnes of the spleene, but it is not good for a weake head troubled with giddines or noise, yet will it loosen the hardnes of the bellie in a feuer. It is also priuately vsed against eating of morture, white lead, sulphur, and quicksiluer; and when a mans meate doeth not neither nourish nor disgest, let him drinke Asses milke safelie, and it is also good to gargarize in sore chappes or throates. Likewise in a seuer when there is no head-ache. . The auncient in old time gaue Asses milke to children before meat, Galenus. and for want thereof Goats-milke: for sore mouths, it must be gargarized. It is very profitable against the collicke and bloudy Flixe, if honie be put thereunto; the loos∣nes or desire of stoole is taken away by drinking Asses milke: the whay or milke of an Asse did Hyppocrates prescribe against the consumption of the raynes or backe, and the same with a root of a pomgranat against the loosenes and other diseases of the belly to be drunke. Pliny Also there are examples where the whay of Asses milke haue helped the gowt, both in hand and foot: sweet water with Asses milk is wholsome against poyson of Hen-bane, & o∣ther poysons, Pliny. but it must be vsed new or else soone after warmed: This milke will wake wo∣mens skins whiter, Pliny. wherefore, Poppea, the wife of Domitius Nero carried about with her in her progresse fifty milche Asses, wherewith she did vse to bath her selfe. The vrine with the owne dung, healeth straight shooing, scabs in a man, and the rough∣nesse of the nayles. It taketh away the scurffe of Oxen. It is giuen in drinke, to cure them that haue ache in their raines, and with Pepper-wort it is profitable against suppurations and apostems in the flesh. Dioscorides If any be hurt by the starres, wash them in asses stale, mingled with Spiknard: Galen. the same force hath it against cornes and all hardnesse or thickenesse of skinne. The dung of asses new with oyle of Roses, Pliny. distilled warme into the eares, helpeth deasenes, and pushes or suddaine boyles of the heade, are cured with the ioyce of asses dung, and of sea-oynions beat to pouder, Marcellus and the fat of beefe, layed to the boyles like a plaister: both the dung of asses and horsses eyther raw or burnt mingled with Vineger, restrayneth blee∣ding both in fluxes and wounds, Dioscorides vsed like a plaister, being new and mingled with vineger, and for the bleeding at the nose, snuffe in the ashes of asses dung burnt to powder. The dung of asses cureth the Piles, Aetius. and the same dried and moistened in wine being drunk of cat∣tell which are stung with scorpions, cureth them if it be at grasie; and it is found true by long experience, that the dung of an asse rubbed, in quantity two sponfuls, and taken euery day, deliuereth one from the falling euill. Et miceus prodest ex vhere succus asellae. Si tepedo infundas ac mello piperque. This is good against the gall and running ouer thereof, if it be mingled with warme wine, pepper, and hony. The Syrians call the dung of a young Foale which it first casteth vp after the foaling, Polean ; and giue it against the sicknesse of the milk. In sapa decoctum colo megnopere prodest. The same is good against the collicke and the bloody flixe. The iuyce of asses dung, asses milke, and sweet wine, annointed on the sick member, cureth the gowt: and the same stay∣eth the flowers of women with childe, the iuyce heereof cureth the closing vp of the eyes in the night. The skinne wherein the young foale lyeth in the dammes belly being smelled vnto, by him that hath the falling euill, it easeth him. Anaxilaus hath reported, that if the excrements of a Mares copulation be burned, there will appeare monstrous shapes of Horsses heads. If a horsse haue a web in his eye, mingle togither the milke of an asse, the blood of a Doue, and the dew of Cabadges, and anoint him therewith: and there be some which take of the dirt where an asse hath made water in the way, and therewith annoint the scabbes of sheepe for their recouery: but when one is stroken with a scorpion, the asses dung must be presentlye applyed, or else it profiteth nothing in that malady. OF THE HINNVS, Jnnus, and GINNVS, Mannus mannulus Befi & Burdones, &c. T Here is no language beside the Greeke that haue any wordes to expresse these beasts, and the Latines haue deriued these termes from them. These are beasts of a small size as dwarfes among men, and therefore seldome seene in these parts of the world. They which are called Hinni, Caelius Rh d-Collumella are conceiued of a horse, & a shee asse, who althogh they take their denomina∣tion from the male, yet do they more resemble the female. In ancient time, the males which were conceiued of a horse and a shee Asse, were called Hinnuli, Pliny. and likewise of an Asse and a mare, Muli, so are the young ones of little goats, Deer, Hermol us. hares, and other like: although some take Innuli for the young harts, and the Hinni and Hinnuli for the breede of a horse and an Asse; so that there appeareth two kinds, Varro. and both of them transplanted out of other. The Hinnus is lesse then the Mule, but more ruddie, hauing ears like a horse, and a mane and taile like an asse, lying in the wombe before the foling twelue monthes like a horsse, Nonius. and are brought vp like little horsses, whose age is discerned by their teeth, and they are sometimes procreated of a horse and a Mule, and because of their aptnes to beare, Perot. they are called Burdones, or else of Bardus by reason of their folly and slownes. Manni and Mannuli are very little low horses, being very gentle and easie to be handled, Porp yrius being called also among the Ciuilians, Burdi. There is in France not farre from Gration po∣lis, a kind of Mules which in the countrey speech are called Iumar, being bred of an Asse and a Bull, and in the Heluetian alpes beyond Curia, about the towne Speluga, I haue bin sincerely informed, that there was a horse conceiued of a bull and a mare, and therefore Scaliger saith, that such a foale is called Hinnulus, whereof hee reporteth he had seene many, and he himselfe had two of them, and at that instant had onely one female, betwixt whose eares there were two bony bunches about the bignes of halfe a Wal-nut, giuing euident testimony by the forehead, that her father or Syre was a bull: and some say, that this kinde want their vpper teeth: and their vnderchappe doeth in a deformed manner stretch foorth it selfe beyond the vpper, as it is in many fishes, being called of the Gaba∣la and Aruerni, Befi: And at this day there is in the court of France a certaine beast which in the former part is like an asse, and in the hinder a sheepe. Auerg e & Lodoue Na∣uert. In Ferraria amonge other strange beasts, they nourish dwaruish Asses, of whom Martiall made a Dislichon to this effect, that they are not so high as a man, when he sitteth on the ground. His tibi de mulis non est metuenda ruina: Altius in terris pene sedere soles. For the Innus, and Ginnus, or Hinnus, they are conceiued by a Mule and a Mare, which are very small by reason of some disease the damme that beareth them hath in her belly: the worde Inis signifying a young or newe borne Nephew, and is attributed to this kind of beasts, because they neuer exceed the quantity of young foles. Both the Mule and the Burd remaine barren and neuer conceiue, Albertus. Promptuat. these neighe like a horse, and that brayeth like an asse. A Musimon is a short horse, asse, or Mule. OF THE WILDE ASSE. A Wilde Asse, called of the Latines Onager, of the Haebrewes Arod and Ere, and as Sebastian Munster affirmeth Meroda and Arda ; In the German tongue it may be tearmed Ein Walde∣sell, and the young ones are called Lalisions. Dum t ner est Onager solaque lalisio matre: Pascit hoc infans sed breue nomen habet. Martial. These wilde Asses are not Elks, as some haue reported of Elks, nor that Oryx which the auncient writers do constant∣ly affirme to liue in a continuall thirst, as for the most part wilde Asses do. Of these Asses are great store in Phrygia, Lycaonia, Countrey of breed. and Affrica, and it is saide, that the Saracen king of Tunis in Affricke, sent vnto Ferdinand king of Naples, a goodly great wild Asse, such an one as hath not bene seene in this part of the world. Apollonius affirmeth, that he saw wilde asses in great plenty beyond Catadupa in Egypt, so are there many in Ca da, an Island neere Creet: In Persis, in Asia, in Madera, and Aba∣sia, Arabia desert, Mauritania, and Armenia. Callistus reporteth that there are such wild Asses in that region vnder the Aequinoctiall towards the East and South, of wonderfull stature, Pliny. their skin (beside the vsuall manner) being of diuers colours, interlined variably with white and blacke, and the Zones and strakes discending from the top of the backe vnto the sides, and there diuided by their winding and turning, make the folds appeare of admirable variety. These Asses loue the highest Mountaines and rockes, as holy scripture teacheth, Ier. 14. The asses stood in the high places and drew in the wind like Dragons: which words gaue occasion to some to imagine, that wilde asses would quench their thirst with the winde without water: whereas it is the maner of all wilde beasts, in extreamity of thirst, to gape wide and greedily draw in the colde refreshing ayre; and they will not drinke but of pure fountaine water. They liue in flocks and great companies togither, but in desolate pla∣ces: the males going before the females, and commonly one male will leade and rule a flocke of females, being exceeding swift, and fearfull, and therfore do they often change their places of abode; and yet it is obserued, that the wilde Asses of Licia neuer go ouer the mountaine that diuideth them from Cappadocia. They engender among themselues, Their copu∣lation. their females being much more lustfull then the males, and therefore doe the males obserue and watch them with a ielous eye towarde their owne soles, especially after they haue conceiued; and the female as warily avoideth the sight of the male, especially at the time of her foling: for if she bring forth a female, the male receiueth it with all loue, ioy, and welcome; but if a male, then doth he with angry and enuious countenance look vpon it, taking it heauily that another male is bred, which in time may in the fathers place possesse his damme: wherfore in a raging madnes he falleth vpon the fole, seeking by al his power to bite off his stones: the poor female al∣though weakened with paine of deliuery, yet helpeth her young one against the fathers rage, and like a mother who seeing her sonne slain in war, embraceth his bleeding corps, and cryeth out with dolefull voice, tearing her cheekes and bleeding betwixt her brests: so would you thinke this silly female asse, to mourne for her fole, now ready to die by the Syres cruelty; saying, O my husband why is thy aspect so irefull? Why are thy eyes now become so bloody, which euen now were as white as light? Doest thou looke vpon the face of that monster Medusa? Which turneth men into stones, or dost thou look vpon some new hatched horrible Dra∣gon, or the whelpe of some lyon lately littered? Why wilt thou geld this our young one which na∣ture hath giuen vnto vs both by procreation: O wretched beast that I am, which haue conceiued an vnhappy fole by the fathers wickednes, O my poore, and more vnhappy sonne, which for a iea∣lous feare art depriued of thy naturall parts, not by the clawes of Lyons (for that I would endure) but by the vnnaturall and more then hostile teeth of thy owne father. These wilde Asses haue good and stronge hoofes, their swiftnes is compared to the winde, and in the time that they are hunted, they cast backward with their heeles stones with such violence, as they pierce the brests of them that prosecute them if they be not very wary. They are of a large, broad, tall, and beautifull body; long eares, and a siluer colour, (that is as I gesse) a bright cloud-colour, for it is but vaine to imagine, that an Asse can be all white, for then were all the auncients deceiued, which with one voyce affirme, that he hath a blacke list on the backe, at either side whereof are two white lines. Aelianus Albertus. Oppianus. Their food is onely grasse and herbes of the earth, whereby they grow very fat, their hart being the fattest part of their body, and they will not abide any flesh-eating-beaste, especially the Lyon whom he feareth very much, for all these strong beasts deuour and eat them. These Asses are very fit for ciuill vses, as for plowing and sowing, Varro. for being tamed they neuer grow wilde againe as other beasts will, and they easily grow tame. It is obserued that the same being tamed, is most tame which before time was most wilde. They loue figs and meale aboue all things, wherefore the Armenians vse to take a certain blacke fish bred in their waters which is poyson, Aelianus. and couering it with meale the wilde as∣ses come and licke thereof, and so are destroyed. The best of them are generated of a Mare and a wild Asse tamed, for they are the swiftest in course, of hardest hoofe, a leane body, but of a generous and vntierable stomack. The Indian wild Asses haue one horne in their foreheade, and their body all white, but their heade is red: So is there another beast in India very like a wilde asse, which the inhabitants eat (as we haue read) about the streights of Magellana : When these Asses are hunted with dogs, they cast foorth their sime or dung, with the sauour whereof the Dogges are stayed while it is hot, Phyles. and by that meanes the beast escapeth daunger: but the Asses of Mauritania are very short winded, Pliny. and subiect to wearinesse and stumbling, for which cause they are more easily taken, and the best of all are not so swift as a Barbary -horse; besides their nature is, when they see a man, to stand stone stil, crying, braying, and kicking, till you come at them, Aelianus. and when one is ready to take them, they take their heeles and run away. The inhabitants of Ara∣bia desert, by many gins and other deceitfull deuises take them, and on horsebacke fol∣low them till they tyre or can strike them with their darts. Their flesh being hot, doeth stinke and taste like an other Asses, but boyled and kept two dayes hath a pleasant taste; yet doth it not breede good blood, because it is viscous and harde to be concocted, al∣though there be many which eat that, as also the flesh of Panthers and other such beasts. Pliny teacheth, Medicine . that there is more vertue in the wilde Asses milk and bones against ve∣nome and poyson, then in the tame. Likewise, in the heele of an Asse, Milke. is a principall re∣medy against apostemations and bunches in the flesh, if it be applyed to the inner part of the thighe. The gall, draweth out botches and must bee annointed vpon impostu∣mate scars. It is vsed also in emplasters against Saint Antonies fire, the leprosie, Pliny and swel∣ling in the legs and guts. The fat with oyle of herbe- Mary by annointing the raines and the backe, helpeth and easeth that paine which was ingendred by wind. The spleen dryed to pouder and drunke in wine or drinke, is good against the sicknes of the spleene. The flesh is good against the paine in the ridge and hip-bones: and Galen affirmeth, that the vrine breaketh and dissolueth the stone in the bladder. The ashes of the hoofe helpeth the falling euill, and mingled with oyle, cureth the kinges euill, and the loosenes of the hayre The marrow easeth the gowt, and the dung mixed with the yolke of an Egge and applyed to the fore-head, stayeth bleeding: also the same curleth the hayre if it be min∣gled with an Oxes gall and dryed: put into wine and drunke, cureth the sting of a scorpi∣on: and Zor an Haebrew affirmeth very constantly, that if a man looke into an Asses eye, it preserueth the sight, and hindereth the Water that descendeth into the eye. Of the Scythian Asses. T He Asses of Scythia haue hornes wherein it is reported that the Stygean Wa∣ter of Arcadia may be contained, Aelianus. although it will eat through all other vessels be they neuer so hard. Sosipater brought of them to Alexander the great, who admiring the rarenesse, would not put them to any priuate vse but sent them to Delphos, to be offered to Pithias ; but that these can be properly called Asses, no man can defend, L b. 4 although Herodotus also affirme, that among the Affricans called Aratours, there be asses with hornes. Of the Indian Asses. I T is questionable whether the Monoceros, commonly called a Vnicorne, the Rhinoceros, the Oryx, and the Indian asse be all one beast or diuers; for the Vnicorne and Rhinoceros haue the same things attributed to them in stories, and differ in verie few reports: but for the Asses of India, both Aristotle, Pliny, and Aelianus, ioyntly agree, that they differ from all other whole-footed beasts, because they haue one horne in the fore∣head, and so also haue the Rhinoceros, Monoceros, and Orix, but the Indians cal a Vnicorn, Cartazono ; and the horn so highly pri∣zed at this day, is thought to be of the Rhinoceros, but Aelianus and Philes acknowledge no other Vnicorne then the Indian Asse, who in bignes equalleth a horse among the In∣dians, being all white on the body, but purple headed or red (as some say,) blacke eyes, but Volaterranus saith blew, hauing one horne in the fore-head a cubit and a halfe long, whose vpper part is red or bay, the middle blacke, and the neather part white, wherein the Kings and mighty men of India vse to drinke, adorning it for that purpose with sun∣dry bracelets, precious stones, and works of gold, holding for truth that all those which drinke in those hornes, shalbe freed from annoyance of incurable diseases, as conuulsi∣ons, the falling euill, and deadly poysons. These wilde-asses exceed all other, both in stature of body, and also swiftnes of foote, for at the first, they set forth very gently, and afterward speed their iourney with better pace, so that it is very hard for any to follow them, but impossible to ouergo them. The males take great paines in keeping their young ones, whom they continually watch and hide in the most remote and desert places they can finde. When they are hunted, they keepe their weake young ones behind them, and fight for them very furiously, neyther feare they to encounter horsemen. They are so strong, that no beast may stand before them, for they will receiue the charge of Horsses with such violence, that in their en∣counter they bite out their sides & tear their guts out of their belly: for which cause they are dreadfull to Horsses, who are most vnwilling to ioyn with them, for they neuer meet but they both perish. They fight with their heeles, but their teeth are most daungerous, for what they ap∣prehend in them they bring it cleane away: and because of this rage, those which are of any yeares, can neuer be tamed. The great king of India doth once euery yeare appoint all manner of fights both of men and Beastes, wherein are wilde Buls, tame Rams, these wild Asses with one horne, Hyaenaes and Elephants. To conclude, it is but a fable of Vo∣laterranus, that saith, these Asses want a gal, for they haue the bladder of the gal, a poti∣on whereof drunke, cureth the falling euill. Of the Alborach and Axis. T Here are two other beasts to be added to the end of this ranke, namely, the Alborach among the Turks, being a faire white beast like an Asse, whereupon the turkish priestes blasphemous idolaters, perswade the silly pilgrims of Me∣cha, that Mahomet was carried vp to heauen. The Axis of which Pliny speaketh, is a wilde beast, hauing a skinne like the Hinnulus aforesaid, but spred ouer with whiter spots, which is bred in India, Bellonius affirmeth, that he saw two of them in the Castle of Cair, a male and a female, and either sex wanted hornes, hauing long tayles down to their mid-legs like deere, and differ very little from deere, sauing in their large white spots and yellow colour, yeelding a much more cleare sounding voyce then a deere, and the female thereof is smaller then the male. This beast is by idolatrous people dedicated to their drunken God Bacchus. OF THE BADGER, OTHER VVISE called a Brocke, a Gray, or a Bauson. T He Badger could neuer find a Greeke name, although some through ignoraunce haue foisted into a Greeke dictionary Melis, whereas in truth that is his Latine word, Mele or Me∣les, and so called, because aboue all other things, he loueth hony; and some later writers call him Taxus, Tassus, Taxo, and Alber. Magnus dax s. But wheras in the scripture some translate Tesson, Tahas, or Tachasch ; and plurally Techaseim, Badgers, yet is not the mater so cleare, for there is no such beauty in a badgers skin, as to couer the Arke, or to make princes shooes thereof: therefore some Haebrews say, that it signifieth an Oxe of an exceeding hard skinne. Onkelus translateth it Sasgona, that is, a beast skinne of diuers colours, Symcehus, and Aquila a iacinct colour, which cannot be; but the Arabians Darasch, and the Persians Asthak, yet it may be rather saide, that those skinnes spoken of Exod. 25. Numb. 4 Ezek. 26. be of the Linx, or some such other spot∣ted beast; for Tachasch commeth neere Thos, signifying a kind of Wolfe not hurtfull to men, being rough and hairy in winter, but smooth in summer. The Italians call a Badget Tasso, the Rhetians, Tasch: the French Tausson, Taixin, Tasson, Tesson, and sometime Grisart, for her colour: sometimes Blareau, and at Parris Bedouo. The Spaniardes, Tasugo, Texon, the Germans Tachs, or Daxs, the Illyrians Gezwecz. Badgers are plentiful in Naples, Sicilly, Lucane, and in the Alpine and Heluetian coasts, so are they also in England. In Lucane there is a certaine wilde beast, resembling both a beare and a Hog, not in quantity, but in forme and proportion of body; Countrey of breed. Caelius Curio. which the refore may be fitly called in Greeke Suarctos, for a Gray, in short legs, eares, and feet, is like a beare, but in fatnes like a swine. Therefore it is obserued, that there be two kinds of this beast, one resembling a Dog in his feet, which is cald Canine, the other, a hog in his clo∣uen hoofe, and is cald Swinish: also these disso the fashion of their snowt, Diuersitie of kindes. one resem∣bling the snowt of a Dog, the other of a swine, and in their mear, the one eating flesh and carrion like a Dogge, the other roo s and fru like a hog, as both kinds haue bene found in Normandy and other parts of France and . This beast diggeth her a den or caue in the earth and there liueth, neue comming forth but for meat and easement, which it maketh out of his den: whē they dig their den, after they haue entred a good depth for auoi∣ding the earth out, one of them falleth on the backe, and the other laieth all the earth on his belly, and so taking his hinder feet in his mouth, draweth the belly-laden-badger out of the caue, A secret in their manner of digging. Isidorus. Albertus. which disburdeneth her cariage, and goeth in for more till all be finished and emptied. The wily Foxe neuer maketh a Denne for himselfe, but finding a badgers caue, in her absence, layeth his excrement at the hole of the denne, the which when the Gray returneth, if she smell (as the sauour is strong) she forbeareth to enter as noisome, and so leaueth her elaborate house to the Fox. These badgers are verie sleepie, especiallie in the day time, and stirre not abroad, but in the night, for which cause they are called Lucifuga: that is; Their meate Auoyders of the light. They eat honie, and wormes, and hornets, and such like thinges, because they are not verie swift of foot to take other creatures. They loue Orchards, vines, and places of fruits also, and in the autumne they grow therewith verie fat. They are in quantitie as big as a Fox, but of a shorter and thicker bodie; their skin is hard, but rough and rugged, their haire harsh and stubborn, of an intermingled grisard colour, sometime white, sometime blacke, his backe couered with blacke, and his bellie with white, his head from the top thereof to the ridge of his shoulder, is adorned with strakes of white and blacke, being blacke in the middle and white at each side. He hath verie sharpe teeth, and is therefore accounted a deepe-biting beast. His back is broad, his legs (as some say) longer on the right side then on the left, and therefore he runneth best when he getteth to the side of a hill, Cardanus. or a cart-road-away. His taile is short but hairy, and of diuers colours, hauing a long face or snowt like the Zibethus: his forelegs being a full spanne long, and the hinder legs shorter short eares and little eies, a great bladder of gall, a body verie fat betwixt the skin and the flesh, and about the heart; and it is held that this fat increaseth with the Moon, and decreaseth with the same, being none at all at the change: his forelegs haue verie sharp nailes, bare and apt to dig withall, being fiue both before and behind, but the hinder verie short ones and couered with haire. His sauour is strong, and is much troubled with lice about his secrets, the length of his bodie from the nose which hangeth out like a hogges nose to the taile or rumpe, is some thirtie inches and a little more, the haire of his back three fingers long, his necke is short and a like a Dogs: both male and female haue vnder their hole another outwardlie, Her defence against Hun∣ters & theyr Dogs. but not inwardlie in the male. If she be hunted out of her denne with hounds, she biteth them greeuouslie if she lay hold on them, wherefore they a∣uoide her carefully, and the hunters put great broade collars made of a Graies skinne about their Dogges necke, to keepe them the safer from the Badgers teeth: her manner is to fight on her backe, vsing thereby both her teeth and her nailes, and by blowing vp her skinne aboue measure after an vnknowne manner, she defendeth her selfe against the strokes of men and the teeth of Dogges: wherefore she is hard lie taken, but by deuises and ginnes for that purpose inuented; with their skinnes they make quiuers for arrows, and some shepheards in Italy vse thereof to make sacks, wherein they wrappe themselues from the in∣iury of raine. Badg eaten. Platina. In Italy and Germany they eate Grayes flesh, and boile with it peares, which maketh the flesh tast like the flesh of a Porcupine. Medicine made of Bad. The flesh is best in September if it be fat, and of the two kindes, the swinish badger is better flesh then the other. There are sundry vertues con∣fected out of this beast; for it is affirmed, that if the fat of a badger mingled with crudy ho∣ny, Gratius and annointed vpon a bare place of a horsse, where the former haires are pulled off, it will make new white haires glowe in that place: Brasanolus. and it is certaine (although the Graeci∣ans make no reckoning of Badgers grease) yet it is a verie soueraigne thing to soften, and therefore Serenus prescribeth it to annoint them that haue feuers or inflamations of the bodie, Albertus. Nec spernendus adeps dederit▪ quem hestia melis. And not to be dispised for other cures: as for example, the easing of the paine of the raines if it be giuen in a glister, and likewise the fat of a dogge and a badger mingled togither, doe loosen contracted sinnewes. The ashes of a badger is found to helpe the bleeding of the stomacke, and the same sod and drunke, preuenteth daunger by the biting of a mad dogge: and Brunfelsius affirmeth, that if the blood of a badger be instilled into the hornes of cattell with salt, it keepeth them from the murrain, and the same dryed and beat to pouder doth wonderfully help the lepro∣sie. The braine sod with oyle easeth all aches, the liuer taken out of water, Bottillus. helpeth swellings in the mouth; and some affirme, that if one weare sole made of Badgers skins in their Shooes, it giueth great ease vnto the gowt. The biting of this beast is venemous, bicause it feedeth vpon all venemous meates which creepe vpon the earth, Brasanolus. although Arnoldus be of a contrary iudgement: and of this beast I can report no other thing worth the no∣ting, saue that the Noble family of the Taxons in Ferraria, tooke their name from this creature. OF THE BEARE. A Beare is called in the Haebrew Dob, and plurally Dobi , of the Arabians Dubbe, of the Chaldeans Duba, Aldub and Da∣boube ; Of the name of the Graecians Arctos, of some Dasyllis, because of the roughnes of his haire, of other Beiros, and Monios signifieth a solitary Beare. The Latines call him Vrsus, which some coniecture to be tanquam orsus, signifieng, that it is but begunne to be framed in the dammes belly, and prefected after the littering thereof. The Italians call it Orso, so also the Spaniards; the French, Ours, the Germans Baer, and Beer: the Bohemians Nedwed, the Po∣lontans Vuluuer : and the attributes of this beast are many among authors, both Greeke and Latine: Epithites of the beare as Aemonian beares, armed, filthy, deformed, cruell, dreadfull, fierce, greedy, Callidonian, Erymanthean, bloody, heauy, night-ranging, lybican, menacing, Numidian, Ossaean, headlong, rauening, rigide and terrible beare; all which serue to set forth the nature heereof, as shall be afterward in particular discoursed. First, Of the kind; of Beares Agricola. Albertus. therefore concerning seuerall kinds of beares, it is obserued, that there is in ge∣nerall two; a greater, and a lesser; and these lesser are more apt to clime trees then the other, neither do they euer grow to so great a stature as the other. Besides there are Beares which are called Amphibia ; because they liue both on the land and in the sea, hun∣ting and catching fish like an Otter or Beauer, and these are white coloured. In the Ocean Islands toward the North, there are bears of a great stature, fierce and cruell, who with their forefeet do breake vp the hardest congealed yse on the sea, or other great Waters, and draw out of those holes great aboundance of fishes: Ol uis. and so in other frozen seas are many such like, hauing blacke clawes, liuing for the most part vpon the seas, except tempestuous weather driue them to the land. In the Easterne parts of India there is a beast in proportion of body verie like a Beare, yet indued with no other quality of that kind, (being neither so wild, nor rauenous, nor strong) and it is called a Formicarian Beare, A Formica∣rian Beare. Cardanus. for God hath so prouided, that whereas that countrey is aboundantly annoyed with the Emmets or Ants, that beast doth so prey and feede vpon them, that by the strength and vertuous humour of his tongue, the sillie poore inhabitants are exceedingly relieued from their greeuious and daungerous num∣bers. Beares are bred in many countries, as in the Heluetian alpine region, where they are so strong and full of courage, Countrey of breed. that they can teare in pieces, both Oxen and Horsses, for which cause the inhabitants study by all means to take them. Likewise there are Beares in Persia, which doe rauen beyond all measure, and all other; so also the beares of N mi∣dia, Marcellinus. which are of a more elegant forme and composition then the residue; Profuit ergo nihil, misero quod communius vrsos: Figebat Numidas & Albena nudus arena. And wheras Pliny affirmeth, that there are no beares in Affrick, he mistook that country for Creet, and so some say, that in that Island be no Wolues, vipers, or other such vene∣mous creatures, whereof the Poets giue a vaine reason, because Iupiter was borne there: but, we know also, that there be no beares bred in England. In the countrey of Arabia, from the promontory Dira to the South, are beares which liue vpon eating of flesh, Volaterran being of a yellowish colour, which do farre excel all other bears, both in actiuity or swiftnes, and in quantity of body. Among the Roxolani and Lituani∣ans, are beares, which being tamed are presents for princes. Aristotle in his wonders repor∣teth, a secret in the natures of Beares. that there are white beares in Misia, which being eagerly hunted, do send forth such a breath, that putrifieth immediately the flesh of the Dogges, and whatsoeuer other beast commeth within the sauour thereof, it maketh the flesh of them not fit to be eaten: but if either men or dogs approach or come nigh them, they vomit forth such aboundance of Plegme, that either the hunters are thereby choaked or blinded. Thracia also breedeth white Beares, and the King of Aethiopia in his Haebrew Epistle which he wrote to the Bishop of Rome affirmeth, that there are Beares in his countrey: In Musconia are Beares, both of a snow white, yellow, and dusky colour, and it hath bene seene that the Noble womens chariots drawne by six horsses, haue beene couered with the skinnes of white beares, from the pasterne to the head: and as all other creatures doe bring forth some white, and some blacke, so also do Beares, who in generall doe breede and bring forth their young in all cold countries, some of a dusky and some of a browne blacke colour. A Beare is of a most venereous and lustfull disposition, Lust of beare for night and day the females with most ardent inflamed desires, doe prouoke the males to copulation; and for this cause at that time they are most-fierce and angry. Phillippus Cosseus of Constance, did most confidently tell mee, that in the Mountaines of Sauoy, a Beare carried a young maide into his denne by violence, Gillius. A History where in venereous manner he had the carnall vse of her body, and while he kept her in his denne, he dailye went foorth and brought her home the best Apples and other fruites he coulde get, pre∣senting them vnto her for her meat in very amorous sort; but alwaies when hee went to forrage, hee rouled a huge great stone vppon the mouth of his denne, that the Virgin shoulde not escape away: at length her parentes with long search, founde their little Daughter in the Beares den, who deliuered her from that sauage and beastuall captiuity. Time of their copulation. The time of their copulation is in the beginning of winter, althogh sometime in Sum∣mer, (but such young ones seldome liue) yet most commonly in February or Ianuary. The manner of their copulation is like to a mans, the male mouing himselfe vpon the belly of the female, which lyeth on the earth flat vpon the backe, and either embraceth other with their forefeet: they remaine verie long time in that act, inasmuch as if they were verie fat at their first entrance, they disioine not themselues againe till they he made leane. Immediately after they haue conceiued, they betake themselues to their dennes, Pliny. where they (without meate) grow very fat (especially the males) onely by sucking their fore∣feet. When they enter into their denne, they conuey themselues in backward, a secret that so they may put out their footsteps from the sight of the hunters. The males giue great ho∣nor to the females great with young, during the time of their secrecie, so that, Honor to the female. although they lie togither in one caue, yet doe they part it by a diuision or small ditch in the midst, neither of them touching the other. The nature of all of them is, to auoid cold, and ther∣fore in the winter time do they hide themselues, chusing rather to suffer famine then cold; auoiding of cold. lying for the most part three or foure moneths togither and neuer see the light, whereby their guts grow so empty, that they are almost closed vp and sticke togither. When they first enter into their denne, they betake themselues to quiet and rest, sleeping without any awaking, for the first fourteene daies, so that it is thought an easie stroke can∣not awake them. But how long the females go with young is not certaine, Time of bea∣ring the yong beares. some affirm 3. moneths, others but 30. daies, which is more probable, for wild beasts doe not couple themselues being with young (except a Hare and a Linx) aad the beares being (as is al∣ready said) verie lustull, to the intent that they may no longer want the company of their males, do violently cast their whelps and so presently after deliuery, do after the maner of conies betake themselues to their lust, & norishing their yong ones both togither: & this is certaine, that they neuer come out of their caues, till their young ones be thirtie daies old at the least, and Pliny precisely affirmeth, The bignesse of a beare-whelpe. that they litter the thirtith daie after their conception; and for this cause, a beare bringeth forth the least whelpe of all other great beastes, for their whelpes at their first littering are no bigger then rats, nor longer then ones finger. And whereas it hath beene beleeued and receiued, that the whelpes of bears at their first littering are without all forme and fashion, and nothing but a little congealed blood like a lumpe of flesh; which afterwarde the old one frameth with her tongue to her owne likenes, as Pliny, Solinus, Aelianus, Orus, Oppianus, and Ouid haue reported, yet is the truth most euidently otherwise, as by the eye witnes of Ioachimus Rhetichus, and other, Beares not so vnperfect as some haue re∣ported is disproued: onlie it is litterd blind without eies, naked without haire, and the hinder legs not perfect, the forefeet folded vp like a fist, and other members deformed by reason of the imoderate humor or moystnes in them which also is one cause, why the womb of the beare cannot retaine the seed to the perfection of her young ones. Number of yong one They bring foorth sometimes two, and neuer aboue fiue, which the old beare dailye keepeth close to her brest, so warming them with the heat of her body and the breath of her mouth, till they be thirty daies old; at what time they come abroad, being in the be∣ginning of May, which is the third moneth from the spring. The old ones being almost dazled with long darkenes, comming into light againe seeme to stagger and reele too and fro, and then for the straightnesse of their guts, by reason of their long fasting doe eat the herbe Arum, commonly called in English Wake-Robbin or Calues-foot, being of very sharpe and tart taste, Remedy in Nature. which enlargeth their guts, and so being recouered, they re∣maine all the time their young are with them, more fierce and cruell then at other times. And concerning the same Arum, called also Dracunculus and Oryx, there is a pleasaunt vulgar tale, whereby some haue conceiued that Beares eat this herbe before their lying secret; and by vertue thereof (without meat, or sence of cold) they passe away the whole winter in sleepe. There was a certaine cow-heard in the Mountains of Heluetia, which comming downe a hill with a great caldron on his backe, he saw a beare eating of a root which he had pul∣led vp with his feet; a fabulous tale yet vul∣garly belee∣ued. the cowheard stood still till the beare was gone, and afterward came to the place where the beast had eaten the same, and finding more of the same roote, did likewise eat it; he had no sooner tasted thereof, but he had such a desire to sleepe, that hee could not containe himselfe, but he must needs lie down in the way and there fell a sleep, hauing couered his heade with the caldron, to keepe himselfe from the vehemency of colde, and there slept all the Winter time without harme, and neuer rose againe till the spring time: Which fable if a man will beleeue, then doubtlesse this hearbe may cause the Beares to be sleepers, not for fourteene dayes, but for fourescore dayes toge∣ther. The meat of Beares. The ordinary food of Beares is fish: for the Water-beare and others will eate fruites, Apples, Grapes, Leaues, and Pease, and will breake into bee-hiues sucking out the ho∣ny; Horat: Vespertinus circumgemit vrsus ouile. Likewise Bees, Snayles, and Emmets, and flesh if it bee leane or ready to putrifie; but if a Beare doe chaunce to kill a swine, or a Bull, or Sheepe, he eateth them presentlie, whereas other beasts eate not hearbes if they eate flesh: likewise, they drinke water, but not like other beastes, neither sucking it or lapping it, but as it were, euen bitinge at it. Of the quan∣tity & partes of Beares. Some affirme, that Beares doe waxe or growe as long as they liue, that there haue beene seene some of them fiue cubits long; yea I my selfe saw a Beares skinne of that length, and broader then any Oxes skinne. The parts or members. The head of a Beare is his weakest part (as the hande of a Lyon is the strongest) for by a small blow on his head he hath often bene strucken deade, the bones of the head being verie thinne and tender: yea more tender, then the beake of a Parrot. The mouth of a Beare is like a Hogges mouth, but longer; being armed with teeth on both sides, like a saw, and standing deepe in his mouth, they haue verie thicke lippes, for which cause, hee cannot easily or hastily with his teeth breake asunder the hunters nettes, except with his forefeet. His necke is short, like a Tygers and a Lyons, apt to bend downeward to his meat, his bellie is verie large, being vniforme, and next to it the intrals as in a Wolfe: It hath also foure speanes to her Paps. The genitall of a Beare after his death waxeth as hard as horn, his knees and elbowes are like to an Apes, for which cause they are not swift or nimble: his feete are like handes, and in them and his loines is his greatest strength, by reason whereof, he sometimes setteth himselfe vpright vppon their hinder legges: the pasterne of his legge being fleshy like a cammels, which maketh them vnfit for trauell, they haue sharpe clawes, but a verye small taile as all other longe hayred creatures haue. They are exceeding full of fat or Larde-greace, which some vse superstitiouslie beaten with oile, a superstitius vse of Beares larde or fat. wherewith they annoint their grape-sickles when they go to vintage, perswading themselues that if no bodie know thereof, their tender vine braunches shall neuer be con∣sumed by catterpillers. Other, attribute this to the vertue of Beares blood, and Theophrastus affirmeth, that if beares grease be kept in a vessell, at such time as the beares lie secret, A secret. it will either fill it vp, or cause it to runne ouer. The flesh of beares is vnfit for meat, Meat of bea∣res flesh. yet some vse to eat it, after it hath bene twice sodde; other eat it baked in pasties, but the truth is, it is better for medicine then food. Theophrastus likewise affirmeth, that at the time when beares lie secret, their dead flesh encreaseth which is kept in houses, another se∣cret but beares forefeet are held for a verie delicate and vvell tasted foode, full of svveetnes, and much vsed by the German Princes. The skinnes of Beares are vsed in the farre Northerne regions for garmentes in the Winter time, which they make so artificially, The skinnes. couering themselues with them from the crowne of the head to the feete, that (as Munster affirmed) some men deceiued with that appearaunce, deemed the people of Lapponia to be hairy all ouer▪ The souldiors of the Moores weare garments made of Lyons pardals, and beares skinnes, and sleepe vppon them; and so is it reported of Herodotus Megarensis the Musitian, who in the day time wore a Lyons skin, and in the night lay in a Beares skin. The constitution of the body of a Beare is beyond measure Phlegmatique, because he fasteth in the Winter time so long without meate: His voyce is fierce and fearefull in his rage, but in the night time mournefull, being giuen much to rauening. If a Beare doe eat of Mandragoras, hee presently dieth, except he meete with Emmets, by licking of whome he recouereth: so likewise, if he be sicke of a surfet. A Beare is much subiect to blindnesse of the eyes, and for that cause they desire the hiues of Bees, not onely for the hony, but by the stinging of the bees, their eies are cu∣red. It hath not bene seene that a female Beare was taken great with young, which com∣meth to passe, by reason that they goe to their Dennes so soone as they are conceiued, and come not out thence till they haue littered: And because of the fiercenesse of this beast, they are seldome taken aliue, except they be very young: Taking of Beares. so that some are killed in the Mountaines by poyson, the Country being so steepe and rocky that hunters cannot followe them; some taken in ditches of the earth and other ginnes. Oppianus relateth, that neare Tygris and Armenia, the inhabitauntes vse this Stratigem to take Beares. The people go often to the Wooddes to finde the Denne of the Beare, following a leam-hound, whose nature is so soone as he windeth the beast, to barke, whereby his leader discouereth the prey, and so draweth off the hound with the leame; then come the people in great multitude and compasse him about with long nets, placing certaine men at each end: then tie they a long rope to one side of the net as high from the ground as the small of a Mans belly: whereunto are fastned diuers plumes and feathers of vultures, swannes, and other resplendant coloured birdes, which with the wind make a noise or his∣sing, turning ouer and glistering; on the other side of the net they build foure little houels of greene boughes, wherein they lay foure men couered all ouer with greene leaues, then all being prepared, they sound their Trumpets, and wind their horns; at the noise where∣of the beare ariseth, and in his fearefull rage, runneth too and fro as if he sawe fire the young men armed make vnto him, the beare looking round about, taketh the plainest way toward the rope hung full of feathers, which being stirred and haled by them that holde it, maketh the beare much affraid with the ratling and hissing thereof, and so flying from that side halfe mad, runneth into the nets, where the keepers entrap him so cunningly, that he seldome escapeth. When a Beare is set vpon by an armed man, he standeth vpright and taketh the man betwixt his forefeet, but he being couered all ouer with yron plates can receiue no harm, and then may easily with a sharpe knife or dagger pierce thorough the heart of the beast. If a shee beare hauing young ones be hunted, shee driueth her Whelpes before her vntill they be wearied, and then if she be not preuented, she climbeth vppon a tree, car∣rying one of her young in her mouth and the other on her backe. A Beare will not wil∣linglie fight with a man, but being hurt by a man, he gnasheth his teeth, and licketh his forefeete, and it is reported by an Ambassador of Poland, that when the Sarmatians finde a beare, they inclo the whole Wood by a multitude of people, standing not aboue a cubit one from another, then cut they downe the outmost trees, so that they raise a Wall of wood to hemme in the Beares; this being effected, they raise the Beare, hauing cer∣taine forkes in their hands made for that purpose, and when the Beare approacheth, they (with those forkes) fall vpon him, one keeping his head, another one leg, other his bo∣dy, and so withforce muzzle him and tie his legges, leading him away. The Rhaetians vse this policy to take Wolues and Beares: they raise vp great posts, and crosse them with a long beame laded with heauy weightes, vnto the which beame they fasten a corde with meat therein, whereunto the beast comming, and biting at the meat, pulleth downe the beame vpon her owne pate. The inhabitants of Heluetia hunt them with mastiffe Dogges, because they should not kill their cattell left at large in the fielde in the day time; They likewise shoote them with gunnes, giuing a good summe of money to them that can bring them a slaine beare. The Sarmatians vse to take Beares by this sleight; vnder those trees wherein bees breed, they plant a great many of sharpe pointed stakes, putting one hard into the hole wherein the bees go in and out, whereunto the Beare climbing, and comming to pull it forth, to the end that she may come to the hony, and being angry that the stake sticketh so fast in the hole, with violence plucketh it foorth with both her forefeet, whereby she looseth her holde and falleth downe vpon the picked stakes, whereupon she dieth, if they that watch for her come not to take her off. There was reported by Demetrius Ambassador at Rome, from the King of Musco, A History that a neighbor of his going to seek hony, fell into a hollow tree vp to the brest in hony, where he lay two days, being not heard by any man to complain; at length came a great Beare to this hony; and putting in his head into the tree, the poore man tooke hold thereof, wherat the Beare suddenly affrighted, drew the man out of that deadly daunger, and so ranne away for feare of a worse creature. But if there be no tree wherein Bees doe breed neere to the place where the Beare a∣bideth, then they vse to annoint some hollow place of a tree with hony, whereinto Bees will enter and make hony combes, and when the Beare findeth them she is killed as afore∣saide. In Norway they vse to saw the tree almost asunder, so that when the beast clim∣beth it, she falleth downe vpon piked stakes laid vnderneath to kill her: And some make a hollow place in a tree, wherein they put a great pot of Water, hauing annointed it with hony, Herus. at the bottome whereof are fastened certaine hookes bending downeward, leauing an easie passage for the beare to thrust in her head to get the honie, but impossible to pull it foorth againe alone, because the hookes take holde on her skinne: this pot they binde fast to a tree, whereby the Beare is take liue and blinde folded, and though her strength breake the corde or chaine where with the pot is fastened, yet can shee not escape or hurt any bodie in the taking, by reason her head is fastened in the pot. Poli . To conclude, other make ditches or pits vnder Apple trees, laying vpon their mouth rotten stickes, which they couer with earth, and strawe vppon it herbes, and when the beare commeth to the Apple tree, she falleth into the pit and is taken. The herbe Wolfebanie or Libardine is poison to Foxes, Wolues, Dogs, and Beares, and to all beasts that are littered blind, as the Alpine Rhaetians affirme. There is one kinde of this called Cyclamine, which the Valdensians call Tora, and with the iuice thereof they poi∣son their darts, whereof I haue credibly receiued this story; That a certain Valdensian, see∣ing a wilde beare hauing a dart poysond heere with, did cast it at the beare being farre from him, and lightly wounded her, it being no sooner done, but the beare ran too and fro in a wonderfull perplexitie through the woods, vnto a verie sharpe cliffe of a rocke, where the man saw her draw her last breath, as soone as the poison had entered to her hart, as he afterward found by opening of her bodie. The like is reported of henbane, another herb: But there is a certaine blacke fish in Armenia full of poison, with the pouder whereof they poison figs, Aelianus and cast them in those places where wilde beastes are most plentifull, which they eat and so are killed. Concerning the industrie or naturall disposition of a beare, it is certaine that they are very hardlie tamed, and not to bee trusted though they seeme neuer so tame; for which cause there is a storie of Diana in Lysias, that there vvas a certaine beare made so tame, that it vvent vppe and dovvne among men and vvoulde feed vvith them, taking meat at their handes, giuing no occasion to feare or mistrust her cruelty: on a daye, a young mayde playing with the Beare, lasciuiously did so prouoke it, that he tore her in pieces; the Virgins brethren seeing the murther, with their Dartes slew the Beare, whereupon followed a great pestilence through all that region: and when they consul∣ted with the Oracle, the payn in God gaue answeare, that the plague could not cease; vn∣till they dedicated some virginnes vnto Diana for the Beares sake that was slaine; which some interpreting that they should sacrifice them: Embarus vpon condition the priest-hoode might remaine in his family, slewe his onely daughter to end the pestilence, and for this cause the virgins were after dedicated to Diana before their mariage, when they were betwixt ten and fifteene yeare olde, which was performed in the moneth of Ianuary, otherwise they could not be married: yet beares are tamed for labours, and especially for sports among the Roxolani and Libians, being taught to draw water with wheeles out of the deepest wels; likewise stones vpon sleds to the building of wals. Albertus. A prince of Lituania nourished a Beare very tenderly, feeding her from his table with his owne hand, for he had vsed her to be familiar in his court, and to come into his owne chamber when he listed, so that she would goe abroad into the fields and woods, retur∣ning home againe of her owne accord, and would with her hand or foote rub the Kinges chamber doore to haue it opened, when she was hungry, it being locked: it happened that certaine young Noble men conspired the death of this Prince, A History and came to his chamber doore, rubbing it after the custome of the beare, the King not doubting anye euill, and supposing it had bene his beare, opened the doore, and they presently slewe him. There is a fable of a certaine wilde beare of huge stature, Caelius which terrified all them that looked vppon her, the which Pythagoras sent for, and kept to himselfe, verie familiarly vsing to stroke and milke her; at the length when he was wearie of her, he whispered in hir eare and bound her with an oath, that being departed she shuld neuer more harm any liuing thing, which saith the fable, she obserued to her dying day. These beares care not for any thing that is dead, and therefore if a man can hold his breath as if he were deade, they will not harme him, which gaue occasion to Esope to fable of two companions and sworn friends, who trauelling togither met with a beare, wher at they being amazed, one of them ranne away and gate vp into a tree, the other fell downe and counterfetted him∣selfe dead, vnto whome the beare came and smelt at his nostrils and eares for breath, but perceiuing none departed without hurting him: soone after the other friend came down from the tree, and merrily asked his companion what the beare saide in his eare, marrye (quoth he) she warnd me that I should neuer trust such a fugitiue frend as thou art, which diddest forsake me in my greatest necessity: thus far Esop. They will bury one another being dead, as Tzetzes affirmeth, and it is receiued in ma∣ny Nations, that children haue bene Nursed by beares: Parris throwne out of the cittie, Varrinus. was nourished by a Beare. There is in Fraunce a Noble house of the Vrsons, whose firste founder is reported to haue bene certaine yeares togither nourished by a beare, and for that cause was called Vrson: and some affirme, that Arcesius was so being deceiued by the name of his mother who was called Arctos, a beare: as amonge the Latines was Vrsula. And it is reported in the yeare of our Lord 1274. that the Concubine of Pope Nicholas (being with childe as was supposed) brought forth a young Beare, which she did not by any vnlawful copulation with such a beast, but onely with the most holy pope; Sebast. frāk: and con∣ceiued such a creature, by strength of imagination, lying in his pallace, where she sawe the picturs of many bears; so that the holy father being first put in good hope of a son, & afterward seeing this monster (like himselfe Reuel. 13.) for anger and shame defaced all his pictures of those beasts. There is a mountaine called the mountaine of beares in Cy∣zicus, betwixt Chersonesus and Propontus ; so called, because as some haue affirmed, Helice and Cynosura were turned into beares in that place, but the reason is more probable, be∣cause it was full of beares, or else because it was so high that it seemd to touch the Beare -starre. There is a constellation called the beare in the figure of seauen Starres like a Carte, whereof foure stande in the place of the wheeles, and three in the roome of Horsses. The Septentrions call them Triones, Higinus. that is yoked Oxen. But there are two beares, a greater and a lesser. The greater is called Callisto after the name of Lytaons daughter, who raigned in Arcadia, whereof many giue diuers reasons. For they say Callisto was a companion of Diana, & vsed to hunt with her being verie like vnto her, and one day Iupiter came to her in the likenes of Diana and deflowred her, and when she was with childe, Diana asked her how that happened, to whom Callisto answeared, that it happened by her fact: wherewith the Goddesse being angry, turnd her into a beare, in which shape she brought forth Arcas, and they both wandring in the woodes, were taken and brought for a presente vnto Lycaon her father; And vpon a day the beare being ignorant of the law, entered into the temple of Iu∣piter Lycaeus, and her sonne followed her, for which the Arcadians would haue slaine them both, but Iupiter in pittie of them tooke them both into heauen and placed them among the starres. Other say that Callisto was turned into a beare by Iuno, whom afterward Diana slew, and comming to knowledge that it was Callisto, she placed her for a signe in heauen, which is called Vrsa Maiore, the great beare; which before that time was called Hamaxa : but the rea∣son of these fables is rendred by Palaephatus, because that Callistus going into a Beares den was by the beare deuoured, and so her foolish companions seeing none come foorth but the Beare, fondly imagined that the Virgin was turned into a beare. There is another constellation next to the great Beare, called Arctophylax, Bootes, or the little beare, in whose girdle is a bright starre called Arcturus, and from this constella∣tion of beares, commeth the denomination of the Artique and Antarctique pole. Other affirme, that the two Beares were Helice and Cynosura, the two Nurses of Iupiter, because sometime they are so named; the cause whereof is apparant in the Greeke tongue, for He∣lice is a starre, hauing as it were a taile roled vp, and cynosura, a taile at length like a Dogge. They are also nourished for sport, for as their bodies doe in one sort resemble Apes, so do also their dispositions being apt to sundrie gestures and pastimes, lying vpon their backes, and turning their hands and feete, rocke themselues vpon them as a woman rocketh her childe in a cradle; but principallie for fight: for which occasion they were preserued of old time by the Romaines: For when Messala was Consull, Aenobarbus Domitius presented in one ring or circle, an hundred Beares, and so many hunters with them. Rabido nec proditus ore: Fumantem nasum viui tentaueris vrsi, Sit placidus licet, & lambat digitosque manusque: Si dolor et bilis, si iust a coegerit ira, Vrsus erit vacua dentes in pelle fatiges. They will not willinglie fight with a man, although men may do it without hurt, for if they annoint or sprinkle the mouthes of Lyons or Beares with Vitrioll or copperas, it will so bind their chappes togither, that they shall not be able to bite, which caused Martiall to write thus: Praeceps sanguinea dum se rotat vrsus arena, Splendida iam tecto cessent venabula ferro: Deprendat vacuo venator in aere praedam, Implicitam visco perdidit ille fugam: Nec volet excussa lancea torta manu, Si captare feras aucupis arte placet. Alexander had a certaine Indian dog giuen vnto him, to whom was put a bore and a beare to fight withall, but he disdaining them, woulde not once regard them, but when a Lyon came, Fight of Beares. he rose vp and fought with him. Beares, they wil fight with Buls, Dogges, and hor∣ses: when they fight with bulles, they take them by their hornes, and so with the weight of their bodie, they wearie and presse the beast, vntill they may easilie slaie him: and this fight is for the most part on his backe. A Rhinoceros set on by a bear in a publicke spectacle at Rome, did easilie cast him off from the hold he had on his horne. She doth not aduenture on a wilde bore, except the bore be a sleepe or not seeing her. There is also a mortall hatred be∣twixt a horse and a beare, for they know one another at the first sight; and prepare to com∣bat, which they rather act by policie then by strength: The beare falling flat on his backe, the horsse leaping ouer the beare, which pulleth at his guts with her forefeet nailes, and is by the heeles of the horsse wounded to death, if he strike the beare vpon his head. Also beares feare a sea-calfe, and will not fight with them if they can be auoided, for they knowe they shalbe ouercome. Great is the fiercenes of a beare, as appeareth by holie scripture Osee 13. I will meet them as a beare robbed of her whelpes (saith the Lorde) and will teare in pieces their froward heart : And Ch sai telleth Absalon. 2. Sam. 17. Thou knowest that thy father and the men that bee with him be most valiant and fierce like a shee beare robbed of her Whelpes: for a shee beare is more couragious then a male. There is a filthy nation of men called Taifah, who are giuen vnto a sodomiticall bug∣gery, to commit vncleanenes man with man, and especially with young boyes; but if any of them take a wilde bore, or kill a Beare, he shall be exempted from this kind of beastly impudicitie. Heliogabalus was woont to shut vp his drunken friends togither, and suddenly in the night would put in among them Beares, Wolues, Lyons, and Leo∣pards, muzled and disarmed, so that when they did awake, they should find such cham∣ber fellowes, as they could not behold (if darkenesse did not blind them) without singu∣lar terror; whereby manie of them fell into swoundes, sickenesse, extasie, and madnes. Vitoldus King of Lituania, kept certaine Beares of purpose, to whom he cast all per∣sons which spoke against his tirranie, putting them first of all into a Beares skinne; Aeneas Sil whose crueltie was so great, that if he had commaunded anie of them to hang themselues, they would rather obey him then endure the terror of his indignation. In like sort did Alexan∣der Phaeraeus, deale with his subiects, as is reported by Textor Valentintanus, the Emperor nourished two beares deuourers of men, one of them called golden Mica, the other Inno∣centia ; which he lodged neere his owne chamber: at length after many slaughters of men, he let Innocentia goe loose in the wooddes for her good deserts, in bringing so ma∣ny people to their funerals. There are many naturall operations in Beares. Pliny reporteth, that if a woman bee in sore trauile of child-birth, let a stone or arrow which hath killed a man, a beare or a bore, Secrets ob∣serued of Beares. be throwne ouer the house wherein the Woman is, and she shall be eased of her paine. There is a small worme called Voluox, which eateth the vine branches when they are yong, but if the vine-seckles be annointed with Beares blood, that worme will neuer hurt them. Collumella If the blood or greace of a Beare be set vnder a bed, it will draw vnto it all the fleas, and so kill them by cleauing thereunto. But the vertues medicinall are very many: Arnoldus. Virtues me∣dicinall. and first of all, the blood cureth all manner of bunches and apostems in the flesh, and bringeth haire vpon the eye-lids if the bare place be annointed therewith. The fat of a Lyon is most hot and dry, and next to a Lyons, a Leopards; next to a Leo∣pards, a Beares; and next to a Beares, a buls. The later Physitians vse it to cure conuulsed and distracted parts, spots, and tumors in the body. It also helpeth the paine of the loins, if the sicke part be annointed therewith, and all vlcers in the legges or shinnes, when a plaister is made thereof with bole-armoricke. Also the vlcers of the feet, mingled with al∣lome. It is soueraigne against the falling of the haire, compounded with wilde roses. he Spaniards burne the braines of beares when they die in any publicke sports, holding them venemous, because being drunke, they driue a man to be as mad as a beare; and the like is reported of the heart of a Lyon, and the braine of a cat. The right eie of a beare dried to pouder, and hung about childrens neckes in a little bag, driueth away the terrour of dreames, and both the eyes whole, bound to a mans left arme, easetha quartanague. The liuer of a sow, a lamb, and a bear put togither, and trod to pouder vnder ones shoos, easeth and defendeth cripples from imflamation: the gall being preserued and warmed in water, deliuereth the bodie from colde, when all other medicine faileth. Some giue it mixt with Water, to them that are bitten with a mad Dogge, holding it for a singular re∣medie, if the party can fast three daies before. It is also giuen against the palsie, the Kings euill, the falling sickenesse, an old cough, the inflamation of the eies, the running of the eares, the difficultie of vrine, and deliuery in child-birth, the Haemorrhods, the weaknes of the backe. The stones in a perfume, are good against the falling euill, and the palsie, and that women may go their full time, they make ammulets of Bears nails, and cause them to weare them all the time they are vvith child. OF THE BEAVER. Male and Female. A Beuer is caled in Greeke Ca∣stor, Of the name in Latine Fiber, in Itali∣an Biuaro or Biuero, and Il castoreo, S taticus. in Spanish castor: in French Bieure, & some time castor, in Illyrian, Bobr, in Germaine Biber, all which wordes at the first sight seeme to be de∣riued from the Latine: There is no certain word for it in Hebrew: in Ara∣bia it is called Albedne∣ster: it is also called in La∣tine canis Ponticus, but ca∣nis fluuatilis is another beast, as we shall manifest in the succeding discours of an Otter: and the rea∣son why in Latin it is cal∣led Fibar is, The notatiō of Fibutirom t Latine. because (as Varro saieth) it coueteth the sides, banks, or extre∣mities of the riuer, as the extremities or lappes of the eare and liuer, are cal∣led fibrae, and the skirts of garments fimbriae: The notatiō of the Greek word Castor but the reason why the Graecians call it Castor, is not as the Latines haue supposed, because it biteth off his owne stones, quasicastan∣dro seipsum, as shalbe ma∣nifested soone after, but of castrando, bicause for the stones therof it is hun¦ted and killed, or rather of Gaster signifieng a belly, for that the body is long and almost all belly; or ra∣ther bicause of the colour and ill sauour thereof This Beauer is no other then that which Aristotle calleth Latax, What matter . and it diffe∣reth from an Otter only in the tayle. Some com∣pare a Beauer with a Bad∣ger, but they attribute to him a longer body and smoother hayre, but shorter and softer than a Badgers: their colour is somewhat yellow and white, aspersed with ash-colour, which stande out be∣yonde the shorter hayres, double their length: they are neat and soft like vnto an Otters, and the haires length of the one and others colour, is not aequall. Some haue seen them brown declining to blacke, which Albertus preferreth; & Siluius affirmeth, that his long hayres are like a Dogs, Countrey of breed. and the short ones like an Otter. They are most plentifull in Pontus, for which cause it is called canis Ponticus ; they are also bred in the Ry∣uers of Spaine, and in the riuer Marne in Fraunce, Padus in Italy, in Sauoy, in the Riuers Isara and Rhoan, and in the Island called camargo, and in Heluetia, neere Arula, Vrsa and Limagus : Albertus. Like∣wise throughout all Germany, Polonia, Sclauonia, Rushia and Prussia : & there are Beuers in the woods of Mosco and Lituania, of excellent perfection and stature aboue others, hauing longer white haires which glister aboue other. These beasts liue both in the water and on the land, for in the day time they keepe the water, They are lād & water bea. and in the nigh they keepe the land, and yet without water they cannot liue, for they do participate much of the nature of fishes, as may be well considered by their hinder legs and taile. Their quantitie is not much bigger then a countrey Dog, their head short, their ears very small and round, their teeth very long, Their seueral partes, Siluius. Bellouius. the vnder teethe standing out beyond their lips three fingers breadth, and the vpper about halfe a finger, being very broade, croo∣ked, strong and sharpe, standing or growing double verie deep in their mouth, bending compasse like the edge of an Axe, and their colour yellowish red, wherwith they defend themselues against beasts, take fishes as it were vpon hooks, and will gnaw insunder trees as big as a mans thigh: they haue also grinding teeth very sharpe, wherein are certaine wrinckles or foldes, so that they seeme to be made for grinding some hard substance, for with them they eate the rindes or barke of trees; wherefore the bitinge of this beast is very deepe, being able to crash asunder the hardest bones, and commonly he neuer lo∣seth his holde vntill he feeleth his teeth gnash one against another. Pliny and Solinus af∣firme, that the person so bitten cannot be cured, except he hear the crashing of the teeth which I take to be an opinion without truth. They haue certaine haires about their mouth, which seeme in their quantity or big∣nesse to be rather horne they are so hard, but their bones are most harde of all and with∣out marrow: Their forefeet are like a Dogs, and their hinder like a Gooses, made as it were of purpose to go on the land, & swim in the water; but the taile of this beast is most strange of all in that it commeth nearest to the nature of fishes, being without hayre and couered ouer with a skin like the scales of fish, it being like a soale, and for the most part six fingers broade and halfe a foot long, which some haue affirmed the beast neuer pul∣leth out of the water; whereas it is manifest, that when it is very colde or the water fro∣zen he pulleth it vp to his body, although Agricola affirme, that his hinder legs and taile freeze with the water; and no lesse vntrue is the assertion, that they compell the Otter in time of colde and frost, to wait vpon their taile and to trouble the water so that it may not freeze round about them; but yet the Beuer holdeth the Otter in subiection, and eyther ouercommeth it in fight, or killeth it with his teeth. This taile he vseth for a sterne when he swimmeth after fishe to catch them. There hath beene taken of them whose tayles haue waied foure pound waight, and they are ac∣counted a very delicate dish, for being dressed they eate like Barbles: they are vsed by the Lotharingians and Sauoyens for meat allowed to be eaten on fish-daies, although the bo∣dy that beareth them be flesh and vncleane for food. Bellonius. The manner of their dressing is, first roasting, and afterward seething in an open pot, that so the euill vapour may go away, and some in pottage made with Saffron; other with Ginger, and many with Brine: it is cer∣taine that the tayle and forefeet tast very sweet, from whence came the Prouerbe, That sweet is that fish, which is not fishe at all. These Beastes vse to builde them Caues or Dens neere the Waters, so as the Water may come into them, Their build∣ing of Dens. or else they may quickly leape into the water, and their wit or natu∣rall inuention in building of their caues is most wonderfull: for you must vnderstand that in the night time they go to land, and there with their teeth gnaw down boughes & trees which they likewise bite verie short fitting their purpose, and so being busied about this worke, they will often looke vp to the tree when they perceiue it almost asunder, thereby to discerne when it is ready to fall, least it might light vpon their owne pates: the tree be∣ing down and prepared, they take one of the oldest of their company, whose teeth could not be vsed for the cutting, (or as others say, they constraine some strange Beauer whom they meet withall) to fall flat on his backe (as before you haue heard the Badgers doe) and vpon his belly lade they all their timber, which they so ingeniously worke and fasten in∣to the compasse of his legs that it may not fall, and so the residue by the taile, drawe him to the water side, where these buildings are to be framed, and this the rather seemeth to be true, Albertus. Olaus mag: because there haue bene some such taken, that had no haire on their backes: but were pilled, which being espied by the hunters, in pitty of their slauery, or bondage, they haue let them go away free. These beasts are so constant in their purpose, that they will neuer change the tree that they haue once chosen to build withall▪ how long time so euer they spend in biting downe the same, it is likewise to be obserued, that they neuer go to the same, during the time of their labour but in one and the same path, and so in the same, returne to the water againe. When they haue thus brought their wood togither, then dig they a hole or ditch in the banke side, Albertus. where they vnderset the earth to beare it vp from falling, with the aforesaide timber: a secret and so they proceed, making two or three roomes like seuerall chambers, one aboue another, to the entent that if the water rise they may goe further, and if it fall they may discend vnto it. And as the husbandmen of Egypt doe obserue the buildings of the Crocodile, so do the inhabitants of the countrey where they breed, obserue the Beauers, that when they build high, they may expect an inundation and sowe on the Mountaines, and when they build lowe, they looke for a calme or drought, and plow the valleys. There is nothing so worthy in this beast as his stones, for they are much sought after and desi∣red by all Merchants, so that they will giue for them any great price. There is both in Male and Female, certaine bunches vnder their bellie as great as a gooses egge, which some haue vnskilfully taken for their coddes, and betweene these is the secret or priuie part of both sexes; which tumours or bunches are nothing else, but a little fleshie bagge within a thin skinne, in the middle whereof is a hole or passage, out of the which the beast sucketh a certaine liquor, The Cods or stones of the beast Rondoletius. and afterward therewith annointeth euery part of her bodie that she can reach with her toong. Now it is verie plain that these bun∣ches are not their coddes, for these reasons; because that there is no passage either of the seed into them, or from them into the yarde: Besides, their stones are found within their bodie; neither ought this to seeme strange, seeing that Hares haue the like bunches, and also the Moschus or Musk-cat : the female hath but one passage for all her excrements, and to conceiue or bring forth young ones. It hath beene an opinion of some, that when a Beauer is hunted and is in danger to be taken, she biteth off her owne stones, The Beauer doth not bite off her owne stones. knowing that for them only her life is sought, which caused Alciatus to make this Emblem.

Teaching by the example of a Beauer, to giue our pursse to theeues, rather then our liues, and by our wealth to redeeme our danger, for by this meanes the Beauer often es∣capeth. There haue beene many of them founde that wanted stones, which gaue some strength to this errour, but this was exploded in auncient time for a fable; and in this and all other honest discourses of any part of Phylosophy, the onely marke wherat eue∣rie good student and professor ought to ayme, must be veritie and not tales: wherin ma∣ny of the ancient haue greatly offended (as is manifested by Marcellius Virgilius ) especi∣ally Plato : and this poison hath also crept into and corrupted the whole bodie of religi∣on. The Egyptians in opinion of the aforesaid Castration, when they will signifie a man that hurteth himselfe, they picture a Beauer biting off his owne stones. Herus. an Emblem. But this is most false, as by Sertius, Plinius, Dioscorides, and Albertus, is manifested: first, because their stones are verie small, and so placed in their bodie as are a Boares, and therefore impos∣sible for them to touch or come by them: Secondly, they cleaue so fast vnto their back, that they cannot be taken awaie but the beast must of necessitie loose his life; and there∣fore ridiculous is their relation, who likewise affirme, that when it is hunted (hauing for∣merlie bitten off his stones, that he standeth vpright and sheweth the hunters that he hath none for them, and therefore his death cannot profit them, by meanes whereof they are auerted, and seeke for another. These Beauers eate fish, fruits, and the bitter rhindes of trees, Their food which are vnto them most delicate, especiallie Alderne, Poplar, and Willowe; wherevpon it is prouerbiallie said, of one that serueth another for gaine: Sic me subes quotidie vt fiber salicem, you loue me as the Beauer doth the Willow, which eateth the barke and destroieth the tree. They are taken for their skins, tailes, and cods, and that manie waies; Their cause of taking and first of all when their caues are found, there is made a great hole or breach therein, wherinto is put a little dog, which the beast espying, flieth to the end of her denne, and there defendeth her selfe by her teeth, till all her structure or building be rased, and she laide open to her enimies, who with such instruments as they haue present, beat her to death: A secret. some affirm that she rouzeth vp her body and by the strong sauour of hir stones she driueth away the Dogs, which may be probable if the stones could be seene. These dogges are the same which hunt wilde foule and Otters. It is reported that in Prussia they take them in bow-nets, baited with the rinde of trees, Agricola. where into they enter for the food, but being entrapped cannot go forth againe. They cannot diue long time vnder water but must put vp their heads for breath, which being espied by them that beset them, they kill them with gun-shot, or pierce them with Ot∣ter-speares, so that one would thinke seeing such a one in the water, that it was some hai∣ry kind of fish; and his nature is, if he heare any noise to put his head aboue water, wher∣by he is discouered and looseth his life. His skin is pretious in Polonia either for garment or for gloues, but not so pretious as an Otters, yet is it vsed for the edging of all other fur-garments making the best shew and enduring longest; they are best that are blackest, and of the bellies which are like felt wooll, they make caps and stockings, against raine and foule weather. The medicinall vertues of this beast are in the skin, the vrine, the gall and the cods: The medici∣nall vertues; Albertus. Aetius. and first, a garment made of the skinnes is good for a paralitick person, and the skinnes burned with drie Oynions and liquid pitch, stayeth the bleeding of the nose, and being put into the soles of shooes easeth the gowt. The vrine preserued in the bladder, is an antidot against poyson, and the gall is profitable for many thinges, Pliny but especially being turned into a glew it helpeth the falling euill. The genitals of a Beauer are called by the Phisitians Castoreum, Pliny. and therefore we will in this discourse vse that word for expressing the nature, qualities, remedies, and miraculous operation therof, wherfore they must be verie warily and skilfully taken foorth, for there is in a little skin compassing them about a certaine sweet humor (called Humor Melleus ) and with that they must be cut out, the vt∣ter skin being cut asunder to make the more easie entrance, and the Apothecaries vse to take all the fat about them, which they put into the oyle of the Castoreum, and sell it vnto fisher men to make baite for fishes. The females haue stones or Castoreum, as well as the males, but very small ones. Now you must take great heed to the choise of your Beauer, and then to the stones which must grow from one roote conioyned, otherwise they are not precious, and the beast must neither be a young one nor one very old, but in the meane betwixt both, being in vigour and perfection of strength. The Beauers of Spaine yeeld not such vertuous castoreum as they of Pontus, and there∣fore if it be possible, Hermolaus. The corrup∣ting of Ca∣storeum. take a Pontique Beauer, next one of Gallatia, and lastly of Affrique. Some do corrupt them putting into their skinne gumme and Ammomacke with blood, o∣ther take the raines of the beast, and so make the castoreum very big, which in it selfe is but small. This beast hath two bladders, which I remember not are in any other liuing crea∣ture, and you must beware that none of these be ioyned with the castoreum. You may know if it be mingled with Ammoniacke by the tast, for although the colour be like, yet is the sauour different. Platearius sheweth, that some adulterate castoreum, by taking of his skinne, or some cod newly taken forth of another beast, filling it with blood, sinnewes and the pouder of castoreum, that so it may not want his strong smell or sauour: other fill it with earth and blood; other with blood, rozen, gumme, sinnewes and pepper, to make it tast sharp: but this is a falsification discernable, and of this sort is the castoreum that is sold at Venice, as Brasouala affirmeth: and the most of them sold at this day are bigger then the true castoreum, for the iust waight of the right stones is not aboue twelue ounces and a halfe, one of them being bigger then the other, being sixe fingers bredth long, and foure in breadth. Now the substance contained in the bag is yellowish, solid like wa , and stick∣ing like glew, not sharp and cracking betwixt the teeth (as the counterfait is.) These stones are of a strong and stinking sauour, such as is not in any other, but not rotten and sharpe as Grammarians affirme; yet I haue smelled of it dried, which was not vnpleasaunt, and things once seasoned with the sauour thereof, will euer tast of it, although they haue not touched it, but lie couered with it in the same boxe or pot; and therefore the castoreum of Persia is counterfeit, which hath no such smell, for if a man smell to the right castoreum, it will draw blood out of his nose. After it is taken forth from the beast, it must be hung vp in some place to be dried in the shadow, and when it is dry, it is soft and white: it will continue in strength sixe yeares, and some say seuen; the Persians affirme, that their castoreum will hold his vertue ten years; which is as false as the matter they speake of is counterfait. Archigenes wrote a whole booke of the vertue of this castoreum, whereunto they may resort, that require an exact and full declaration of all his medicinall operations: it shall onely be our purpose, to touch some generall heads, and not to enter into a particular discouery thereof. Being so dried as is declared, it must be warily vsed, for it falleth out heerein as in o∣ther medicinall subiects, that ignorance turneth a curing herbe or substance, into a vene∣mous and destructiue quality; therefore we will first of all set downe the daungers to be auoyded, and afterward some particular cures that come by the right vse of it. Therefore it must be vnderstood, that there is poyson in it, not naturally, but by accident; as may be in any other good and wholsome matter: and that especially in the smell or sauor ther∣of, The dangers in the vse of Castoreum. Seruius. whereunto if a woman with childe doe smell, it vvill kill the child vnborne and cause abortement: for a vvomans womb is like a creature, nourished with good sauors, and de∣stroyed with euill: therefore burning of fethers, shoo-soles, wollen clothes, pitch, Galba∣num, gumme, onions, and garlike is noysome to them. It may be corrupted not onely as is before declared; but also, if it be shut vp close without vent into pure aner, when it is hanged vp to be dried, or if the bag be kept moyst, so that it cannot dry; and it is true (as Auicen saith) that if it be vsed being so corrupted, it killeth within a daies space, dri∣uing one into madnesse, making the sicke person continually to hold forth his tongue, and infecting him with a feuer by inflaming the bodie, loosing the continuitie of the partes, through sharp vapours arising from the stomack: and for a proofe that it will inflame, if you take a little of it mingled with oyle, and rubbe vpon any part of the bodie, or vpon your naile, you shall feele it. But there is also a remedie for it being corrupted; namelie, Asses milke mingled with some sharpe sirrop of Citron, or if need require, drinke a dram of Philons Antidot at the most, or take butter and sweet water which will cause vomit, and vomit therewith so long, as you feele the sauour of the stone, and afterward take sirrop of Limmons or citrons: & some affirme vpon experience, that two penny waight of Coriander-seed, scorched in the fire, is a present remedy for this euill. And it is more straunge, that seeing it is in greatest strength, when the sauor is hottest, which is very displeasing to a mans nature in outward appearance, yet doeth it neuer harme a man taken inwardly, (being pure and rightly compounded] if the person be without a feuer, for in that case onely it doeth hurte in∣wardly, otherwise apply it to a moist body lacking refrigeration, or to a colde body wan∣ting excalfaction, or to a colde and moist body, you shall perceiue an euident commo∣dity thereby, if there bee no feuer: and yet it hath profited many where the feuer hath not bene ouerhot, as in extasies and lethargies, ministred with white pepper, and mel∣licrate, and with Rose cakes laid to the necke or head. The same vertues it hath being out∣wardly applied and mingled with oyle, if the bodies be in any heate, and purely without oile, if the body be cold, for in heating it holdeth the thirde degree, and in drying the se∣cond. The maner how it is to be ministred is in drink, for the most part, the sweet lickor being taken from it, and the little skinnes appearing therein clensed away, and so it hath among many other these operations following. Drunke with vineger, it is good against al venim of Serpents, and against the chamelaeon, but with this difference, against the scor∣pion with wine, against spiders with sweet water, against the Lizzards with Mirtire, against Dipsas and cerastes, with Opponax, or wine made of Rew, and against other serpentes with wine simply. Take of euery one two drams, for a cold take it a scruple and a halfe in foure cups of wine, vsed with Ladanum, it cureth the Fistula and vlcers, Castoreo{que} graui mulier sopita recum bit. prouoketh neezing by smelling to it, procureth sleepe, they being annointed with it: maiden-weed & conserue of Roses, and being drunke in Water, helpeth Phrensie, and with the roses and Maiden-weed aforesaid, easeth head-ache: Being layd to the head like a plaster, it cureth all colde and windy affections therein, or if one drawe in the smoake of it perfumed, though the paine be from the mothers wombe, and giuen in three cups of sweete vineger fasting, it helpeth the falling sicknes, but if the person haue often fits, the same giuen in a glister, gi∣ueth great ease: Then must the quantity be two drams of castoreum, one sextary of honey and oyle, and the like quantity of water, but in the fit it helpeth with vineger by smelling to it. It helpeth the palsie, taken with Rew or wine▪ sod in Rew, so also all heart trembling, ache in the stomack, and quaking of the sinewes. It being infused into them that lie in Le∣thargies with vineger and conserue of roses doth presently awake them, for it strength∣neth the braine, and mooueth sternutation. It helpeth obliuion comming by reason of sicknes, the party being first purgd with Hiera Ruffi▪ castoreum▪ with oyle bound to the hin∣der part of the head, and afterward a dram drunke with Mellicrate, also taken with oyle, cureth all conuulsion proceeding of cold humors, if the conuulsion be full and perfect, & not temporall or in some particular member, which may come to passe in any sicknes. The same mixed with hony helpeth the clearnes of the eies, and their inflamations: likewise vsed with the iuyce of Popie, and infused to the eares, or mixed with honey, hel∣peth all paines in them. With the seed of hemlockes beaten in vineger, it sharpneth the sence of hearing, if the cause be colde, and it cureth tooth-ach infused into that eare with oyle on which side the paine resteth; for Hippocrates sent vnto the wife of Aspasius [com∣playning of the paine in her cheeke and teeth] a little castoreum with pepper, aduising her to hold it in her mouth betwixt her teeth. A perfume of it drawne vp into the head & sto∣macke, easeth the paines of the lights and intrals, and giuen to them that sigh much with sweet vineger fasting: it recouereth them. It easeth the cough and distillations of rhewme from the head to the stomacke, taken with the iuyce of blacke Popye. It is preseruative a∣gainst inflamations & pains in the guts or belly] although the belly be swolne with colde windy humors,] being drunke with vineger, or Oxycrate, it easeth the colicke giuen vvith annisse beaten smal, and two spoonfuls of sweet water: and it is found by experiment, that vvhen a horsse cannot make vvater, let him be couered ouer vvith his cloath, Vegetins. and then put vnderneath him a fire of coles, vvherein make a perfume vvith that castoreum till the hor∣ses belly and cods smell thereof, then taking avvay the coles, vvalk the horsse vp & dovvn couered, and he vvill presently stale. To soften the belly they vse Castoreum with sweet water two drams, and if it be not for∣cible enough, they take of the root of a set cucumber one dram, and the some of salt Peter two drams. It is also vsed with the iuice of Withy and decoction of Vineger applied to the rains and genitall parts like a plaster against the Gonorrhaean passion. It will stir vp a wo∣mans monethly courses, and cause an easie trauaile, two drammes being drunke in water with Penny-Royall. And if a Woman with childe goe ouer a Beauer, she will suffer abort∣ment, A secret and Hypocrates affirmeth, that a perfume made with Castoreum, Asses dunge, and swines greace, openeth a closed wombe. There is an Antidot called Diacostu, made of this castoreum, good against the Me∣grim, falling sicknesse, apoplexies, palsies, and weakenesse of limmes, as may be seene in Myrepsus : against the impotency of the tongue, trembling of the members, and other such infirmities. These vertues of a Beauer thus described, I will conclude this discourse with a History of a strange beast like vnto this: related by Dunranus campus-bellus (a noble kni.) who affirmed, A miraculus history of a Monster. that there are in Arcadia, seuen great Lakes, some 30. miles compasse, and some lesse; whereof one is called Garloil, out of which in Anno 15.0 about the midst of Summer, in a morning, came a Beast about the bignes of a water dog, hauing feet like a Goose, who with his taile easily threw downe small trees, and presently with a swift pace he made after some men that he saw, and with three strokes he likewise ouerthrew three of them, the residue climbing vp into trees escaped, and the beast without any long tarrying, returned backe againe into the water, which beast hath at other times bene seene, and it is obserued, that this appearance of the monster, did giue warning of some strange euils vp∣on the Land: which story is recorded by Hector Boethius. OF THE BISON. Of the name A Bison called of some Latines though corruptly Vrson, and Veson, of the Graecians Bisoon, of the Lituanians Suber, of the Polonians Zuber, from whence some Latines deriued Zubro, for a Byson. Of the Germanes Visent, and Vaesent, & Wisent: a beast very strange as may appear by his figure prefixed▪ which by many authors is taken for Vr. , some for a Bugle, or wild Oxe, other, for Rangifer, and many for the beast Tarandus a Buffe. By reason whereof there are not many things, which can by infallible collection be lear∣ned of this beast among the writers; yet is it truely and ge∣nerally held for a kind of wild Oxe, Places of their breed. bred in the Northern parts of the world for the most part, and neuer tamed, as in Scythia, Moscouia, Hercynia, Thracia, and Brussia. But those tall wilde Oxen which are said to be in Lapponia, Philostephan: The reason of their nam. and the Dukedome of Angermannia, are more truely saide to be Vrt, as in their story shall be afterward declared Their name is taken from Thracia, Ʋarinus. Stephanus a secret in the la e Di∣caea which was once called Bistonia, and the people thereof Bistones, from Bisto the sonne of Cicas and Terpsicores ; and thereof came Bistonia Grues, cranes of Thracia, and Bistonia L eus, for the lake or sea of Dicaea, neere Abdera, where neuer liuing thinge, or other of lesse weight was cast in, but it presently sunke and was drowned. This Bison is called Taurus Paeonicus, the Paeonian -Bull, whereof I find two kinds, one of greater, Seural kinds and another of lesser size, called the Scotian or calydonian Bison, whereof you shall see the picture and qualities at the foot of this history. The greater is as big as any Bull or Oxe, being maned about the necke and backe like a Lyon, and hath haire hanging downe vnder his chin or neather lip like a large beard: and a rising or little ridge downe along his face, beginning at the height of his head, and con∣tinuing to his nose very hairy; the great Bi∣son his hornes great and very sharpe, yet turning vp towardes his back & at the points hooked like the wild goats of the alps, but much greater: they are black of colour, The seuerall parts. and with them throgh the admirable strength of his neck can he tosse into the ayre, a horse and horseman both togither. The strēgth of this beast. They are as big as the Dextarij which are the greatest Stallions of Italy. Their face looketh downewarde, and they haue a straunge strength in their toong, for by licking they grate like a file any indifferent hard substance, the quantity of Bisons. The strength of their tung. but especially they can therewith draw vnto them any man or beast of inferiour condi∣tion, whom by licking they wound to death. Their haire is red, yellow, or black, their eyes very great and terrible; they smell like a Moschus or Musk-cat, and their mane reacheth ouer their shoulders, shaking it irefully when he brayeth; their face or forehead very broad, especially betwixt their hornes, for Sigismund king of Polonia, hauing killed one of them in hunting, stood betwixt his horns, with two other men not much lesser in quantity then himselfe, who was a goodly well pro∣portioned and personable Prince. There are two bunches on his backe, the former neare his shoulders, which is the higher, and the other neare the rumpe, which is somewhat lower. I haue seen the horns of a Byson, which was in the hands of a Gold-smith to lippe with Siluer and Gilt, that it might be fit to drinke in: it did bend like the talant of an Egle or Gryphin, or some raue∣nous bird. The flesh in Summer time is most fat, but it tasteth so much of wild-garlicke, The flesh of this beast. Bonarus. Baro. or ramsens, that it is not pleasant to eat, being full of small vaines and strings, and is ac∣counted a noble and strong kind of flesh: the blood is the most purest in the world, excel∣ling in color any purple, and yet for al that it is so hot that being let forth whē the beast di∣eth, within two houres space it putrifieth, and the flesh it selfe in the coldest winter will not keepe sweet many houres, by reason of the immoderate heate thereof, a secret in the inward heat of this beast. if the Hunter do not presently after the fall of the beast, seperate from it the intrals: and which is most strange of all, being pierced aliue with any hunting speare, dart, or sworde, the weapon by the heate of the body is made so weake and soluble, that it commeth forth as flexible as lead: and to conclude, it is a most noble and fierce spirited beast, neuer afraid, or yeel∣ding till breath fayleth, neither can he be taken with any nettes or ginnes, vntill they be thoroughly wearied: Wherefore they which hunt him, must bee very strong, nimble, their hūting. and skilfull men, or else that sport will be their owne vndoing and ouerthrow. Sigism: baro. Therefore when they go to hunt this Byson, they choose a place replenished with larg trees, neither so great that they cannot easily wind about them, nor so little that they shal not be able to couer theyr bodyes from the horne or tongue of the beast: behinde which the hunters place themselues out of sight: and then the Dogges rouze vp the beast, dri∣uing him to that place where the hunters stand, whome the beast first espieth, to him hee maketh force, who must warily keepe the tree for his sheild, and with his speare wounde him where hee can, who will not fall without many mortall strokes, but waxe more and more eager, not onely with horne but with tongue, for if he can but apprehend any part of the hunters garment with his tongue, he looseth no holde but draweth him vnto him, and with his horne and feet killeth him: but if the fight be long, and so the hunter wearied and out of breath, then doth he cast a red cap vnto the beast, who maketh at it with head and feete, neuer leauing till it bee in peeces; and if another come to helpe him as hunters must, if they will returne aliue, then shall he easily draw the beast to combate, and forsake the first man, if he cry Lu-lu-lu. In Phoci is How Bisons are takē aliue Pausanias sheweth how these Bysons are taken aliue, in this sort. The hunters (sayth he) chuse out some steepe and slippery downe hill, whereupon they lay skinnes of beasts new∣ly taken off, and if they want such, then annoint they old skins with oyle, and so leaue them spread vppon those sleeping or bending passages: then raise they the beasts, and with dogs and other means on horseback driue them along to the places where they laid their hides, and as soone as they come vpon the skins they slip and fall downe, rowling heade∣long till they come into the valleys, from whence they constraine them back again some other way, three or foure times a day, making them fall downe the hils as aforesaid, and so wearying them with continual hunting, and fasting. At the last they come vnto them, when they are no more able to rise for faintnes, & giue them pine-Aples taken out of the shels, (for with that meat are they delighted) and so while they eagerly feed and ly weary on the ground, the medicins not knowne, they intoile them in bands and manacles, and lead them away aliue: The medicins comming from this beast may be coniectured to be more forcible, then of common and ordinarie oxen, but because they were not knowne to the Grecians and Arabians, and wee find nothing recorded thereof: we wil conclude the story of this great Bison; with a good opinion of the vertues, though we are not able to learne or discouer them to others. Of the White SCOTIAN Bison. I N the Woods of SCOTLAND, called Callendar or Caldar, Places wher these Bisons abide. & in auncient time CALIDONIA, which reacheth from Mon∣teth and Erunall, vnto Atholia and Loquhabria, there are bred white Oxen, maned about the necke like a Lyon, but in other parts like ordinary and common Oxen. This wood was once full of them, but now they are all slaine, The nature of this Bison. except in that parte which is called Cummirnald. This beast is so hatefull and fear∣full of mankind, that it will not feede of that grasse or those hearbes, whereof he sauoureth a man hath touched, no not for many daies togither: and if by art or pollicy they happen to be taken aliue, they will die with very sullen griefe. If they meete a man, presently they make force at him, fearing neither dogs, speares, nor other weapons. Their flesh is very pleasant, though full of sinewes, and very acceptable to the greatest Nobles, for which cause they are now gro∣wen to a small number, their qualities being like to the former beast, excepting their co∣lour and beard, I will tearme them a white calidonian, or Scotian BISON. BONASVS, the figure of the head and HORNES. T His beast is cald in greek Bonassos, Of the name & in Latin Bon¦nassus, and is also called Monops, or Monopios, & once in Aristotle Bolin∣thus. The Bohemians Lo∣ni, now the Germans & Englishe call the long haire about the necke of anye beast, a Maene or Mane, from whence cō∣meth this word Monapi∣os, The reason of the name Monapios which signifieth a maned Oxe. This Bison is the greatest beast, bul or Oxe, though it be shorter in length, yet are the sides larger and broader then all other. Places of their breed. They are bred in Paeonia in the mountaine Messapus, not in Lydia and Phrygia, as Solinus and Albertus haue deliuered; being deceiued, because the Peonians were ioyned with the Medians, which they deriue from Madi a people of Asya, whereas the Peonians and Medi in Pliny, (as is obserued by Hermolaus in his castigations of Pliny ) are a people of Thr cia, in EVROPE; so called of Paeon the sonne of Endimion and brother of Epeus, Pausanias who was sea∣ted neere the riuer AXIVS in Macedonia: for it was agreed betwixt the two brethren stri∣uing for the kingdome, that he which was out runne by the other, should yeeld the king∣dome in quietnesse to his brother. The head of this beast is like the head of an Oxe or Bull, His parts his hornes bending round to the sides of the cheeke, by reason whereof he hath no defence by them, neither can a man be hurt that is cast vpon them. His necke is very thicke with a large mane, Aristotle from his eyes downe to his shoulders in length like a Horses, but the haire thereof is much softer, and lyeth more smoothly, the vppermost haires being harsher, and the vndermost softer like wooll. Their colour betwixt red and ash coulour, but blacke and yellow appeareth not in them; They haue no vpper teeth, in this point resembling an Oxe and other horned beasts: their hornes being in compasse about nine ynches and somewhat more, are verie smooth and blacke like varnish. Their voice is like the voice of an oxe, their legs all hai∣ry, and their feet clouen, their taile too shorte for the other members of the Body like a Bugles, His flesh and disposition to anger. their backe stretched out at length, is as long as a seat for seauen men, their flesh is very sweet, for which cause he is much sought for in hunting, hee will with his feet dig vp the ground like an oxe or bull in his rage, when he is once stroke he flyeth a∣way, His fight in flyeng. fighting with his heeles backward, and whereas nature hath denyed him the bene∣fit of hornes which other beastes haue, so that hee is onely adorned and not armed by those weapons, like a souldiour that cannot draw foorth his sword: she hath giuen him the secret operation of his dung: The secret operation of his dung. which in his chase he casteth forth of his body so plen∣tifully, vpon the Dogges or other that pursue him, by the space of foure paces backe∣ward, that he slayeth their course, and the heat of this dung is so admirable, that it scor∣cheth or burneth the haire or skinne of any beastes or men that hunt him: neither hath this fime such vertuous operation at any other time, but onely when the beast flieth, be∣ing hunted and pursued for life, at other times it lying quiet, there is no such vertue ther∣in: neither ought this to seeme incredible, seeing many other beasts in their chase, haue the like or at the least do then eiect their excrement more plentifully and noisomly then at other times: The reason of the heat & operation of their excre∣ment. as the Cuttell -fi h, for when in chase the intrals are heated, and the passage somewhat restrained, so that the holding in of breath breedeth more wind in the guttes, it may very naturally chaunce, the excrement being with the inclosed wind and heat sent forth by violent eruption that it may flie far backward, and also burne as aforesaid. These beasts calue in the mountaines, Their place and succour for caluing and before that time commeth she chuseth a place, which she walleth in with the abundance of her owne dung, so high as it may couer her younge one, for there is no beast that is naturally so full of excrement as a bonassus. Their eares are very broade as the Poet sayeth, Patutae camuris sub cornibus aures, broad eares, vnder crooked winding blunt hornes, the skinne is so large, that it hath couered a good part of a house, the inward colour whereof is like the earth whereon the beast did vse to feed. That excellent Phisitian of England Iohn Cay, did sende mee the head of this beast, with this description, in an Epistle saying. I Send vnto thee the head of a great wild beast, the bare mouth and the bones supporters of the hornes being very weighty, The relation of Iohn Cay a Doctor of Physick in England and therefore bearing vp some like heauy burden, the hornes are recurued and bending backward, so that they do not spire directly downe∣ward but rather forward, though in a crooked manner, which because it could not appear forward, as they doe when the Beast is aliue, therefore they are described turning on the one side: the space betwixt the hornes or bredth of the forehead is three Roman palmes and halfe, the length of the hornes, three palmes one finger and a half, and their compas where they are ioyned to the head, is one foot, one palme and a halfe. In the castle of war∣wicke where are preserued the armor and speare of one Earle Guy of Warwicke a most valiant strong man, I haue seene the heade of a beast not vnlike to this, sauing that if the bones whereon the hornes grow should be ioyned together, then would the hornes bee longer, and of another crooked fashion: And in the same place there is also the necke bone of the same beast, the compasse there of is at the least three Roman feet, two palmes, and a halfe, whereunto I may also adde that shoulder-blade which hangeth on the North gate of the citty of Couentry, being in the lowest part three foot broad and two fingers, and four foot long and two palmes: and the compasse of the arme-hole wherein the shoulder is ioy∣ned, is three foote and one palme, and the whole compasse of them both in breadth and length, is eleuen foot one palme and a halfe. In the chappell of the said great Guy, distant from Warwick about one thousand paces, [or a mile] there hangeth a ribbe of this beast [as I suppose] the compasse whereof in the smallest place is three palmes, and in length it is sixe foote and a halfe, the ribbe is dry and rotten in the superficies thereof. The vulgar people affirme, that it is the peece of a Boare, which was slaine by Earle Guy, other say, by tradition of their elders, that it is a piece of a wilde Cow remaining neere Couentry, & did much harm to many people: which latter o∣pinion I embrace taking it for a Bonasus, who in most things is like a cow, and therefore some affirme it is an Indian Cow [but ignorantly] because any thing that is not common is vsually attributed to some strange countri-breed [with an addition to that it most of all resembleth.] The shape of these horns are heere following discribed. Thus farre D. C . Whereunto I assent holding his coniectures to be very probable, vntill by the diligent industry of some other, or my owne eie sight we may deliuer to the world som more assu∣red and perfect knowledge in these kinde of beastes. Exhorting in the meane season all learned men, to discouer more exactly their present or future knowledge heerein, to the high benefit of al them that are diligent students in this part of Gods creation. OF THE BVFFE. A Buffe is called in Greeke Tarandos, and in Latine Tarandus, Of the name and kind of Buffes. which some haue corrupted barbarously, terming it Paran∣drus and Pyradus, and I coniecture that it is the same beast, which the Polonians call Tur or Thuro ; howsoeuer other con∣found this Tarandus with another beast, called Rangifer ; and some with a kind of Vrus, which haue many properties in common with a Buffe, yet my reason, why the Polonian Tur can be no other then a Buffe, is because the head and mouth differeth from those beastes, and also by cause this is taken in Sarmatia, where the common people call it Daran or Da∣rau, although the later writers call it Duran and Daran, and translate it a Bonnasus, which can by no meanes agree with this beast; and the name of Daran is easily deriued from Ta∣randus or Tarandos. Also that the Polonion Tur should not be a Buffe, all that can be obiected, is, that the Hornes thereof are cragged or braunched, which thing Pliny attrybuteth to a Buffe▪ whereunto I answer, that the auncients did confound a Buffe with an Elke, and a Rangi∣fer ; for in the discription of an Elke they vary▪ diuers times mistaking one for another, by reason that they wrote altogither by report, none of them being seene in their contries, and therefore may easilie be deceiued in a Buffe, as well as in an Elke. The chiefe authors of this opinion haue beene Sir Thomas Eliot, and Georgius Agricola, with whom I will not contend▪ nor with any other man that can giue better reason: for Pliny maketh a Buffe to be a beast proportioned betwixt an Hart and an Oxe, of which sort is not a Rangifer, as shalbe manifested; and if it be▪ yet can it neuer appeare that a Rangifer doth change co∣lour like a Buffe, as also we will make more euident: So then, distinguishing a Buffe from a Rangifer, and presuming that the Polonian THVRO or Tur is a Buffe, we will proceed to his discription. Pliny The seueral parts. Siluius. Hesychius The head of this beast is like the head of a Hart, and his hornes branched or ragged; his body for the most part like a wilde Oxes, his haire deepe and harshe like a Beares, his hide is so hard and thicke▪ that of it the Scithians make breast-plates, which no dart can pierce through. His colour, for the most part like an Asses, but when he is hunted or fea∣red, he changeth his hew into whatsoeuer thing he seeth; as among trees he is like them: among greene boughs he seemeth greene; a myracle in his colour. amongst rocks of stone, he is transmuted in∣to their colour also; as it is generally by most writers affirmed: as Pliny & Solinus among the auncient; Stephanus and Eustathius, among the later Writers. This indeed is the thing that seemeth most incredible, but there are two reasons which draw me to subscribe hereunto: first, because we see that the face of men and beasts tho∣rough feare, ioy, anger, and other passions, doe quickly change; from ruddy to white, from blacke to pale and from pale to ruddy againe. Now as this beast hath the head of a Hart, so also hath it the feare of a Hart, but in a higher degree; and therefore by secret operation it may easily alter the colour of their haire, as a passion in a reasonable man, may alter the colour of his face. The same thinges are reported by Pliny of a beast in INDIA called Lycaon, as shall be afterward declared; and besides these two, there is no other among creatures couered with haire, that chaungeth colour. Another reason forcing me to yeeld herunto is, that in the sea, a Polypus -fish, and in the earth among creeping things, a Chamaeleon, doe also change their colour in like sort and fashion: whereunto it may be replyed, that the Cha∣maeleon and Polypus -fish, are pilled or bare without haire, and therefore may more easily be verse-coloured; but it is a thing impossible in nature, for the haire to receiue any tincture from the passions: but I answer, that the same nature can multiply and diminish her power in lesser and smaller Beastes, according to hir pleasure, and reserueth an ope∣ration for the nayles, and feathers of Birds, and finnes and scales of Fishes, making one sort of diuers colour from the other: and therefore may and doth as forcibly worke in the haires of a buffe, as in the skinne of a Chamaeleon ; adding so much more force to trans∣mute them, by how much farther off they stand from the blood, like as an Archer, which setteth his arme and bow higher to shoote farther, and therefore it is worthy obseruati∣on, that as this beast, hath the best defence by her skin aboue all other, so she hath the wa∣kest and most timerous heart aboue all other. These Buffes are bred in Scithia, and are therefore called Tarandi Scithic ; Countries of Buffes. they are al∣so among the Sarmatians, and called Budini, and neere Gelonis, and in a part of Poland, in the Duchy of Mazauia, betwixt Oszezke and Garuolyin. And if the polonian Thuro before mentioned, haue a mane [whereof I am ignorant] then will I also take that beast: for a kind of Bison. In phrygia, there is a territory called Tarandros, Stephanus and peraduenture this beast had his name from that Contrey, wherein it may be he was first discouered and made knowne. The quantity of this beast, exceedeth not the quantity of a wild Oxe, The quanti∣ty or stature of a Buffe. whereunto in al the parts of his body he is most like, except in his head face, and hornes: his Legges and hoofes are also like an Oxes. The goodnesse of his hide is memorable, and desired in all the cold countries of the world, wherein onely these beasts and all other of strong, thicke, The hide is most profita∣ble to man hides are found, for the thinnest and most vnprofitable skinnes of beastes, are in the whot and warmer partes of the world: and God hath prouided thicke, warme, most commo∣dious, and precious couers for those beasts that liue farthest from the Sunne. Where∣upon many take the hides of other beastes for Buffe, for being tawed and wrought artifi∣cially they make garmentes of them, as it is daily to be seene in Germany. Of the vulgar Bugill. A Bugill is called in Latine Bubalus, and Buffalus: The seuerall names in French Beufle : in Spaninsh, Bufano : in German, Buffell : and in the Illirian tongue, Bouwoll. The Haebrewes haue no proper word for it, but comprehend it vnder To, which signifieth any kind of wild Oxen; for neither can it be expressed by Meriah, which signifieth fatted oxen; or Bekarmi, which sig∣nifieth oxen properly; or Iachmur, which the Persians call Kutzcohi, or Buzcohi, and is vsually translated a wild-asse. For which beast, the Haebrewes haue many wordes: neither haue the Graecians any proper word for a vulgar Bugill, for Boubalos and Boubalis, are amongest them taken for a kind of Roe bucke. The origi∣nall of the term Buba∣lus So that this Bu∣balus was first of all some moderne or barbarous terme in Affrique, taken vp by the Itali∣ans, & by them attributed to this beast, and many other for whom they knew no proper names. For in the time of Pliny, they vse to call strange beastes like Oxen or Buls, Vri ; as now a daies (lead with the same errour, or rather ignorance] they call such Bubali or buf∣fali. The true effigies of the vulgar Bugill, was sent vnto me by Cornelius Sittardus, a famous Physitian in Norimberge ; and it is pictured by a tame and familiar Bugill, such as liueth among men for labour, as it seemeth to me. For there is difference among these beastes, [as Aristotle hath affirmed] both in colour, mouth, horne, and strength. This vulgar Bugill, Of the vul∣gar Bugill & hir parts is of a kinde of Wilde Oxen, greater and taller then the ordinary Oxen, their body being thicker and stronger, and their lims better compact together: their skinne most hard, their other partes very leane, their haire short, small, and blacke, but little or none at all vpon the taile, which is also short and small. The head hangeth downward to the earth, and is but little, being compared with the reasidue of his body; and his aspect or face betokeneth a tameable and simple disposition. His forehead is broad and curled with haire, his hornes more flat then round, very long, bending toge∣ther at the top, Pollonius. Vse of their hornes as a Goates doe backward: insomuch as in creete, they make bovves of them: and they are not for defence of the beast, but for distinction of kind and ornament. His necke is thicke and long, and his rump or neather part of his backe is lower then the residue, descending to the tayle. His Legs are very great, broad and strong, but shorter then the quantity of his body would seeme to permit. They are very fierce being tamed, but that is corrected by putting an Iron ring through his Nostriles, Erasmus. whereinto is also put a cord, by which he is lead and ruled, as a horse by a bridle (for which cause in Germany they call a simple man ouerruled by the aduise of another to his owne hurt, a Bugle, lead with a ring in his Nose.) His feete are clouen, and with the formost he will dig the earth, and with the hindmost fight like a horse, setting on his blowes with great force, and redoubling them againe if his obiect remoue not. His voice is like the voice of an oxe; when he is chased he runneth forth right, Albertus. The manner of his sight sildome winding or turning, and when he is angred he runneth into the Wa∣ter, wherein he couereth himselfe all ouer except his mouth, to coole the heate of his blood; Nature of their breed∣ing places Pet. crscent. for this beast can neither endure outward cold nor inward heate: for which cause, they breede not but in hot countries, and being at liberty are sildome from the waters. They are very tame, so that children may ride on their backes, but on a suddaine they will runne into the Waters, and so many times indaunger the childrens liues. Of their yōg ones & milk. Their loue to their young ones is very great, they alway giue milke from their copu∣lation to their caluing; neither will they suffer a calfe of another kinde (whom they dis∣cerne by their smell) to sucke their milke, but beate it away if it be put vnto them: where∣fore their keepers do in such case, annoynt the calfe with Bugils excrement, and then she will admit her suckling. Albertus. Their stren∣gth in labor They are very strong, and will draw more at once then two horsses; wherefore they are tamed for seruice, and will draw Waggons and plowes, and carry burdens also, but they are not very fit for carts: yet when they doe draw, they carry also great burthens or loads tyed to their backs with ropes and wantyghtes. Pet. crescent. At the first setting forward, they bend their Legges very much, but afterward they goe vpright, and being ouerloden they will fall to the earth, from which they cannot be raised by any stripes vntill their load or carriage be lessened. There is no great account made of their hides, although they bee very thicke: Vse of theyr hydes Bellonius. Solinus reporteth, that the old Britons made boates of osier twigs or reedes, couering them round with Bugils skinnes, and sayled in them: and the inhabitants of the kingdome of a Caraiani, make them bucklers and shields of Bugils skinnes, which they vse in Warres, the flesh is not good for meate, which caused baptista Fiera to make this poem: Bubalus hinc abeat, neue intret prandia nostra Non edat hunc quisquam: sub iugo semper eat. For they ingender melancholy and haue no good tast, being raw they are not vnplea∣sant to behold, but sod or rosted they shew a deformed substance. The milke of this beast maketh very hard cheese, which tasteth like earth. The medicines made of this beast are not many: with the hornes or hoofes they make rings to weare against the cramp, The physick made out of Bugils and it hath been beleeued [but without reason] that if a man or a woman weare rings made of the hornes and hoofes of a bugill in the time of car∣nall copulation, that they will naturally fly off from their fingers; whereas this secret was wont to be attributed to rings of Chrisolyts or Smaragde stones. To conclude, some teach husbandmen to burne the hornes or dung of their bugils on the windye side of their corne and plants, to keepe them from cankers and blasting: and thus much of the vulgar bugill, called bubalus recentiorum : whose beginning in this part of the world is vnknowne, al∣though in Italy and other parts of Europe they are now bred and fostered. OF THE AFFRICAN BVGILL. B Ellonius reporteth, that he saw in Cair a small beast which was in all things like a little Oxe, of a beautifull body, full of flesh, well and neately limmed, which he could take for no other then the Affrican Oxe, or Bugill of the old Graecians, which was brought out of the kingdome of Asamia vnto the citty Cair. It was old, and not so big as a Hart, but greater then a Roe ; The country of this beast. he neuer in all his life tooke more pleasure to behold a beast, then in viewing the excellent beauty of euery part in this creature. His haire was yellowish, glistering as if it had beene combed and trimmed by the art of a Barber: vnder his belly it was somewhat more red and taunty then vpon his backe. His feete in all thinges like a vulgar Bugils, his Legges short and strong, the necke short and thicke, whereon the dewe-laps of his crest did scarce appeare. His head like an Oxes, and his hornes growing out of the crowne of his head, blacke, long, and bending like a halfe Moone; whereof he hath no vse to defend himselfe, or annoy another, by reason their points turne inward. His eares like a cowes, and shoulder blades standing vp a little aboue the ridge very strongly. His taile, to the knees like a camelopardals, from whence hangeth some few blacke haires, twice so great as the haires in a horsses tayle. His voice was like an Oxes, but not so strong and loude: to conclude therefore, for his discription, if a man conceiue in his mind a little yellovv neate Oxe, with smooth haire, strong members, and high hornes aboue his head, like a halfe Moone, his minde cannot erre from the true and perfect shape of this beast. There was such a one to be seene of late at Florence, vnder the name of an Indian Oxe, sauing his head was greater and longer, his hornes not high nor bending together, but standing vp∣right and a little wreathing into spires aboue their roote, and the hinder part of the back much lower then the shoulders, but it may be the obseruer of this beast fayled and tooke not the true discription of it. This creature or Affrican Bugill, must be vnderstood to be a Wilde beast, The nature of this beast. and not of a tame kind, although Bellonius expresseth not so much. Leo in his discription of Affrique, relateth a discourse of a certaine beast called Laut or Daut, who is lesse then an Oxe, but of more elegant feature, in his Legs, white hornes, & blacke nailes, which is so swift, that no beast can outrunne it except a Barbary horse: it is taken most easily in the Summer time: with the skinne thereof they make targets and shieldes, which cannot be pierced by any Weapon, except Gunshot: for which cause they fell them very deare; which is con∣iectured to be the Bugill that Bellonius describeth, although it bee not iust of the same co∣lour, which may vary in this beast as well as in any other, and I haue a certaine Manu∣script without the authors name, that affirmeth there be bugils in Lybia, in likenes resem∣bling a Hart and an Oxe, but much lesser, and that these beasts are neuer taken asleepe, which causeth an opinion that they neuer sleepe; and that there is another Bugill beyond the Alpes, neere the Ryuer Rhene, which is very fierce and of a white Co∣lour. There is a horne in the towne-house of Argentine foure Romane cubits long, Of a strange horne in Ar∣gentine. which is coniectured to be the horne of some Vrus [or rather as I thinke of some Bugill ] it hath hung there at the least two or three generations, and by scraping it I found it to be a horne, although I forgat to measure the compasse thereof, yet bycause antiquity thought it wor∣thy to be reserued in so honorable a place for a monument of some strange beast, I haue also thought good to mention it in this discourse: as when Phillip King of Macedon, did with a Dart kill a Wilde Bull at the foote of the Mountaine Orbelus, and conse cated the hornes thereof in the Temple of Hercules, which were fifteene yards or paces long for posterity to behold. The Picture of the Affrican Bugill described in the former page. OF THE BVLL. A Bull is the husband of a Cow, and ring-leader of the heard, [for which cause Homer compareth Agamemnon the great Emperour of the Graecian Armye to a Bull] reserued onely for procreation, and is sometimes indifferently called an Oxe, as Oxen are likewise of authors taken for Buls Verg : Pingue solum primus extemplo mensibus anni, fortes inue tant houes. The Haebrewes call him Tor, or Taur ; which the Chaldes cal Abir for a strong Oxe: so the Arabians Ta ; the Grae∣cians Tauros ; the Latines Taurus, the Itallians Toro, the French Toreau, the Germans ein Stier, ein vuncherstier, das vucher, ein mummelstier, ein hagen, The true ae¦tymology o the name Taurus. and ein hollen ; the Illirians Vul and iunecz: by all which seuerall appellations it is e∣uident, that the name Taurus in Latine is not deriued from Tannouros, the stretching out the tayle, nor from Gauros, signifieng proud; but from the haebrew Tor, which signifieth great: vpon which occasion, the Graecians called all large, great, and violent thinges, by the name of Taurot, and that word Taurus among the Latines, hath giuen denomination to men, starres Mountaines, Ryuers, trees, ships, and many other things, which caused Ioachimus Camerarius to make thereof this aenigmaticall riddle. A Riddle vp on the word Taurus. Maechus eram regis: sed lignea membra sequebar, Et Cilicum mons sum: sed mons sum nomine solo Et vehor in coelo: sed in ipsis ambulo terris. That is in diuers senses, Taurus was a Kings Pander, the roote of a tree, a Mountaine in cili ia, a Bull, a Mountaine in name, a Starre or signe in heauen, and a Ryuer vpon the earth▪ so also we reade of Statilius Taurus, and Pomponius vitulus, two Romans. It was the custome in those daies, to giue the names of beastes to their children, especially among the Trogloditae, and that adulterer which rauished Europa, was Taurus the King of Creete ; or as some say, a King that came in a shipp, whose ensigne and n me was the Bull; and o∣ther affi me, that it was Iupiter in the likenesse of a Bull, bycause he had so defloured Ceres when he begat Proserpina, and afterward defloured Proserpina his daughter, in the likenesse of a Draggon. It is reported that when Achelous did fight with Hercules for Deianeira the Daughter of Oeneus king of Calydon, finding himselfe to be too weake to match Hercules, turned himselfe suddenly into a Serpent, and afterward into a bull; Hercules seeing him in that proportion, speedily pulled from him one of his hornes, and gaue it to Copia the companion of Fortune, whereof commeth that phrase of Cornucopia. Afterward, Ache∣lous gaue vnto Hercules one of the Hornes of Amalthea, and so receiued his owne againe, and being ouercome by Hercules, hid himselfe in the riuer of Thoas, which after his owne name bending forth into one horn or crook, was called Achelous. By these things the Po∣ets had singular intentions to decipher matters of great moment vnder hidden and dark Narrations. But there are foure reasons giuen, why riuers are called Taurocrani: that is, bul-heads. Reasons why riuers are cal¦led Taurocra∣ni. First, because when they empty themselues into the Sea, they roare or bellow like buls, with the noise of their falling water: secondly, because they furrow the erth like a draught of oxen with a plow, and much deeper. Thirdly, because the sweetest and deepest pasturs vnto which these cattell resort, are neare the riuers. Fourthly, because by their crooking and winding, they imitate the fashion of a horne, and also are impetuous, violent, and vnresistable. The strength of the head and necke of a bul is very great, The strength and seuerall parte of Buls. and his forehead seemeth to be made for fight: hauing hornes short, but strong and piked, vppon which he can tosse into the aire very great and weighty beasts which he receiueth againe as they fall downe, doubling their eleuation with renewed strength and rage, vntill they be vtterly confoun∣ded. Their strength in all the parts of their body is great, and they vse to strike backward with their heeles: yet is it reported by caelius Titormus a Neat-heard of Aetolia, The prodi∣gious strēgth of tritormos. that being in the field among the cattell, tooke one of the most fierce and strongest buls in the heard by the hinder leg, and there in despight of the bull striuing to the contrary, held him with one hand, vntill another bull came by him, whome he likewise tooke in his other hande, and so perforce held them both: which thing being seene by Milo Crotoniates, hee lifted vppe his handes to heauen, crying out by way of interogation to Iupiter ; and sayinge: O Iupiter, hast thou sent another Hercules amongest vs? Whereupon came the common prouerbe of a strong armed man: This is another Hercules. The like storie is reported by Suidas of Polydamas, who first of all slew a Lyon, and after held a bull by the legge so fast, that the beast striuing to get out of his handes, left the hoofe of his foote behinde him. The Epithites of this beast are many among writers, as when they call him br n-footed, wilde, chearefull, sharpe, plower, warriour, horne-bearer, blockish, great, gli∣stering, fierce, valiant, and louring, which seemeth to be natural to this beast; insomuch as the Grammarians deriue Toruitas, grimnes or lowring from Taurus a Bul, whose aspect carieth wrath and hatered in it: wherfore it is proverbially saide in Westphalia, of a low∣ring and scouling countenance, The seuerall parts. Eir sich als ein ochs der dem, fleschouwer Entloffen ist: That is, he looketh like a bul escaped from one stroke of the butcher. Their hornes are lesser but stronger then Oxen or kie, for all beasts that are not gelded, haue smaller hornes and thicker sculs then other, but the buls of Scithia as is said else-where, haue no horns. Their heart is full of nerues or sinnewes, their blood is ful of smal vaines, for which cause he in∣gendreth with most speed, and it hardneth quickly. In the gal of a Bul there is a stone cal∣led Guers, and in some places the gal is called Mammacur. They are plentiful in most coun∣tries as is said in the discourse of Oxen, Countries of their best breed. but the best sort are in Epirus, next in Thracia, & then Italy, Syria, England, Macedonia, Phrigia, and Belgia : for the buls of Gallia are impay∣red by labor, and the buls of Aethiope are the Rhinocerotes, as the buls of the woodes are Elephants. Their time of copulatiō. They desire the Cow at eight monthes olde, but they are not able to fill her til they be two years old, and they may remaine tolerable for breeders vntil they be 12. and not past. Euery bul is sufficient for ten kie, and the buls must not feed with the kie, for 2. months be¦fore their leaping time, and then let them come together without restraint, and giue them pease, Their food for procrea∣tion or barley, if theyr pasture be not good. The best time to suffer them with their fe∣males, is the midst of the spring, and if the bul be heauy, take the taile of a hart and burne it to pouder, then mo sten it in wine, and rubbe therewith the genitals of a bul, and he wil rise aboue measure into lust. Wherefore, if it bee more then tolerable, it must be alayed with oyle. The violence of a bul in the act of copulation is so great, that if he misse the fe∣males genital entraunce, Quintilius he woundeth or much harmeth her in any other place, sending forth his seed without any motion except touching, and a Cowe being filled by him, hee wil neuer after leape her, during the time she is with calfe: wherefore the Egiptians deci∣pher by a bul in health, without the itch of lust, a temperate continent man, and Epictetus saying of Sustine and Abstine: that is: Beare and Forbeare, was emblematicaly described by a bull hauing his knee bound and tyed to a cow in the hand of the neat hearde, vvith this subscription. Hard fortune is to be endured with patience, and happines is often to be feard, for Epictetus said beare and forbeare, we must suffer many things, and withhold our fingers from forbidden fruites, for so the bull which swayeth rule among beasts, being bound in his right knee, abstaineth from his female great with young. When they burne in lust, their wrath is most outragious against their companions in the same pasture, with whom they agreed in former times, and then the conquerour coup∣leth with the cow: The fight or combat of Lul es. but when he is weakened with generation, the beast that was ouercome, setteth vpon him a fresh, and oftentimes ouercommeth: which kind of loue-fight is ele∣gantly described by Oppianus as followeth. One that is the chiefest ruleth ouer all the o∣ther heard, who tremble at the sight and presence of this their eager King, and especi∣ally the Kye knowing the insulting iealousie of their raging husband. When the heards of other places meete together, beholding one another with disdaineful countenances, and with their loughing terrible voices prouoke each other, puffing out their flaming rage of defiāce, & dimming the glistering light with their oftē dust-beating-feet into the aire, who presently take vp the challenge & seperate themselues frō the company, ioyning togither at the sound of their owne trumpets-loughing-voice, in feareful and sharp conflicts, not sparing, not yelding, not retiring, til one or both of them fal wounded to the earth: some∣times turning round, sometimes holding heads together, as if they were coach-fellowes: and as two mighty ships wel manned, with sufficient armes and strength, by force of winds and floods violently rushing one against another, doe breake and split asunder, with the horrible cry of the Souldiers, and ratling of the armour: so doe these Buls, with voice, Legges, hornes, and strength, like cunning and valiant Martialists, make the soundes of their blows to ring betwixt heauen and earth, vntill one of them be vaquished and ouer∣throwne. The poore ouercommed beast, with shame retyreth from the heard, and will no more appeare vntill he be enabled to make his party good against his triumphant aduersarye: then he feedeth solitary in the woods and mountains, for it is prouerbially said to signifie a single and vnmarried life, abijt taurus in siluam : that is, the bull is gone to the wood to liue solitarily without his female, often exercising himself like a studious champion against the day of a new combate, and when he findeth his strength increased, and his corage ar∣med for the day of battaile, then roareth he in the woods and Mountains, to prouoke his aduersary to answere; and perceiuing his own voice to be more fierce and violent then is his enimies, forth he proceedeth like some refreshed giant, confident in his strength, dis∣cending to the lists of a second combate, where he easily ouer commeth the victor, weak∣ned with copulation, and not excercised or fitted to such a tryall through fulnes and ve∣nery: so the first that was vanquished becommeth conqueror. The very same is in other wordes described by Virgill : Buls are enemies to all Beastes that liue vpon pray, as Beares, Lyons, and Wolues: when they fight with wolus they wind their tailes together, & so driue them awaie with their horns; Georg. 3 Their enmi∣ty to other beasts. when the beare figh∣teth with an oxe; she falleth on her backe watching opportunitie to take his hornes with her forefeet, which if she catch, with the weight of her body she wearieth the beast, who is so earnest in combate with these beasts, that they will fight their tongues hanging out of their mouths. The Cro is enemy to buls and Asses, for in her flight she will strike at theyr eies, and it is easier for the Bul to be reuenged of a Lyon, then on such a bird: Red colour stirreth vp a Bul to fight, neither can the neat-heardes gouerne these with such facility as they do the femals, for when they wander and go astray, nothing can recall them but the voice of their females for copulation, which they vnderstande and heare, being a mile or two distant. The voice of a bull is sharper and shriller then is the loughing of a cow, they are most couragious that haue short and thicke necks, and in their greatest wildnes, if their right knee can be bound, they will not stirre, or if they be tyed to a wilde figge-tree, Horus Apollo A secret in the taming of a Bull. which is so fearfull to the nature of an oxe or bul, that it hath bene seen, how a very few sticks of that wood, haue sodde a great quantity of bulles fleshe in shorter time, then a farre greater number of other wood set on fire could perform: which caused the Egiptians in auncient time, to picture a Bull tyed to a wilde fig-tree, to signifie a man that changed his manners through calamity. Out of the hides of buls, especially their eares, neckes, and genitals, Their hide is most excellent glue confected, but for the most part it is corrupted; by seething with it olde leather of shooes or bootes: but that of Rhodes is without all fraud, fit for Phisitians and painters, & euermore the whiter the better, for that which is blacke is good for nothing: wherefore that which is made out of buls hydes, is so white, that it sendeth forth a brightnes, whose vertuous coniuction in conglutination is so powerfull, that it is easier to breake a whole peece of wood then any part so glewed togither therewith: and for this inuention, wee [are saith Pliny ] indebted to Dedalus the first author thereof. They vsed it in instruments of musicke, and such other tender and pretious actions. The gall of an oxe put vpon copper or brasse, maketh it glister like Golde; Of the Gal. for which cause it is vsed by players, to colour their counterfeit crownes. The flesh of a bull is good for meat, but yet not so good as an oxe or cow; Of the flesh. yet did the Egyptians abstain from eating cowes flesh, and not from the flesh of buls. These beasts are vsed in some places to plow, in some to fight, and it is reported by Eli∣anus, that Mythridates King of Pontus, beside his guard of men, had also a guard of a bull, a horse, and a Hart, which he tamed with his owne hands; so that when his followers were a sleep, if any stranger came near, they fayled not to awake him, by one of their seueral voi∣ces. It is reported also, that if the Nostrils of a bull be annointed with oyle of Roses, Leo Affric he wil presently loose his eye sight, and that in the Lake Asphaltites there can no liuing creature abide & yet many buls & camels svvim therin safely. It is but fabulous that ther wer Buls in Colchis which did breth out fire, except by that fiction the poets vnderstood, the beastly rage of the rich inhabitants. The sacrifi∣cing of Buls. Touching the sacrificing of buls, it vvas also the custome of the old Egyptians to sacrifice a Bull vnto Epaphus: and their manner was, first of all to try him whether it were fit for sacrifice, by laying meale before them, whereof if they re∣fused to tast, they were adiudged not apt for the Temple. The Druidae call a generall sacrifice Viscum, whereby they affirme all greeuances may be cured. Caelius. G raldus. Pliny First they prepared a banquet with sacrifice vnder some tree, then broght they two white buls fastened togither by the horns, and then they gaue a drinke to any barren creature, Woman or bruit beast, holding religiously, that by that drinke they shoulde be made fruitfull and free from al poison: Vnto so great a height did the folly of blinde people arise, to put religion in euery vnreasonable inuention, vnder pretence of any good intention deuised by idolatrous priests. As often as they slew and offered a Bul, and pou∣red Frankincense and wine vppon the hoast, they said; The bul is increased with Frankin∣cense and wine, but the Ionians did best comfort themselues in their sacrifices where the Bul before his death did lough at the Altar: Pausanias. and the Messenians did bind their bul which was to be sacrificed to the Ghosts of Aristomene, vnto certaine Pillars in his sepulchre: if therefore the Bul did shake the pillar while he leaped to and fro to get liberty, they took it for a good signe or Omen, but if it stood imouable, they held it a mournful and lamen∣table thing. It is likewise reported by Varinus that when Agamemnon ignorantly kild one of the harts of Diana in Aulis, she was so wroth, that she stayed the winds from blowing vpon his na∣uy, so as they could not stirre out of harbour: hereupon they went to the Oracle, where answere was giuen, that the goddesse was to bee pacified with some one of Agamemnons blood, therfore Vlisses vvas sent avvay to fetch Iphigenia, the dau. of Agam : from her mo∣ther clitemnaestra, vnder pretence to be maried to achilles ; but when she was ready to bee sacrificed, the goddesse took pittie on her, and accepted a bul in her steede, which ought not to bee thought incredible▪ seeing that in holy scripture a Ram was substituted in the place of Isaac. They were wont also to sacrifice a bul to Neptune, and to al the riuers, because of that affinity which they held a bul hath with al Waters: and to apollo, according to this vir∣gilian verse, Taurus Neptuno Taurum tibi pulcher apollo. But vnto Iupiter it was vnaccusto∣med to be offered, perhaps because he had often shevved himselfe in that likenesse, to ra∣uish and defloure Women. Prouerbs of a Buli. There be certaine prouerbes of a bul, which are not altogi∣ther impertinent in this place. First, it is commonly saide, that hee may beare a bul that hath born a calfe▪ wherby is meant, that he may be more subiect to filthines in age, which was so in youth. Quartilla was a woman of most vilde reputation for vncleannes, because she said, that when she was little, she lay with little ones like her selfe, and when she grevv bigger, Like the En∣gl r uerb sky fall we shal haue . she applied her selfe to the pleasure of elder men, grovving in filthines as she had increased in yeares. Likevvise they vvere vvont to say of an absurde or impossible thinge, that if a bul could reach his head ouer taygetus, hee might drinke of the riuer Eurota, and the beginning of this prouerbe, was taken of an apothegme of Geradas, when his hoast vp∣on a time did ask him vvhat punishment the Lacedemonians had appointed for adulterers, he aunsvvered there vvere no adulterers in Lacedemon, and therefore the punishment & question vvere fri olous? his hoast replyed; but if there shoulde bee an adulterer there, vvhat punishment vvould they appoint for him? Marry [said Geradus ) he shold pay such a bul as would reach ouer taygetus to drinke of the Water Eurota ; whereat the host laugh∣ed demaunding where such a bul could be found? then said Geradas, and vvhere can you find an adulterer in Lacede non, so putting off one absurdity vvith another. And thus much of the natures and properties of a bul in general. In the nexte place before this beast be turned into the Woods, vve vvil describe his medicinal vertues, and so let him loose. The pouder of a buls horn drunk in vvater stayeth a flux of blood and the loosnes of the bell Sextus and Eseulapius say, The medi∣cins o Buls that if a buls horne be burned in a place where serpents abide i driueth the navvay The blood of buls mingled vvith barley flovver, driueth a∣vvay hardnes in the flesh, & being dryed cureth apostems in euery part of the body. It ta∣keth away spots in the face, & kileth serpēts: It is cōmended warm against the gou , espe∣cially in horses. It is not good for to drinke, beause it is easily congealed, except the lit∣tle vaynes bee taken out. It is accounted among the chiefest poysons, and therefore it is thought by Plutarch, that Anniball poysoned himselfe by drinking Buls blood, being thereunto perswaded by his Seruant, for so dyed Themistocles : and Psammenitus King of Egypt, taken by Cambises, was constrained to drinke the blood of a Bull; where∣vpon immediately he gaue vp the ghost. For remedy heereof, it is good to beware of vomitting, bycause the blood congealed in the stomach into lumps, stoppeth the throate; wherefore all those things which dissolue Milke in the stomach, are also medicinable a∣gainst the blood of Buls. In these cases let the party be first of all purged by glister or o∣therwise, and then annoynt the stomache and belly with barly meale and sweete Water, laying it vnto them like a plaister: likewise Lupines, Oxymell, and nitre, are Soueraigne in this, as all Physitions know. The dry leaues of Neppe or Calamach is profitable against this Malady ; so also are ashes made of the lees of wine burned. The fat of a Bull is profitable to many thinges. First therefore, it must be plucked out warme from the raynes of a Bull and washed in a Ryuer or brooke of running Water, Dioscorides. pulling out the skinnes and tunicles, then melt it in a newe earthen pot, hauing cast a∣mong it a little salt, then set in faire cold Water, and when it beginneth to congeale, rubbe it vp and downe in the hands, wringing out the water, and letting it soke in againe, vntill it appeare well washed; then boyle it in a pot with a little sweet wine and being sod∣den let it stand all night: if in the morning it sauour strong, then poure in more Wyne, seeth it againe, vntill that sauour cease, and so all the poyson be remoued: and beware of salt in it, especially if it be to bee vsed in diseases, whereunto salt is an enemy, but being thus vsed it looketh very white, after the same manner may be vsed the fat of Lyons, Le∣opards, Panthers, camels, Boares, and Horsses. The fat kall about the gutts melted in a frying pan, and annoynted vpon the geni∣tals and brest, helpeth the Dysenterie. The marrow of a Bull beaten and drunke, cureth the payne in the small of the belly: and Rasis sayth, that if it be melted at a fire, and min∣gled with one fourth parte of Myrrhe and oyle of bayes, and the handes and feete bee therewithall annoynted and rubbed, morning and euening; it helpeth the contractions of the Nerues and sinnewes. The fat of a dormouse, of a hen, and the marrow of a Bull, melted togither, and pou∣red warme into the eares, easeth their paine very much: and if the liuer of a Bull be broi∣led on a soft fire, and put into ones mouth that hath the tooth-ache, the paine wil goe a∣way so soone as euer the teeth touch it. The gall of a bull is sharper then an Oxes, and it is mingled with honey for a wound-plaster, and in all outward remedies against poison. It hath also a quality to gnaw the deadnes or corruption out of wounds, and with the iuyce of leekes and the milke of Women, it is applyed against the Swine pox and fistulaes; but the gal alone rubbed vpon the biting of an Ape, cureth that Malady. Likewise, the vlcers in the head, both of men, women, and children. And if the woole of a hare be burned to ashes, and mingled with oyle of myrtles. Buls gall, and beaten alume, and so warmed and annointed vppon the heade, it stayeth the falling away of the haire of the head. With the gall of a Bull, and the white of an Egge, they make an eye-salue, and so an∣noint therewith dissolued in water foure dayes togither; but it is thought to bee better with hony and balsam: and instilled with sweet new wine into the eares, it helpeth awaye the paines of them, especially running-mattry eares, with womans or Goats milke. It be∣ing taken with hony into the mouth, helpeth the cliftes and sores therein; and taken with the water of new coloquintida and giuen to a woman in trauel, causeth an easie child birth. Galen was wont to giue of a buls gall the quantity of an almonde, with two spoonefuls of wine, called [ Vinuus Lynghatum ] to a Woman that hath her childe dead within her body, which would presently cause the dead Embrion to come forth. The genital of a red bull, dryed to pouder and drunke of a Woman, to the quantity of a golden Noble, it maketh her to loath al maner of copulation but in men (as the later Phisitians affirme) it cau∣seth that desire of lust to increase. The dung of a bul layed too warm, helpeth al hardnesse; and burnt to pouder, helpeth the member that is burnt. The vrine or stale of buls with a little Nitre taketh away scabs and Leprosies. Of another Beast called Buselaphus. T Here was (saith D. cay ) a clouen footed beast brought out of the deserts of Mauritania into England, of the bignesse of a hinde, in forme and countenance betwixt a hinde and a cow, The descrip¦tion of this strange beast and therefore for the resemblance it beareth of both, I will call it Buselaphus, or Boniceruus, or Moschelaphus, or a cow hart; hauing a long and thinne head and eare, a leane and slender Leg and Shinne, so that it may seeme to bee made for chase and celerity. His taile not much longer then a foote, The name. but the forme thereof very like a cowes, and the length like a harts, as if nature seemed to doubt whether it should encline to a cow or a hart: his vpper parts were yellowish and smooth, his neather partes blacke and rough; the haire of his bodye betwixt yellow and red, falling close to the skinne, The seuerall parts. but in his forehead standing vppe like a Starre; and so also about the hornes which were blacke and at the top smooth, but downward rough with Wrinkles meeting on the contrary part, and on the neerer side spreading from one another, twice or thrice their quantity. These hornes are in length one foote & a hand bredth, but three hand bredthes thicke at the roote, and their distance at the roote was not aboue one fin∣gers bredth, so arising to their middle, and a little beyond where they differ or grow a∣sunder three hands bredth and a halfe; then yeeld they together againe a little, and so with another crooke depart asunder the second time, yet so, as the tops of the hornes do not stand asunder aboue two hands bredth, three fingers and a halfe. From the crowne of the head to the Nostrils, there goeth a blacke strake which is one foote, two palmes and one finger long, in bredth aboue the eyes where it is broadest, it is seuen fingers, in thicknesse one foote and three palmes, it hath eight teeth, and wanteth the vppermost like a cow, Pausamas. and yet cheweth the cud, it hath two vdders vnder the belly like a heyghfer that neuer had calfe, it is a gentle and pleasant beast, apt to play and sport, being not one∣ly swift to runne, but light and actiue to leape: It will eate any thing, either bread, broath, salted or pouldred beefe, grasse or herbes, and the vse heereof being aliue is for hunting, and being dead the flesh is sweete and pleasant for meate. OF THE OXE and COVV. W E are now to describe those beasts which are lesse forraign and strange, and more commonly knowne to all nations, then any other foure-foo∣ted Beast: for howsouer Bugils, Buffes, Lyons, Beares, Tigers, Beuers, Por∣cupines and such other, are not alway found in euery nation, yet for the most part are Oxen, Kine, Buls, and Horsses, by the prouidence of Al∣mighty God, disseminated in all the habitable places of the world: and to speake the truth, Oxen and Horsses were the first riches, and such things wherein our elders gatte the first property, long before houses and landes: with them they rewarded men of highest desert, as Melampus who opened an oracle to Nelens that sought out the lost Oxen of Iphiclus. And Erix king of Sicily, so much loued the Oxen that Hercules reco∣uered from Geryon, that when he was to contend with Hercules about these, he rather yel∣ded to depart from his kingdome then from his cattell: and Iulius Pollux affirmeth, that there was an auncient coine of money, which was stamped with the figure of an Oxe, and therefore the cryer in euery publicke spectacle made proclamation, that he which deser∣ued well, shold be rewarded with an ox, [meaning a peece of mony hauing that impresse vpon it: which was a piece of Golde compared in value to an English Rose-noble,] and in my opinion the first name of money among the Latines is deriued from Cattell for I cannot inuent any more probable aetymologie of Pecunia, Pl y. then from Pecus, signifying al manner of catell: howsoeuer it is related by some Writers, that on the one side of their coine was the kings face, and on the other an oxes picture; and that Seruius was the firste that euer figured mony with Sheep or oxen. Miron the great painter of Eleutheris, and dis∣ciple of Agelas, made an heighfer or Cow of brasse, which all Poets of Greece haue cele∣brated in sundry Epigrams, because a calfe came vnto it to suck it, being deceiued with the proportion, and Ausonius also added this following vnto the saide calfe and cow, saying: Vbera quid pulsas frigentia matris Ahenae: O vitula? & succum lactis ab aere petis? Whereunto the brazen cow is caused to make this answere following; hunc quoque praestarem, si me pro parte parasset: Exteriore Miron, interiore Deus. Whereby he derideth their vaine labours, which endeauor to satisfie themselues vppon mennes deuises, Valia. which are cold and comfortlesse without the blessing of almighty God. To begin therefore with these beastes it must be first of all remembred, that the name bos or an oxe as we say in English, Of the name Bos. is the most vulgar and ordinarie name for Bugles, bulles, cowes, Buffes, and all great clouen-footed-horned-beasts; although in proper speech, it signifieth a beast gelded or libbed of his stones: and Boas signifieth a huge great Serpent whereof there was one found in Italy, that had swallowed a child whole without breaking one of his bones, obseruing also in oxen the destinction of yeares or age: which giueth them seuerall names, for in their young age they are called calues, in their second age Steeres, in their third Oxen, and the Latines adde also a fourth which they call V tuli old oxen. These are also distinguished in sexe, the Male calfe is Vitulus, the Female Vitula, likewise Inueucas a Steere, and Inueuca an heighfer, Bos an oxe, and Vacca a cow, Taurus a Bull Taura a barren cow, and Horda a bearing or fruitefull cow: of whom the Romanes ob∣serued certaine festiuall daies called Hordicalia, wherein they sacrificed those cattell. The Latines haue also Vaccula and Bucula for a little cow, Vaccula nonnunquam secreta cubilia captans Virg: And againe Aut bucula coelum. And Bucalus or Bos Nouellus for a little oxe. Schor in Haebrew signifieth a Bull or oxe, Bakar heards, or a cow. Thor in the Chalday hath the same signification with Schor, and a∣mong the latter Writers you may find Tora a masculine, and Torata a feminine, for a Bull and a cow, accustomed to be handled for labour. The Graecians call then bous & boes, the Arabians bakar: and it is to be noted that the holy scriptures distinguish betwixt tzon, sig∣nifieng flockes of sheepe and Goates, & bakar for heards of cattel and Neate : and Me a is taken for Bugils, or the greatest oxen, or rather for fatted oxen, for the verbe Mara ▪ sig∣nifieth to feed fat. Egela is interpreted Ierem : 46. for a young cow; and the Persians Gosa∣lai : It is very probable that the Latin Vacca is deriued from the haebrew bakar, as the Sa∣racen word baccara ; so in Haebrew Para is a cow, and Par a Steere, and ben bakar the sonne of an oxe, or calfe: and wheras the Haebrews take Parim, for oxen in general, the chaldees translate it Tore, the Arabs Bakera, the Persians Nadgaeah, or Madagaucha, the Itallians call it bue, the French beuf, the Spaniard buey, the Germanes Ochs and Rind, the Illirians wull. Of the name of a Cow. The Italians call a cow Vacca at this day, the Gaecians bubalis, and Damalis or Da∣malai [for a cow which neuer was couered with Bul, or tamed with a yoake] and Agelada. The French Vache, the Spaniardes Vaca, the Germanes; Ku, or Kuhe ; and the cittizens of Altina, ceua : from which the English word cow seemeth to be deriued, the Latine word is a young heighfer, which hath ceased to be a calfe. There are oxen in most part of the world, which differ in quantity, nature, and man∣ner, The diuersi∣ty of Oxen in al cūtries. one from another, and therefore doe require a seuerall tractat. And first, their oxen of Italy are most famous, for as much as some learned men haue a firmed, that the name Italia, Ʋarro. was first of all deriued of the Greeke word Italous, signifieng oxen; because of the aboundance bred and nourished in those parts, and the great account which the auncient Romanes made heereof, Oxē of Italy appeareth by notable example of punishment, who banished a certaine countrey man for killing an oxe in his rage, and denying that he eate thereof, as if he had killed a man: likewise in Italy theyr oxen are not all alike, for they of campania are for the most part white and slender, yet able to manure the countrey wherein they are bred; they of Vmbria, are of great bodies, yet white & red coloured. In hetruria and Lati∣nui, they are very compact and wel set or made, strong for labour, but the most stronge are those of Apennine, although they appeare not to the eie very beautifull. The Egyptians which dwell about Nilus haue oxen as vvhite as snovv, and of exceeding high and great stature, (greater then the Oxen of Graecia ) yet so meeke and gentle, Aristotle Oppianus. Aonia. Aelianus Leo Affric: that they are easily ruled and gouerned by men. The Aonian Oxen are of diuers colours, intermingled one within another, hauing a whole round hoofe like a horse, and but one horne growing out of the middle of their forehead. The domesticall or tame Oxen of Affrique are so small, that one would take them for calues of two yeares olde, Affricā oxen the Affricans (saith Strabo ) which dwell betwixt Getulia and our coast or countrey, haue Oxen and horses which haue longer lips and hoofes then other, and by the Graecians are tearmed Mecrokeilateroi. The Armenian Oxen haue two hornes, Armenian Oxen. Aeliantus. but vvinding and crooking to and fro like Iuye which cleaueth to okes, which are of such exceeding hardnesse that they wil blunt a∣ny sworde that is stroke vppon them, without receiuing any impression or cut thereby. Some are of opinion, that the onely excellent breede of cattell is in Boeotia, neere the cit∣ty Tanagra [called once Poemandra ] by reason of their famous cattel, Varinus. Baeotiā oxen the which Oxen are called coprophaga, by reason that they will eate the dung of man; so also doe the Oxen of ciprus to ease the paines of their smal guts. The caricians in a part of Asia are not pleasant to behold, hauing shaggye haire, and bounches on either shoulders, Cariciā oxē. reaching or swel∣ling to their Neckes; but those vvhich are either white, or blacke, are refused for labour. Epirus yeeldeth also very great and large oxen, vvhich the inhabitants cal Pyrhicae, Epirus. be∣cause that their first stocke or seminary were kept by King Pirrhus : hovvsoeuer, other say that they haue their name of their fiery flaming colour; they are called also Larini of a village Larinum, or of Larinus, a chiefe Neat-heard: of whom Ahaeneus maketh mention, who receiued this greate breede of cartel of Hercules when he returned from the slaughter of Gerion : vvho raigned about Ambracia and Ampholochi, vvhere through the fatnesse of the earth and goodnesse of the pasture they grovv to so great a stature: other call them cestrini, I know not for vvhat cause, yet it may be probable that they are called Larini, Pliny Aristotle Theodore . by reason of their broad Nostriles, for Rines in Greeke signifieth Nostrils: but the true cause of their great bone and stature is, bycause that neither sexe were suffered to couple one vvith another, vntil they vvere foure yeares old at the least, and therefore they vvere cal∣led Atauri, and Setaeuri, and they vvere the proper goods of the King: neither could they liue in any other place but in Epirus, by reason that the whole country is ful of sweete and deepe pastures. Al the oxen in Eubaea are white at the time of their caluing, Eubaea Aelianus. and for this cause the poets cal that countrey Argiboeon. If that oxen or swine be transported or brought into Hispani∣ola, Hispaniola Oxen. Pet▪ Martyr they grow so great, that the oxen haue beene taken for Elephantes, and their swine for Mules, but I take this relation to be hyperbolical. There are Oxen in India which wil eate flesh like Wolues, and haue but one horne and whole hoofes: some also haue three hornes, there be other as high as Cammels, Rasis. Indian oxen C. Tesias Solinus. Pliny. Aelianus. and their hornes foure foote broad. There was a horne brought out of India to Ptolmy the se∣cond, which receiued three Amphoraes of water, amounting the least too thirty english gallons of Wine measure; whereby it may bee coniectured of how great quantity is the beast that bare it. The Indians, both Kings and people make no small reckoning of these beastes, [I meane their vulgar Oxen] for they are most swift in course, and wil runne a race as fast as any horse, so that in their course you cannot know an Oxe from a horse; waging both Gold and Siluer vpon their heads; and the Kings themselues are so much delighted with this pastime, that they follow in their Wagons, and will with their owne mouthes and handes prouoke the beastes to runne more speedily: and heerein the Oxe exceedeth a horse, bycause he wil not accomplish his race with sufficient celerity, except his rider draw blood from his sides with the spur, but the oxes rider neede not to lay any hands or pricks at al vpon him, his onely ambitious nature of ouercomming [carrying him more swiftly then all the rods or spurs of the world could preuaile on him]: And of this game, the lowest of the people are also very greedy, laying many Wagers, making many matches, and aduenturing much time and price to see their euent. Among the Indians there are also other oxen which are not much greater then great Goates, who likewise in their yoaks are accustomed to runne many races, which they per∣forme with as great speede as a Getican horse: A anus. and all these running Oxen must be vnder∣stood to be wild Oxen. Leuctriā oxē Garamantae. There bee Oxen in Leuctria [which Aristotle affirmeth] haue their eates and hornes growing both together forth of one stemme. The Oxen of the Garamants, and all other Neate among them, feede with their necks doubled backward, for by reason of their long and hanging hornes, they cannot eate their meate, holding their heads directly straight: The selfe same is reported of the beastes of Trogloditae : Solinus. Herodotus. in other things, they differ not from other oxen, saue onely in the hardnesse of their skinne, and these oxen are called Opisthonomi. Bangala. Aristotle In the prouince of Bangala, are oxen [saith Paulus Venetus ] which equall the Elephant in hight. The oxen in Mysia haue no hornes, which other affirme also of the Scithians, whereof they assigne this reason, because the vniuersall bone of the skull hath no Comis∣sure or ioynt opened, and cannot receiue any humour flowing vnto it, by reason of the hardnesse resisting, and the vaines belonging to this bone are weaker and smaller then in other; for which also they are more vnfit to conuay nourishment to the place: and so the neck of these beastes, must needes be more dry and lesse stronge, bycause the vaines are very little. The oxen haue bunches growing on their backes like Cammels, and vpon them doe they beare their burdens, being taught by the discipline of men, to bend on their knee to receiue their load. Aelianus. Nomadian Oxen. Among the Nomades [which winter their cattell about the Marishes of Maeotia ] there are also certaine cattell without hornes; whereof some are so naturally, the other haue their hornes sawed off, as soone as they grow forth, because of all the parts of their body, they onely can endure no cold. Aelianus. Oppianus. Phrygian & Erythrean Oxen. There be oxen in Phrigia and Erithrea which are of a flaming red colour, of a very high and winding neck, their hornes are not like any other in the world, for they are mooued with their eares turning in a flexible manner sometyme one way and sometime ano∣ther. Aelianus Oxē of Syria The Syrian Oxen called Poellei are of great strength, hauing a broade forehead, strong hornes, and fearefull or courragious aspect, being neither too fat or too leane of their bodyes; and they are vsed both for War and also for running. The oxen of the Belgian prouinces, especially in Fresland and Holland, are also of very great stature, for it hath beene found by good experience, that one of them hath waighed sixteene hundred pounds Troy waight: Belgian oxen Guicciardine and when the Earle of Hoochstate was at Machlin in Fresland, there was presented vnto him a great oxe which being killed, waighed aboue two thousand fiue hundred twenty and eight pound. The which thing being so strang as the like had not beene beforetime obserued; to the entent that succeeding ages might not mistrust such a memorable report, the said Earle caused the full Picture of the said oxe, to be set vp in his Pallace with an inscription of the day and year when this oxe was deliuered and killed. OF COVVES. H Auing thus noted briefely the countries wherein oxen are bred and nou∣rished with their seuerall formes: it must be also obserued, that Kyne or cowes which are the Female of this kind, are likewise found in all the places aforsaid with correspondent and semblable quantities, qualities, members, parts, and other accidents to such creatures appertayning; excepted al∣waies those things which belong to their sexe, which principally concerne their milk. And first of al the Kyne of most plentiful Milke in all Italy, Milk of kine in Italy are about Altinas a citty of the Vene∣tians, neere Aquileia, which Kyne are of the smalest body, and yet the greatest labourers, who are not yoaked or coupled together by their Necks as in other countryes, but onely by their heads. The Cowes of Arabia haue the most beautifull hornes by reason of aboundance of hu∣mours which flow to them, Arabian Cowes. feeding them continually with such generous liquor as natu∣rally doeth encrease them. The Pyrrheaen Kye are not admitted to the Bull till they be foure yeare old at the least, Pyrrhecan Cowes. which thing causeth them to grow to a very high and tall stature: whereof there were e∣uer foure hundred kept for the Kings store. These Kye doe giue at one time seauen or eight gallons of Milke, of Wine measure, and they are so tall, that the person which milketh them must stand vpright, or else stoope ve∣ry little: Phaenitian Cowes. Aelianus neither ought this seeme incredible, for it is euident that the cowes of the Phani∣tians were so high, that a very tall man could not▪ Milke them execept he stood vpon a footestoole. The manner is in Germany and Heluetia, that about Aprill some take Kye to hire, which haue none of their owne, Hiring of Cowes in Germany & Heluetia. and other buy Kye to farme them out to other: and the com∣mon price of a cow for sixe monthes is payed in butter, and is rated of seuenty fiue pounds, twelue ounces to the pound; which payment is due to the owner, or money to that value: Other againe, buy Kye and let them forth to farme, reseruing the calfe to themselues, and if by the negligence of the cow-heard or farmer of them, the cow cast the calfe, then is the hirer bound to answer the value, but if it miscarry without his negli∣gence (as oftentimes they may) then is the losse equall to the Locatour or Farmer. Yet it is noted, that the Kye of greatest bodyes, are not alway best or most plentifull in Milke; for the Cowes or C uae of Altinas in Italy, are of little bodies, but yet very full of Milke. The vse of Cow-milke. The principall benefit of cowes Milke is for making of Butter, for the Milke it selfe, the Cheese and Whay, are not so fit for nourishement of man, as are those of sheepe; and the reason is, because the Milke of Kye is fattest of all other; and therefore the name of Butter, Pet▪ Crescent Aristotle Marc: Virg: Food for Cows giuing milke. which is in Greeke Boutyros and Boutyron, and Butyrum in Latine, is deriued properly from this kind of cattell. The cow-heards doe also for their profit, obserue the pasture and foode, which doeth aboue other multiply Milke: and therefore they giue their Kye Trifolie▪ or three leaued-grasse: and Medica which [is a kind of clauer-grasse] Vetches, pulse and Beanes, for Beanes haue a great vertue to multiply Milke: likewise I haue seene bundels of Hemlocke, or an herbe much like vnto it, [which we call harts-tongue] giuen to milch Kye. There is an hearb much like crow-foote, called of the Germanes Butterbloumen, and in English Butter-flower, which is vsed to colour Butter, for thereby is the whitenesse ther∣of taken away: they will not eate wal-wort or night-shad [commonly called deaths herb] but if they eate hearbes whereupon falleth an Hony-dew, then will their Milke bee won∣derfull sweete and plentiful; there is no foode so good for cowes, as that which is greene, if the countrey will afforde it; especially, Kye loue the wet and watery places, although the butter comming from the Milke of such beastes, is not so wholsome, as that which is made of such as are fed in dryer pastures. The like care is had of their drinke, for al∣though they loue the coldest and clearest waters, yet about their time of caluing, it is much beter for them to haue warmer waters, Palladius. & therfore the lakes which are heated and made to some by the raine, are most wholsome to them, and do greatly help to ease their burthen and paines in that businesse. Pausanias reporteth a wonder in nature, of the Ryuers Milichus and Charadrus, running through the citty Patrae, that all the Kye which drinke of them in the spring time, doe for the most part bring forth Males, wherfor their herdmen auoyd those places at that time. Ky for the most part before their caluing, are dry and without Milk [especialy about Toro∣na. ] They are also purged of their mensterua in greater measure, then either Goates or sheepe, which especially come from them a little before or after they haue beene with the Bull; howsoeuer Aristotle saith, that they come from them after they haue beene fiue monthes with calfe, and are discerned by their vrine; for the vrine of a cow is the thinnest of all other. Aelianus These beasts are very lustfull, and doe most eagarly desire the company of their male, which if they haue not within the space of three houres after they mourne for it, their lust aswageth till another time. In a village of Egypt called Schussa (vnder the gouern∣ment of the Hermopolites ) they worship Venus vnder the title Vrania in the shape of a cow, parswading themselues, that there is great affinity betwixt that Goddesse and this beast; for by hir mournefull voyce she giueth notice of her loue, who receiueth the token ma∣ny times a Mile or two off, and so presently runneth to accomplish the lust of nature: and for this cause doe the Egyptians Picture Isis, with a Cowes hornes, and likewise a Bull, to signifie hearing. The signes of their bulling [as it is tearmed] are their cries, Signes of a cowes desire to the Bul. and disor∣derly forsaking their fellowes, and resisting the gouernment of their keeper. Likewise, their secret hangeth forth more then at other times, and they wil leap vpon their fellows as if they were males: besides after the manner of mares, they oftner make water then at other times. The most cunning heardmen haue meanes to prouoke them to desire the bul, Secrets to prouoke lust in cattel if they be slack, first of all they withdraw from them som part of their meat, (if they be fat,) for that wil make them fitter to conceiue: then take they the genitals or stones of a bul, and hold it to their nose, by smelling whereof they are prouoked to desire copulation; and if that preuaile not, then take the tendrest part of Shrimps, which is their fish, and beat them in water til they be an ointment, and therewith annoint the breastes of the Cow, Collumella after they haue bene wel washed vntil it worke vpon her: And some affirme, that the taile of an Eele put into her hath the same vertue; other, attribute much force to the wild willow, to pro∣cure lust and conception. They are a great while in copulation, Signes at the copulation to know whi¦ther the calfe wil be Male or Female. and some haue gessed by certaine signes at the time of copulation, whether the calfe proue male or female; for say they, if the bul leap downe on the right side of the cow, it wil be a male, if on the left, it wil be a female, which coniecture, is no longer true, then when the cow admitteth but one bul, and conceiueth at the first coniunction, for which cause the Egyptians decipher a woman bringing forth a maiden child, by a bul looking to the left hand, and likewise bearing a man child, by a bul looking to the right hand. They are not to be admitted to copulation before they be two yeare olde at the least, or if it may be foure; yet it hath bene seene, that a heighfer of a yeare old hath conceiued, and that another of foure moneths old hath likewise desired the Bul; but this was taken for a monster, and the other neuer thriued. One bull is sufficient for fifteenekie, although Varro saith, that he had two buls for threescore and tenkie; and one of them was two yeare olde, the other one. The best time for their copulation is about the time of the Dolphins appearaunce, and so continueth for two or three and fourtye daies which is about Iune and Iulye, for those which con∣ceiue at that time, will bring forth their young ones in a most temperate time of the year: and it hath bene obserued, that an oxe immediately after his gelding, before he had for∣gotten his former desire and inclination, his seed not dried vp, hath filled a cow, and she proued with calfe. They go with calfe ten monethes, except eighteene or twenty dayes; Aristotle but those which are calued before that time, cannot liue: and a cowe may beare euery yeare [if the coun∣try wherein she liueth bee full of grasse, and the calfe taken awaye from her at fifteene dayes olde.] And if a man desire that the calfe should be a male, Meanes to cause the calf at the time of copulatiō to be eyther male or fem. then let him tie the right stone of the Bull at the time of copulation; and for a female binde the left: Others worke this by naturall obseruation; for when they would haue a male, they let their cattel couple when the North wind bloweth, and when a female, they put them togither when the ayre is southerly. They liue not aboue fifteene yeares, and thereof ten times they may engen∣der. The best time to calue in is Aprill, because then the spring bringeth on grasse, The length of theyr age. both for themselues, and to increase milke for the young ones. They beare not but in their right side, although they haue twins in their belly, which happeneth very sildome, and the beast immediately after hir deliuery, must be norished with some good meat, for except she be well fed, shee will forsake her young to prouide for her selfe: therefore it is requisit to giue her vetches, Millet-seede, and milke mingled with water, and scorched corne; and vnto the calues themselues, dried Millet in milk, A secret in copulation. in the maner of a mash: and the kie must also be kept vp in stables, so as they may not touch their meat at the going foorth, for they are quickly brought to forsake and loath that which is continuall before them: and it is obserued that when kie in the Summer time do in greater number aboue custome goe to the bull then at other times, it betokeneth and foresheweth a wet and rainy winter, for it cannot be (saith Albertus ) that a beast so dry as is a cowe, can bee increased in moisture, which stirreth vppe the desire of procreation, except also ther be a mutation in the aire vnto abundance of moysture. And to conclude this discourse of a cow, in auntient time they were wont to cal light womē heighfers, har∣lots, and kine, by the reason of two famous harlottes of Athens, Cuina and Salamachha, & from this came the fiction of Io, whose fable is at large prosecuted by Ouid, how she being the daughter of Inachus, was in a darkenes brought vpon hir by Iupiter, by him rauished, which mist being espyed by Iuno, she discended to the earth, and Iupiter fearing his wiues iealousy turned the said Io into a heighfer, from which shape she was afterward deliue∣red & married to Osiris the king of Egipt, and after her death was worshipped by the Egyp¦tians for a god, and called Isis, vnto whō they sacrificed Geese which wer called Sacra Isi∣aca. In the choise of kie, you must obserue this direction, you must buy them in the month of March, the chois . let them be young, not past their first or second calfe, their colour black or red, sildom brown, or white, bright coloured, specialy red, brown legs, blackish horns smooth and beautifull, high foreheades, great eies and blacke, hairy and grisle eares, flat Nostrils like an Apes, but open and wide, their backebone bending somewhat backewarde, blacke lips, long and thicke neckes, most broad faire crests discending from the necke, wel rib∣bed, a great belly, the backe and shoulders verie broad, the Buttockes broad; with a long taile hanging downe to their heels, and theyr neather part in many places crisped or cur∣led, wel set and compacted legs rough and short: straight knees, and their bunches han∣ging ouer: their small feet, not broad but round, standing in good distance one from o∣ther, not growing crooked or splay-footed, and their hoofes smooth and like one ano∣ther euery way. Finally, ere a profitable thing to prosecute natures perfection in euery one of their seuerall parts, but I spare to speake any more of the females, and returning a∣gain to the story of oxen from which we haue digressed, leauing the readers who desire to hear more of this discourse of kie to other authors, whoe purposely describe euery part more particularly. The descrip∣tion of Oxen common. To begin therefore with their description, because among folded beastes they are of most dignity and worth, especially in Italy, where the bounds of their best priuiledged & flourishing citties, were first of all declared and layed out, by the plowing togither of an Oxe and a Cow in one yoake, Mago Carthaginensis teacheth, that the time to prouide or buy oxen, is best in the time of March, because then in their leane bodies, they which sell them cannot couer their faults so well, as if they were fatter, and also if they should be vn∣ruly and stubborne, best to prouide Oxē they may be the more easily tamed, before their flesh increase their strength. Theyr notes or markes must be these, let them be young, hauing square and great lims, a sounde body, thicke and short, hauing his muscles standing vp red and rounde, and all his body smooth, Outwarde markes of good Oxen. his hornes blacke, strong, and large, without crooking or winding, af∣ter the fashion of a halfe moone, great and rough eares, their eies and lips blacke, broad Nostrils and flat vpward, a long thicke and soft necke, his crest discending downe to the knee, a great breast, large shoulders, big belly, long straight sides, broad loynes, a straite backe discending a little, and a round paire of buttockes, straight, sounde and sinnewy, short legs, good knees, great hoofs, and long tayles rough and grisly. And it is to be no∣ted, that the oxen of a mans owne countrey breed, are better and to be preferred before strangers, because he is alredy naturaly fitted to the aire, food, water, and temper of the soile: for it is not good to bring them from the Mountaines to the valleyes, because then they will grow lazie and fat, and so into diseases; neither from the valleyes to the moun∣taines, because they will quickly grow out of hart through want of their first deep and fat pastur, and aboue all haue regard to match them equally in yoak, so as one may not over∣beare the other. Oxen loose their teeth at 2. or 3. year old, but not al as a horse doth, their nerues are harder, but not so hard as a bulles, their flesh is dry and melancholike, their horns are greater & larger then are a buls, for the same reason that Eunuchs and gelded persons can neuer be bald: Their seurall parts. for copulation weakeneth the braine, only a Bul hath a stron∣ger forehead then an oxe, because the humour that should grow forth into hornes, is har∣dned vnder the bone: and the horns of kie which are also bigger then a Buls; may tho∣rough heat be made flexible with wax or water, and bend euery way: and if when they are thus made soft, you doe slit or cut them into foure, that is, euery horne in twoe, they will so growe afterwarde, as if euery beast had foure hornes, and sometime thorough the thicknes of their scull, closing vp the part where the horne should grow, The reason why some Oxen are polled. and the smalnes of their vaines in that place to feede the hornes, there come no hornes at al, but remaine pouled; And it is reported that they haue a little stone in their head, which in the feare of death they breath out. Their teeth do al touch one another, and are changed twice, Aelianus they chew the cud like sheepe, wanting a rowe of their vpper teeth, that is foure of them, Aristotle their eies are blacke and broade, and their heart full of sinnewes, yet without any bony sub∣stance, although Pliny affirmeth that sometimes in the harts of oxen and horses are found bones. Their crest called Palea commeth of Pilus their haire, and it is nothing else but longe strakes in their haire, whereby the generosity and stomacke of the beast is apparant. Pliny The parts of a Cow diffe∣rent from Oxen. A cow hath two vdders vnder her loines with fower speans, like a goat and a sheep, because the concoction and iuice of their meat may better discend to the lower parts then to the vpper: their nauell is filled with many vaines, their haire short and soft, their taile long, with harder haire then in the other parts of the body; their melt is long and not rounde, their rains are like the raines of a sea-calfe, and by reason of their dry bodies they growe very fat, and this fat will not easily be dissolued, Galen. but their manner of feeding maintaineth their strength, for they which eat much are slowe in the chewing, and speedie in the con∣coction, for they do better preserue their fat which eate slowly, then those that eat hasti∣ly and with more greedinesse. It hath bene already shewed, The manner how Oxen feed fat. that some oxen will eat flesh and teare wild beasts in pie∣ces; and the people of Prasias giue to their yoaked or working oxen fish, Herodotus. and also in the prouince of Aden, where their horsses, sheepe, and oxen, eat dried fish, by reason that the abundance of heat doth drie vp their pasture: Paul. venet. neither is any thing so plentiful among them as fish: the like is reported of the people Horotae, and Gedrusii, and of Mosynum a cit∣ty of Thracia, and in Frisland ; in the prouince of Narbon, there is an herbe growing in wa∣ters, which is so much desired of their cattell, that they will thrust their heads into the wa∣ter aboue their eares, to bite that to the roots: and the Oxen of the Northerne Ocean I∣slands of Germany do grow so fat, that they are indangered to die thereby. The most common foode for oxen, is the same that is already specified in the former discourse of kie; namely, three leaued grasse, clauer grasse, all greene herbs, Hay, beans, Vetches, Chaffe, and in some places Barley and Straw. There is also a monethly dyet or food giuen to oxen, for in Ianuary and February, they giue them vetches, and Lupines, bruised in water among chaffe or pease so bruised and mingled, and where is want of such pulse, they may giue them pressinges of Grapes dryed and clensed, which is not turned into wine, and mingle them with chaffe for the cattell to eate, but the Grapes themselues are much better before the pressing, with their small twigges or leaues, because they are both meat and drinke; and will fat an oxe very speedily. The like may be added of Boughes, of Laurell, helme, and other leaues, and also nuts and Acornes, but if they be not wearied and fed with Acornes till they loath them, they will fall into scabs. In March and Aprill giue them hay, and from April vnto Iune giue them grasse, and such greene meat as may be found abroad; Afterward, all the Summer and Autumne, they may be satisfied with the leaues of Elme, bay, holme, and especially, that kinde of oake which is without prickles, and therefore they cannot abide Iuniper: In Nouember and December, while the seede time lasteth, they must haue as much giuen them as they can desire, either of the forenamed food, or else of some better if neede re∣quire; for it must be principally regarded, that the cartell fal not into leannesse in the win∣ter time, for leanes is the mother of many sicknesses in cattel, and their vtter ouerthrow, and therefore the benefits by their full feeding are many, as may appeare by that cōmon prouerbe, Bos ad acervum, that is [an oxe to a whole heape,] to signifie such men as liue in all plenty and aboundance. The like care must bee had of their drinke, for the Neat-heard must diligently looke vnto their drinke, that it may be alway cleare, and it is repor∣ted of the riuers Crathis and Sibaris, that the cattell which drinke of their water doe turne white, whatsoeuer colour they had in former times. The time of Oxens age They will liue in strength and perfection twelue yeares, and their whole life is for the most part but twenty, Kie liue not so long, the meanes to know their age is by their teeth and their horn, for it is obserued that their teeth grow black in their age, and their horns waxe more circled as they grow in yeares, although I dare not affirme that euery circle betokeneth a yeares groweth, [as some haue written] yet I am assured the smooth horne sheweth a young beast. Moreouer, although kie will endure much cold and heat both in Winter and Summer, yet must you haue more regard to your Oxen, and therefore it is required that they in the Winter cold weather be kept dry and housed in stals, which must be of conuenient quantity, so as euery oxe may be lodged vppon straw, the flooer made higher vnder their forefeete then their hinder, so as their vrine may passe away and not stand to hurt their hoofes: and there be also allowed for the standing and lodging of eue∣ry Oxe eight foot in bredth, and a length answerable. The like regard must be had to theyr maunger and rack, whereof the staues must not stand aboue one foot, or rather lesse from one another, that so they may not draw out their meat, and stampe it vnderfoot. But all the diet and foode that the wit of man can ordaine, will do them no manner of good if regard be not had to their bodily health, the med ins to preserue an Oxe in strength. and preseruation of strength, for which cause they must receiue an ordinary medicine euery quarter of the yeare, that is; in the end of the spring, Summer, Autumne, and Winter: which in some places is thus made and giuen in potion, they take o Cypres, and Lupine-leaues an equal quantity, beat them small, then set them in water in the open ayre a day and a night, and afterward giue vnto euery one for three dayes togither warmed as much as a wine pint. Paxamus. In other places they giue them to prevent sicknes, a raw Egge, a handfull of salte in a pint of wine: and other put into the meat of oxen, the foame of newe oyle mingled with water, first a little at once vntill they be accustomed vnto it, and afterward more, and this they do euery fourth or fift day. Cato reciteth a certaine vowe or prayer, which the olde idolatrous Romanes were woont to make for the health of their cattell, Vowes and superstitious medicins for the cure of Cattel. to Siluanus Mars, which was on this manner First, they take three pound of greene wheat, and of Larde 4. poundes, and foure pound and a halfe of fleshy sinnewes, and three pintes and a halfe of wine, then put them into earthen pots with hony, & put in the wine by it self, and this they did yearely, but no woman might knowe how it is made, or be present at the time of the preparation, and it being made must be presently consumed by fire: Vnto this ridiculous and superstitious ydle inuention, seruing more to expresse the folly of man, then to be∣nefit either man or beast, I may adde that kind of sacrifice made for beasts, which Pliny calleth Daps, that was made in the spring time when the peare-tree did blossome, the ma∣ner whereof was thus. They did offer to Iupiter Dapalis a bowle of wine, on the same daye the heard-men and heards make their sacrifice saying in this manner, O Iupiter Dapales, I offer vnto thee this cup of wine, in the behalfe of my selfe, family and cattell, if thou wilt perform that vnto them which belongeth to thee, be good to this wine beneath, be good to this my sacrifice: Afterward the party washed his handes, and then dranke the wine saying; O Iupiter Dapales be good to this my sacrifice, be good to this inferiour wine, and if thou wilt, giue part therof to Vesta : the sacrifice being ended he took Millet-seed, Len∣tils, oxipanum, and garlick: Thus farre Cato, wherewith if any reader be offended, let him remember to pitty such poore remedies, and commend his cattell to the true God, that saueth man and beast. The Druides of the Gauls, called a certain hearb growing in moyst places Samolum : which being gathered by the left hand of them that were fastinge, they gaue it for an Antidot to oxen and swine. And Galen telleth of another superstitious cure for oxen, when a man tooke the horne of a Hart, and layed it vppon the chappell of Pan, and set vpon it a burning candle which must not be forgotten, but alway thought vppon in the day time, The discoue¦ry of he sick¦nes of Cattel and the perti¦cu r cure thereof. calling vppon holy Demusaris, which foolish people haue thought as it were by a witchcraft, to cure the euils of their cattell. But to let passe these and such like trifles, let vs followe a more perfect description and rule to cure all manner of diseases in this cattel, whose safegard and health next to a mans, is to bee preferred aboue all other: and firste of all the meanes whereby their sicknesse is discouered may be considered, as all Lassitude or wearisomnesse thorough ouer much labour, which appeareth by forbearing their meat, or eating after another fashion then they are woont, or by their often lying downe, or else by holding out their tongue, all which and many more signes of their diseases, are manifest to them that haue obserued them in the time of their health, and on the other side it is manifest, that the health of an oxe may be known by his agility, life & stirring, when they are lightly touched or prick∣ed, starting, and holding their eares vpright, fulnesse of their bellie, and many other wayes. There be also hearbes which increase in cattell diuers diseases, as herbs bedewed with Honie bringeth the Murrain, the iuice of black Chamaeleon killeth yong kie like the chine, blacke Helebore, Aconitum, or Wolfe-bane, which is that grasse in cilicia, which inflameth oxen, herbe henry, and others: It is also reported by Aristotle, that in a piece of Thricia, not far from that citty which is called the cittie of Media, there is a place almost thirty fur∣longs in length, where naturally groweth a kinde of barley, which is good for men, but pernitious for beasts. The like may be said of Aegolothros, Orobanche and Aestur, but I wil hasten to the particular description of their diseases. In the first place is the Malis or Glaunders already spoken of in the storie of the Asse, The diseases which infeit Oxen & Kye which may be known by these signes, the oxes haire will be rough and hard, his eies and necke hange downe, matter running out of the nose, his pace heauie, chewing his cud little, his backe-bone sharpe, and his meat loathsome vnto him: for remedie herof, take sea-onoyns or Garlicke, Lupines or cypres, or else the foame of oile. And if a Beast care hogges-dung, they presentlie fall sicke of the Pestilence, which infecteth the hearbes and grasse they breath on, the waters whereof they drinke, and the stals and lodgings wherein they lie. The humors which annoy the body of oxen are many, the first is a moist one cal∣led Malis, yssuing at the nose, the second a dry one when nothing appeareth outwardlye onely the beast forsaketh his meat, the third an articular, when the fore or hinder legs of the beast halte, and yet the hoofes appeare sound, the fourth is Farciminous, wherein the whole body breaketh forth into matry bunches & byles, and appear healed til they break foorth in other places, the fift Subtereutanrus, when vnder the skinne there runneth a hu∣mour that breaketh forth in many places of the body: the sixt a Subrenall, when the hin∣der legs halte by reason of some paine in the loines, the seuenth a Maunge or Leprosie, and lastly a madnesse or Phrenzy, all which are contagious, and if once they enter into a heard, they will infect euery beast if they be not seperated from the sicke, and speedy re∣medy obtained. The remedies against the last seuen are thus discribed by Columella. First take Oxipanum and sea-holy roots mingled with fennel-seede and meale of beaten wheat rath-ripe: put them in spring water warmed with hony nine spoonfuls at a time, and with that medicine annoint the breast of the beaste, then take the blood of a sea-snaile, and for want thereof, a common snaile, & put it into wine, and giue the beast in at his nose, and it hath bene ap∣proued to worke effectuall. It is not good at any time to stirre vppe Oxen to running, Cursus bonū ant ciet aluū aut febrim inducit. for chasing will either moue them to loosenes of the belly, or driue them into a feauer, the nowe the signes of a feuer are these: an immoderat heat ouer the whole body, especially about the mouth, tongue, and eares, teares falling out of the eies, hollownes of their eyes, a heauy and stooping drowzie head, matter running out of his nose, a hotte and difficulte breath, and sometime fighing and violent beating of his vaines and loathing of meat: for remedy whereof let the beast fast one whole day, then let him be let blood vnder the taile fasting, and afterward make him a drinke of bole-wort stalkes sod with oyle and lickquor of fish-sauce, and so let him drinke it for fiue daies togither before he eat meat; afterward let him eat the tops of Lentils, and young small vine braunches, then keepe his nose and mouth clean with a spunge, and giue him colde water to drinke three times a day, for the best meanes of recouery are cold meates and drinkes, neither must the beast bee turned out of dores, till he be recouered: When an oxe is sicke of a cold, giue him blacke wine and it will presently helpe him. If an Oxe in his meate tast of hens doung, his belly wil presently be tormented, and swell vnto death if remedie be not giuen: for this mallady, take three ounces of parsley seed, a pint and a halfe of Cummin, two pounds of honey, beat these togither and put it down his throat warme, then driue the beast vp and down, as long as he can stand, then let as many as can stand about him rub his belly, vntil the medicine worke to purgation: and Vegetius addeth, that the ashes of Elme wood well sod in oyle, and put downe the beasts throat, cureth the inflamation of hen-dung. If at any time it happen, that an oxe get into his mouth and throate a horse-leech, which at the first will take fast holde, and sucke the place she holds [be it mouth or throat] till she haue kild the beast: if you canot take hold on her with the hand, then put into the oxes throat a Cane, or little hollow pipe, euen to the place where the leech sucketh, and into that pipe put warme oyle, which as soone as the leech feeleth, she presently leaueth hold. It fortuneth sometimes that an oxe is stung or bitten with a Serpent, Adder, Viper, or other such venimous beast; for that wound, take sharpe Trifoly, which groweth in rocky places, straine out the iuice and beat it with salte, then scarifie the wound with that oynt∣ment, till it be wrought in. If a field-mouse bite an Oxe, so as the dint of her teeth appear, then take a little commin and soft Pitch, and with that make a plaister for the wound: or if you can get another field-Mouse, put her into oyle, and there let it remaine till the mē∣bers of it be almost rotten, then bruise it & lay it to the sore, and the same body shal cure, whose nature gaue the wound. Oxen are also much troubled with a disease called the hide∣bound; for remedy whereof, when the beast is taken from his worke, and panteth, then let him be sprinkled ouer with wine, and put peeces of fatte into his mouth: if then you perceiue no amendment, then seeth some Laurell, and therewith heat his backe, and af∣terward with oyle and wine scarifie him all ouer, plucking his skin vp from the ribbes, and this must be done in the sunshine, or else in a very warme place. For the scabs, take the iuice of Garlicke, and rub the beast all ouer; and with this me∣dicine may the biting of a Wolfe or a mad dogge be cured: although other affirme, that the hoofe of any beast with Brimstone, oyle, Water, and Vineger, is a more present re∣medy; but there is no better thinge then butter and stale Vrine: When they are vexed with wormes, poure cold water vpon them, afterward annoint them with the iuice of o∣nions mingled with salt. If an oxe be wrinched and strayned in his sinnewes, in trauell or labour, by stumping on any roote or hard sharpe thing, then let the contrary foot or legge be let blood, if the sin∣news swel: If his necke svvell let him blood, or if his necke be vvinding and vveake [as if it were broken] then let him blood in that eare to which side the head bendeth. When their neckes be bald, grind two tiles togither, a nevv one and a olde, and vvhen the yoake is ta∣ken off, cast the pouder vpon their neckes, and afterwarde oyle, and so with a little rest the haire vvill come againe. When an oxe hangeth dovvne his eares and eateth not his meat, he is troubled vvith a Cephalalgie: that is, a paine in his head: for vvhich, seeth Thyme in vvine, vvith salt and Garlicke, and therevvith rub his tongue a good space; also ravv barly steeped in Wine, helpeth this disease. Sometime an oxe is troubled vvith madnesse, for vvhich men burne them betvvixt the hornes in the forehead, till they bleed, sometime there is a Fly vvhich biting them continually, driueth them into madnesse; for vvhich they are vvoont to cast brimstone, and bay sprigs sod in water in the pastures where they feede, but I knovv not vvhat good can come thereby. When oxen are troubled vvith fleam, put à sprig of black Hellebore throgh their ears, wherein let it remain til the next day at the same houre. Al the euils of the eyes are for the most part cured by infusion of hony, and some mingle there∣vvith Ammoniacke, Salt, and Boeticke. When the pallat or roofe of their mouth is so swel∣led that the beast forsaketh meat, and bendeth one the one side, let his mouth be pared with a sharpe instrument, or else burned or abated some other way, giuing them greene and soft meat til the tender sore be cured: but vvhen the cheekes svvell, for remedy thereof, they sell them avvay to the butcher for slaughter: it falleth out very often that there grow certaine bunches on their tongues, vvhich make them forsake their meate, and for this thing they cut the toong, and aftervvard rub the wound vvith garlicke and salt, till al the fleamy matter yssue forth. VVhen their vaines in their cheeks and chaps swell out into vlcers, they soften and wash them with vineger and lees, till they be cured. When they are liuer-sicke, they giue them Rubarbe, Mishroms, and Gentian, mingled togither. For the cough and short breath, they giue them twigs of vines, or Iuniper mingled with salt; and some vse Betony. There is a certaine hearbe called Asplenon or Citterach, which consumeth the Melts of Oxen, found by this occasion: in creete there is a Ryuer called Protereus, running be∣twixt the two citties Gnoson and Gortina, on both sides thereof there were heards of cat∣tell, but those which fed neere to Gortina had no Spleene, and the other which fed neer to Gnoson were full of Spleene: when the Physitians endeuored to finde out the true cause heereof, they found an hearbe growing on the coast of Gortina, which diminished their Spleene; and for that cause called it Asplenon. But now to come to the diseases of their brest and stomack, and first of al to begine with the cough, which if it be new, may be cured by a pint of Barly Meale with a raw Egge, and halfe a pint of sod wine: and if the cough be old, take two pounds of beaten Hysop sod in 3. pints of water, beatē Lentils, or the roots of onyons washed and baked with Wheate meale giuen fasting, do driue away the oldest cough. For shortnesse of breath, their Neat-heardes hang about their Necke deathes-hearb and harts-wort; but if their Liuers or lungs be corupted [which appeareth by along cough and leannes] take the root of hasell, and put it through the Oxes eare; then, a like or equall quantity of the iuyce of Onyons and oyle mingled, and put into a pint of Wine, let it be giuen to the beast many daies together. If the Oxe be troubled with cru∣dity, or a raw euill stomach, you shall know by these signes; he wil often belch, his belly will rumble, he will forbeare his meate, hanging down his eies, and neither chew the cud or licke himselfe with his tongue: for remedy whereof, take two quarts of warme Water, thirty stalkes of Bole-worts, seeth them together till they be soft, and then giue them to the beast with vineger. But if the crudity cause his belly to stand out and swell, then pull his tayle downe∣warde with all the force that you can, and binde thereunto Mother-wort, mingled with salt, or else giue them a glister, or anoint a Womans hand with oyle, and let hir draw out the dung from his fundament; and afterward cut a vaine, in his tayle vvith a sharp knife. When they be distempered with choler, burne their Legs to the hoofes vvith a vvhot I∣ron, and aftervvard let them rest vpon cleane and soft stravv: vvhen their guts and intrals are payned they are eased vvith the sight of a Duck or a Drake. But vvhen the small guts are infected, take fifteene cypres aples and so many gaules, mingle and beate them vvith their vvaight of old cheese in foure pints of the sharpest Wine you can get, and so diuide it into foure parts, giuing to the beast euery day one quantity. The excrements of the belly doe depriue the body of all strength and power to labour; wherefore vvhen they are troubled vvith it, they must rest, and drinke nothing for three dayes together, and the first day let them forbeare meate, the second day giue them the toppes of wilde Olyues, or in defect thereof, canes, or reedes; the stalkes of Lantiske and Myrtill ; and the thirde day a little Water, and vnto this some adde dryed Grapes in sixe pintes of sharpe Wine, giuen euery day in like quantity. When their hinder parts are lame through congealed blood in them, whereof there is no outward ap∣pearance, take a bunch of Nettles with their rootes and put it into their mouthes, by rub∣bing whereof the condersate blood will remoue away. When Oxen come first of all after Winter to grasse, they fall grasse-sicke, and pisse blood; for which they seeth together in water barley, bread, and larde, and so giue them altogether in a drinke to the beast: some praise the kernels of Walenuts put into Egge∣shels for this cure, and other take the bloody water it selfe and blow it into the beastes Nostrils; and heard-men by experience haue found, that there is no better thing then hearb-Robert, to stay the pissing of blood: they must also be kept in a stall within doores, and be fed with dry grasse and the best hay. If their hornes be annoynted with wax, oyle, and pitch, they feele no payne in their hoofes; except in cases where any beast treadeth and presseth anothers hoofe; in which case, take oyle and sod Wine, and then vse them in a whot barley plaister or poultase layed to the wounded place: but if the plough share hurt the Oxes foote, then lay thereunto stone-pitch, Grease, and Brimstone, hauing first of all seared the wound with a whot Iron bound about with shorne wool. Now to returne to the taming and instruction of Oxen. It is said that Busiris King of Egypt was the first that euer tamed or yoaked Oxen, hauing his name giuen him for that purpose. Oxen are by nature meeke, gentle, slow, and not stubborne; bycause being de∣priued of his genitals he is more tractable, and for this cause it is requisite that they bee alwaie vsed to hand, and to be familiar with man, that he may take bread at his hand, and be tyed vp to the racke, for by gentlenesse they are best tamed, being thereby more wil∣ling and strong for labour, then if they were roughly yoaked or suffered to run wild with∣out the society and sight of men. Varro sayth, that it is best to tame them betwixt fiue and three yeare old, for before three it is to soone, bycause they are too tender; and after fiue it is too late, by reason they are too vnwealdy and stubborne. But if any be taken more wild and vnruly, take this direction for their taming: first, if you haue any old tamed oxen, how to tame or yoke wild Oxen. ioyne them together [a wilde and a tame] and if you please, you may make a yoake to holde the Neckes of three oxen; so that if the beast would rage and be disobedient, then will the old one both by example and strength draw hlm on, keeping him from starting aside, and falling down. They must also be accusto∣med to draw an empty cart, waine, or sled through some towne or village, where there is som concourse of people, or a plow in valloed ground or sand, so as the beast may not be discouraged by the waight and strength of the businesse, their keeper must often with his owne hand giue them meate into their mouth, and stroke their Noses, that so they may be acquainted with the smell of a man; and likewise put his hand to their sides, and stroke them vnder their belly, whereby the beast may feele no displeasure by being tou∣ched. In some countries, they wash them all ouer with Wine for two or three dayes to∣gither, and afterward in a horne giue them wine to drinke, which doth wonderfully tame them, although they haue beene neuer so Wilde: other put their Neckes into engins, and tame them by substracting their meate: other affirme, that if a wilde oxe be tyed with a halter made of Wooll, Rasis. he will presently waxe tame: but to this I leaue euery man to his particular inclination for this businesse; onely, let them chaunge their oxens sides, and set them sometime on the right side, and sometime on the lefte side, and beware that he auoide the Oxes heele, for if once he get the habite of kicking, he wil very hardlye be refrained from it againe. He hath a good memory, and will not forget the man that pricked him whereas he wil not stirre at another, being like a man in fetters, who dissem∣bleth vengance vntill he be released, and then paieth the person that hath grieued him. Wherefore it is not good to vse a young oxe to a goad: but rather to awaken his dulnesse with a whip. The vnder∣standing of Oxen. These beasts do vnderstand their owne names, and distinguish betwixt the voice of their keepers and strangers. They are also said to remember and vnderstand numbers, for the King of Persia had certaine Oxen, which euery day drew water to Susis to water his Gar∣dens, Guidus. their number was an hundred vessels, which through custom they grew to obserue, and therefore not one of them would halt or loyter in that businesse, till the whole was ac∣complished: Aelianus but after the number fulfilled, there was no goad, whip, or other meanes, could once make them stir, to fetch another draught or burthen. They are said to loue their fellowes with whom they draw in yoake most tenderly, whom they seeke out with mourning if he be wanting. The loue of oxen to their yoke-fellow It is likewise obserued in the licking of themselues against the haire, (but as Cicero saith) if he bend to the right side and licke that, it presageth a storme; but if he bend to the left side, of the licking of Oxen, na∣tural obser∣uations. he foretelleth a calmy faire day: In like manner, when he lowgheth and smelleth to the earth, or when he feedeth fuller then ordinary, it betoke∣neth chang of weather: but in the Autumn, if sheep or Oxen dig the earth with their feet, or lie downe head to head, it is held for an assured token of a tempest. Their aptnes to go astray. They feede by companies and flockes, and their nature is to follow any one which straieth away; for if the neat-heard be not present to restraine them, they wil all follow to their owne danger. Being angred and prouoked they will fight with strangers very ireful∣ly, The anger of Oxen & kye. with vnapeaseable contention: for it was seene in Rhaetia, betwixt Curia and Velcuria that when the heardes of two villages meete in a certaine plaine together, they fought so longe, that of threescore, foure and twenty were slaine, and all of them wounded, [eight excepted] which the inhabytantes tooke for anill presage or mischiefe of some ensuing calamitye, and therefore they would not suffer their bodyes to bee couered with earth: to auoyde this contention, skilfull Neate-heardes giue their Cattell some strong hearbes, as garlike and such like, that the sauour may auert that strife They which come about Oxen, Buls, and bugils, must not weare any red Garments, Gillius Oxen prouo¦ked by cou∣lours. by cause their nature ryseth and is prouoked to rage, if they see such a colour. There is great enmity betwixt Oxen and Wolues, for the Wolfe [being a flesh-ea∣ting-creature] lyeth in waite to destroy them; and it is said, that there is so great a natural feare in them, that if a Wolues tayle bee hanged in the racke or manger where an Oxe feedeth, he will abstaine from eating. This beast is but simple, though his aspect seeme to be very graue; and thereof came the prouerbe of the Oxen to the yoke, Rasis. which was cal∣led Ceroma ; wherewithall Wrastlers and Prize-players were anointed, but when a foolish and heauy man was annoynted they said ironically Bos ad ceroma. Againe the folly of this beast appearerh by another Greeke prouerbe, which saith, that An Oxe raiseth dust which blindeth his owne eyes : to signifie, that foolish and indiscrete men stirre vp the occasion of their owne harmes. The manifold Epithets giuen this beast in Greeke and Latine by sundry authors, doe demonstratiuely shew the manifold conditi∣ons of this beast; as that it is called a Plower, Wilde, an earth tiller, brazen footed, by reason of his hard hoofes [ Cerebrons ] more brayne then wit; horned, stubborne, horne-striking, hard, rough, vntamed, deuourer of grasse, yoake-bearer, fearefull, ouertamed, drudges, vvry-faced, slovv, and ill fauored, vvith many other such notes of their nature, ordination, and condition. There remaine yet of this discourse of Oxen, tvvo other necessary Tractats ; The naturall vses of the se¦ueral parts of Oxen. the one naturall & the other morral. That vvhich is natural, contayns the seueral vses of their par¦ticular parts: & first for their flesh, which is held singular for norishment, for which cause, after their labour which bringeth leannesse, they vse to put them by for sagination, or [as it is sayd] in English for feeding, which in all countries hath a seuerall manner or custom. How to fattē cattaile. Sotion affirmeth, that if you giue your cattell when they come fresh from their pasture, Cabbage leaues beaten small with some sharpe vineger poured among them, and after∣ward chaffe winowed in a siefe, and mingled with branne for fiue daies together, it will much fatten and encrease their flesh, and the sixth day ground barley, encreasing the quantity by little and little for sixe dayes together. Now the best time to feede them in the Winter is about the cock-crowing, and after∣ward in the morning twy-light, and soone after that let them drinke: in the Summer let them haue their first meate in the morning, and their second seruice at noone, and then drinke after that second meate or eating, and their third meate before euening againe, and so let them drinke the second time; It is also to be obserued that their water in winter time be warmed, and in the Summer time colder. And while they feede you must often wash the roofe and sides of their mouth, for therein will grow certaine Wormes which will annoy the beast and hinder his eating, and after the washing rubbe his tongue wel with salt. If therefore they be carefully regarded they wil grow very fat, especially if they be not ouer aged or very young at the time of their feeding: for by reason of age their teeth grow loose and fall out, and in youth they cannot exceede in fatnesse bycause of their groweth: aboue all heighfers and barren Kye will exceed in fatnesse, for Varro affir∣meth, that he saw a field Mouse bring forth young ones in the fat of a cowe hauing eaten into her body she being aliue: the selfe same thing is reported of a Sow in Arcadia : A strange re∣port of a fat Cow, if true. Kye will also grow fat when they are with calfe especially in the middest of that time. The Turks vse in their greatest feastes and Marriages, to rost or seeth an Oxe whole, putting in the oxes belly a whole Sovv, and in the Sowes belly, a Goose, and in the Gooses belly an Egge, to note forth their plenty in great and small things: but the best flesh is of a young oxe, and the worst of an olde one, for it begetteth an ill iuyce or concoction, especially if they which eate it be troubled vvith a cough or reumy fleame, or if the party be in a consumption, or for a woman that hath vlcers in her belly, the tongue of an oxe or cow salted and slit asunder, is accompted a very delicate dishe, vvhich the priestes of Mercury sayd did belong to them, bycause they vvere the seruants of speech, and hovvsoeuer in al sacrifices the beasts tongue vvas refused as a prophane member, yet these priests made choise thereof, vnder colour of sacrifice to feede their dainty stomacks. The hornes of oxen by art of man are made very flexible and straight whereof are made combes, hasts for kniues, and the ancients haue vsed them for cups to drinke in, and for this cause was Bacchus painted with hornes, and Crater was taken for a cup, which is deriued of Kera a horne: In like manner the first Trumpets were made of hornes as Vir∣gill alludeth vnto this sentence, Rauco strepuerunt cornua cantu, and now a daies it is be∣come familier for the carriage of Gun-pouder in warre. It is reported by some husband∣men, that if seede be cast into the earth out of an Oxes horne (called in old time cerasbo∣la ) by reason of a certaine coldnesse, it well neuer spring vp well out of the earth, at the least not so well as when it is sowed with the hand of man. Their skinne is vsed for shooes, Garments, and Gumme, because of a spongy matter therein contayned, also to make Gun-pouder, and it is vsed in nauigation when a shot hath pierced the sides of the ship, presently they clap a raw Oxe hyde to the mouth of the breach, which instantly keepeth the Water from entring in: likewise they were wont to make Bucklers or shieldes of the hides of Oxen and Bugils, and the seuen-folded or doubled shield of Aiax, was nothing else but a shield made of an Oxe hyde, so many times layed one piece vpon another, which caused Homer to call it Sacos heptaboeion. Of the teeth of Oxen I know no other vse but scraping and making Paper smooth with them; their gall being sprinkled among seede which is to be sowen maketh it come vppe quickly, and killeth field-mise that tast of it, and it is the bayne or poyson of those crea∣tures: so that they will not come neere to it, no not in bread if they discerne it; and birds if they eate corne touched with an Oxes gall put into hot water first of all, and the lees of Wyne, they wax thereby astonished: likewise Emmets will not come vppon those places where there remaineth any sauour of this gall; and for this cause they anoynt heerewith the rootes of trees. The dung of Oxen is beneficiall to Bees if the Hyue bee annoynted therewith, for it killeth Spiders, Gnats, and drone-bees; and if good heede be not taken, it will worke the like effect vpon the Bees themselues: for this cause they vse to smother or burne this kinde of dung vnder the mouthes of the Hiues in the spring time, which so displayeth and disperseth all the little enemy-bees in Bee-hiues that they neuer breed againe. There is a prouerbe of the stable of Angia ; which Angia was so rich in cattell, that he defiled the countrey with their dung, whereupon that prouerbe grew: when Hercules came vnto him he promised him a part of his countrey to purge that sta∣ble, which was not clensed by the yearely labour of 3000. Oxen, but Hercules vndertaking the labour turned a Ryuer vpon it, and so clensed all. When Angia saw that his stable was purged by art, and not by labour, he denyed the reward; and because Phyleus his eldest sonne reproued him for not regarding a man so well deseruing, he cast him out of his fa∣mily for euer. The manifold vse of the members of Oxen and Kye in medicyne, now remaineth to be briefely touched. The horne beaten into pouder, cureth the cough, especially the types or point of the horne, which is also receiued against the ptisicke, or short breath made into pils with Hony. The pouder of a Cowes horne mixed with vineger, help∣eth the morphew, being washed or annoynted therewith. The same infused into the Nostrils, stayeth the bleeding: likewise mingled with warme water and vineger, giuen to a Splenet cke man for three dayes together, the medcins of the seueral parts of oxen and Kye it wonderfully worketh vpon that passion: pouder of the hoofe of an Oxe with water put vpon the kings euill helpeth it, and with Water and Hony it helpeth the apostemes and swelling of the body: and the same bur∣ned and put into drinke, and given to a Woman that lacketh Milke, it encreaseth milke and strengtheneth hir very much. Other take the tongue of a cow, which they dry so long till it may be beaten into pouder, and so giue it to a woman in white wine or broath. The dust of the heele of an oxe or ancle bone, taken in Wine and put to the gummes or teeth doe fasten them, Rasis. and remoue the ache away: The ribbes of oxen beaten to pouder doe stay the fluxe of blood, Fu nerius. and restrain the aboundance of monthly courses in women. The ancle of a white cow layed forty daies and nightes into wine, and rubbed on the face with white linnet, taketh spots and maketh the skinne looke very cleare. Where a man biteth any other liuing creature, seeth the flesh of an oxe or a calfe, and after fiue dayes lay it to the sore, and it shall worke the ease thereof. The flesh being warme layed to the swellings of the body, easeth them: so also doe the warme blood and gall of the same beast. The broath of beefe healeth the loosnesse of the bellye, comming by reason of choler; and the broath of cowes flesh, or the marrow of a cow, healeth the vlcers and chinkes of the mouth. The skinne of an oxe [especially the leather thereof] worne in a shooe, bur∣ned and applyed to pimples in the body or face, cureth them. The skinne of the feete and Nose of an oxe or sheepe, sod ouer a soft and gentle fire, vntill there arise a certaine scumme like to glue from it, and afterward dried in the cold, windye aire, and drunk, help∣eth [or at least] easeth burstnesse very much. The marrow of an oxe, or the sewet, helpeth the straynes of sinnewes if they be anoin∣ted therewith. If one make a small candle of paper and cowes marrow, setting the same on fire vnder his browes or eye-lids which are balde, without haire, and often annoynting the place, he shall haue very decent and comely haire grow thereupon. Likewise the se∣wet of oxen helpeth against all outward poyson: so in all Leprosies, botches, and scurui∣nesse of the skinne, the same mingled with Goose grease, and poured into the eares, help∣eth the deafenesse of them. It is also good against the inflammation of the eares, the stu∣pidity and dulnesse of the teeth, the running of the eyes, the vlcers and rimes of the mouth, and stiffenesse of the neck. If ones blood be liquid and apt to runne forth of the body, it may be well thickned and retayned, by drinking Oxe blood mingled with vine∣ger: & the blood of a cow poured into a wound that bleedeth, stayeth the blood. Likwise the blood of Oxen cureth the scabs in Dogs. Concerning their Milke, volumes may be written of the seuerall and manifold vertues thereof, for the Arcadians refused all medicine, onely in the spring time when their beasts did eate grasse, they dranke cowes Milke, being perswaded, Pliny A History that the vertue and vigour of al good hearbs and fruits were receiued and digested into that liquor; for they gaue it me∣dicinally to them which were sicke of the Prisicke, of consumption, of an old cough, of the consumption of the raynes, of the hardnesse of the belly, and of all manner poysons which burne inwardly; which is also the opinion of all the Greeke Physitians: and the shell of a Walnut sod in cow-milke and layed to the place where a serpent hath bitten, it cureth it, and stayeth the poyson. The same being new and warme Gargarized into the throate, helpeth the sorenesse of the kernels, and all payne in the arteries, and swelling in the throate and stomacke: and if any man bee in danger of a short breath, let him take daylie softe pitch with the hearbe Mummie, and harts-suet clarified in a Cup of new Milke, and it hath beene proued very profitable. Where the paynes of the stomacke come by sadnesse, Melancholy, or desperation, drinke Cow-milke, Womans Milke, or Asses-milke, wherein a flint-stone hath beene sodden. When one is troubled with a desire of going often to the stoole, and can egest nothing, let him drinke cow-milke and Asse-milke sod together; the same also heated with gads of Iron or Steele, and mingled with one fourth part of water, helpeth the bloody flix; mingled with a little Hony and a Buls gall, with cummin and gourds layed to the Nauell: and some affirme, that cow-milke doth help conception, if a woman be troubled with the white fluxe, so that hir wombe be indaungered, let her drinke a purgation for hir vpper partes, and afterward Asses milke, last of all let her drinke cow-milke and new wine, (for forty daies together if neede be) so mingled that the wine appeare not in the milke, and it shall stay the fluxe. But in the vse of milke, the rule of Hipocrates must be continual∣ly obserued, that it be not vsed with any sharpe ot tart liquor, for then it curdleth in the stomack, and turneth into corruption. The whay of cow-milke mingled with Hony and salt, as much as the tast will permit and drunke, looseneth the hardnesse of the Belly. The marrow of a cow mingled with a little meale, and with new cheese, wonderfully stayeth the bloody flixe. It is affirmed, that there is in the head of an oxe, a certaine little stone, which onely in the feare of death he casteth out at his mouth, if this stone be taken from them suddenly by cutting the head, it doth make children to breed teeth easily, be∣ing soone tyed about them. If a man or woman, drinke of the same water, whereof an oxe drunke a little before, it wil ease the head-ache: and in the second venter of a cow there is a round blacke Tophus found, being of no waight, which is accounted very profitable to Wommen in hard trauailes of child-birth. The Liuer of an oxe or cow dryed, and drunke in pouder, cureth the fluxe of blood. The gall of a cow is more forcible in opera∣tion then all other beastes gals whatsoeuer. The gall of an Oxe mixed with hony, draw∣eth out any thorne or point of a needle or other Iron thing out of the flesh where it stick∣eth. Likewise it being mingled with alome and Myrrhe as thicke as hony, it cureth those euils which creepe and annoy the priuy partes; laying vpon it afterward Beetes sod in Wine. It will not suffer the Kings euil to grow or spread it selfe if it be laied vpon it at the be∣ginning. The hands washed in an oxes gall and water, are made white how blacke soeuer they were before time; and if pur-blind eyes be annoynted with the gal of a blacke cow, one may read any writing the more plainely: there is in the gal of an oxe a certaine little stone like a ring, which the Phylosophers cal Alcheron, [and some Guers and Nassatum ] which being beaten and held to ones Nose, it cleareth the eyes, and maketh that no hu∣mour do distil to annoy them: and if one take thereof the quantity of a lintell seed, with the iuyce of Beetes, it is profitable against the falling euil. If one be deafe or thicke of hearing, take the gal of an oxe and the vrine of a Goate; or the gall of a Goose: likewise, it easeth the head-ache in an Ague, and applyed to the temples prouoketh sleepe, and if the breasts of a woman be annoynted therwith it keepes her milke from curdling. The melt of an oxe is eaten in hony for easing the paynes of the melt in a man, and with the skin that a calfe cast out of his dammes belly, the vlcers in the face are taken away: and if twenty heads of Garlicke be beaten in an oxes bladder, with a pinte of vineger and layed to the backe, it will cure the melt. It is likewise giuen against the Spleene, and the cholicke made like a plaster, and layed to the nauell til one sweat. The vrine of an Oxe causeth a cold stomacke to recouer, and I haue seen that the vrine of a cow, taken in Gargarizing, did cure intollerable vlcers in the mouth. When the bee hath tasted of the flower of the corne-tree, she presently dyeth by loosenesse of the bel∣ly, except she tast the vrine of a man or an Oxe. There are likewise many vses of the dung of Oxen made in Physicke, whereof authors are full, but especially against the goute, plastering the sicke member therewith whot and newly made: and against the Dropsie, making a plaster thereof with Barley meale and a little Brimston aspersed, to couer the belly of a man: And thus much for the natural pro∣perties of this kind, now we will briefely proceed to the morall. The morral and external vse of Oxen both for la∣bour & other industry. The morall vses of this beast, both in labour and other things doth declare the dignity and high account our forefathers made heereof, both in vintage, haruest, plowing, car∣riage, drawing, sacrificing, and making Leagues of truce and peace; in somuch as, that if this fayled, al tilage and vintage must in many places of the world be vtterly put down; and in truth, neither the Foules of the aire, nor the Horsse for the battaile, nor the Swine and Dogges could haue no sustenance but by the labor of Oxen: for although in some places they haue Mules, or Cammels, or Elephants, which help them in this labour, yet can there not be in any Nation a neglect of Oxen; Ʋarro. and their reuerence was so great, that in auncient time when an offendor was to be fined in his cattel [as al amerciaments were in those daies] the Iudge might not name an Oxe, vntil he had first named a Sheepe; and they fined a smal offence at two sheepe and not vnder, and the greatest offence criminal, at thirty oxen and not aboue, which were redeemed, by giuing for euery oxe an hundred Asses, and ten for euery sheepe. It is some question among the ancients, who did first ioyne Oxen together for plow∣ing: Heraclides some affirming, that Aristeus first learned it of the Nymphs, in the Island Co: and Dio∣dorus affirmeth, that Dionisius Sonne of Iupiter, and Ceres or Proserpina, did first of al in∣uent the plow. Some attribute it to Briges the Athenian, other to Triptolemus, Osiris, Ha∣bides a King of Spaine; and Virgill affirmeth most constantly, that it was Ceres as appear∣reth by this verse; Prima Ceres ferro mortales vertere terram, Instituit, &c. Whereunto agreeth Sernius: but I rather encline to Iosephus, Lactantius, and Eusebi∣us, who affirme; that long before ceres was borne, or Osiris, or Hercules, or any of the resi∣due, their was a practise of plowing, both among the Haebrewes and the Egyptians ; and therefore as the God of plowing called by the Romaines Iugatinus (because of yoaking Oxen) was a fond aberration from the truth, so are the residue of their inuentions, about the first man that tilled with Oxen: seeing that it is saide of Cain and Noah, Augustinus that they were husbandmen and tilled the earth. The Athenians had three seuerall plow-feastes which they obserued yearely, one in Scirus, the other in Rharia, and the thirde vnder Pelintus : and they called their marriage feasts plow-seasons, because then they endeuored by the seed of man to multiply the world, in procreation of children, as they did by the plow to encrease food in the earth. The Graecians had a kind of writing called Boustraphedon, which beganne, turned, and ended as the Oxen doe in plowing a furrow, continuing from the left hande to the right, and from the right hand to the left againe, which no man could read, but hee that turned the Paper or table at euery lines end. It is also certaine, that in auncient time, the leagues of truce and peace were written in an Oxes hide, as appeareth by that peace which was made by Tarquinius, betwixt the Romaines and the Gabij, the which was hanged vp in the Temple of Iupiter, as Dionisius and Pompeius Sextus affirme (in the likenesse of a buckler or shield:) and the chiefe heads of that peace remained legible in that hide, vnto their time, and therefore the ancients called the Oxes hide a shield, in regard that by that conclusion of peace, they were defended from the wars of the Gabij. And there were certaine people called Homolotti by Herodotus, who were woont to strike vp their leagues of peace after Warre and contention, by cutting an Oxe into smal peeces, which were deuided among the people that were to be vnited, in token of an in∣seperable vnion. There be that affirme, that a Teame or yoake of Oxen, taking six or eight to the Teame, will plow euery yeare, or rather euery season a hyde of ground; that is, as some account, 20. Mansa, or in English and German account, 30. Acres: which hath got∣ten the name Iugera from this occasion, as Eustathius, and varinus report. A History When Sychaeus the husband of Dido, who was Daughter of Agenor and sister to Pigmalion, wandered too and fro in the world with great store of treasure, hee was slaine by Pigmalion secretly, in hope to get his wealth: After which time, it is saide that he appeared to his wife Dido, bid∣ding her to saue her life from her cruell brother; who more esteemed money then nature, she fled into Lybia, taking with her some Tyrians, among whome she had dwelled, and a competent sum of money: who being come thither, craued of Iarbas King of Nomades, to giue her but so much land as she could compasse in with an oxes hide, which with much ado she obtained, and then did cut an Oxes skinne into smal and narrow thongs or listes, wherewithall shee compassed in so much as builded the large citty of carthage, and firste of all was called the newe cittye, and the castle thereof Byrsa ; which signifieth a Hyde. Eustathius also reporteth another story to the building of this citty, namely that it was called carthage of one of the Daughters of Hercules, and that when Elisa and the other companions of Dido came thither to digge for the foundation of the citty, they found an Oxes head, whereupon they were discouraged to build there any more, supposing that Omen betokened euill vnto them, and a perpetuall slauery in labour and misery, such as Oxen liue in, but afterward they tryed in another corner of that grounde, wherein they found a Horsses head which they accepted for a good signification of riches honor, mag∣nanimity, and pleasure, because Horsses haue al food and maintainance prouided for thē. Clemens Among the Egyptians they paint a Lyon for strength, an Oxe for labor, and a horse for magnanimity and corage, & the Image of Myrtha which among the Persians signifieth the Sunne, is pictured in the face of a Lyon holding the hornes of a striuing Oxe in both hands, whereby they signifie that the Moon doth receiue light from the Sunne, Gyraldus when she beginneth to be seperated from her beames. There is in the coastes of Babylon a gemme or precious stone like the hearte of an Oxe, and there is another called Sarcites, which representeth the flesh of an Oxe. Pliny. The auncientes had likewise so great regarde of this Beast, that they would neither sacrifice nor eate of a labouring Oxe; wherefore Hercules was condemned when he had desired meate of Theodomantis in Dyropia for his hungry companion the Sonne of Hyla, be∣cause by violence he tooke from him one of his Oxen and slewe him. A crowned Oxe was also among the Romanes a signe of peace, for the Souldiors which kept the Ca∣stle of Anathon neere the riuer Euphrates against Iulianus and his Army, when they yeel∣ded themselues to mercy, Marcellus they discended from the Castle, driuing before them a crow∣ned Oxe: from this manifold necessity and dignity of this beast came the Idolatrous cu∣stome of the Heathens and especially the Egytians, for they haue worshipped him instead of God calling him Apis and Ephaphus : Idolatry cō∣mitted with Oxen and Kye, of the choise of A∣pis. whose choyse was on this sort. He had on his right side an exceeding splendant white spot, and his Hornes crooking togither like the newe Moone, hauing a great bunch on his tongue, which they call Cantharus : neither do they suffer him to exceed a certaine number of yeares or grow very big, for these causes they giue him not of the water of Nilus to drinke, but of another consecrated well, which hin∣dereth his growth: and also when hee is come to his full age, they kill him, by drowning him in another consecrated well of the Priests: which being done they seeke with mour∣ning another (hauing shaued their heades) to substitute in his place, wherein they are ne∣uer very long but they finde one, and then in a holy shippe sacred for that purpose, they transport and conuey him to Memphis. And the Egyptians did account him a blessed and happy man, out of whose folde the Priestes had taken that Oxe-God. He hath two Tem∣ples erected for him, which they cal his chambers, where he giueth foorth his augurisms, aunswering none but children and youthes playing before his Temples: and refusing aged persons especially Women, and if any not sacred happen to enter into one of his Tem∣ples, he dieth for it, and if into the other it fore-sheweth some monstrous curssed euent, as they fondly imagine. The manner of his answeres is priuately to them that giue him meat, taking it at theyr hands, and they obserue with great religion that when Germanicus the Emperour came to aske counsell of him, he turned from him and woulde not take meate at his hande, for presently after he was slaine. Once in a yeare they shew him a Cow, with such markes as he hath, A history and alway they put him to death vpon the same day of the weeke that he was founde, and in Nilus neere Memphis there was a place called Phiala where were preserued a Golden and a siluer dish, which vpon the birth or caluing daies of Apis, they threw down into the riuer and those daies were seauen, wherein they affirme that neuer man was hurt by Cro∣codils. The Egyptians do also consecrate an Oxe to the Moone, and a Cow to Vrania. It is reported that Mycerinus K. of Egypt, fell in loue with his own Daughter: and by violence did rauish her, Herodotus a history shee not able to endure the conscience of such a fact, hanged her selfe: whereupon the King her impure father, did bury her in a wooden Oxe, and so placed her in a secret place or chamber, to whome daily they offer many odours, but the mother of the maiden did cut off the hands of those Virgins or women that attended on her Daugh∣ter and would not rescue her from so vile a contempt. There were also many other picturs of Oxen, Of the pictu¦res of Oxen. as in corcyra and Eretria, and most famous was that of perillus which he made and presented to Phalaris the Tyraunt of Agrigent, shewing him, that if he would torment a man, he should put him into that Oxe set ouer a fire, and his voice of crying shoulde bee like the loughing of a Heighfer, which thing being heard of the Tyraunt to shew his dete∣station of more strange inuented torments then he had formerly vsed, he caused Perillus that presented it vnto him to be put into it aliue, & so setting it ouer a fire, made experi∣ment of the worke vpon the workeman, who bellowed like a Cow, and was so tormented to death for that damnable and daungerous inuention, which caused Ouid to write thus. Et phalaris Tauro violentus membra perilli: Torruit, infoelix imbuit author opus. When an Oxe or a Cow in auntient time did die of themselues, (Viz:) if it were an Oxe, they buried him vnder the wals of some Citty, leauing his Hornes sticking visibly out of the earth, to signifie the place of his buriall, for when his flesh was consumed, they tooke it vp againe, and buried the bones in the Temples of Venus in other places: but the body of a deade cowe they cast into some great Riuer neere adioyning. The Poets haue fained a certaine Monster called Minotaurus, hauing in part the forme of a man, and in part the forme of a Bull; and they say that Pasiphae the Daughter of the sonne and wife of Minos King of creet fell in loue with a Bull, Of the mon∣ster mino∣taurus and by the helpe of Dedalus she was included in a woo∣den heifer couered with a cows hide, and so had copulation with the bul, and so came that monster minos included in a laborinth, and constraind the Athenians who had slain his son Androgeus to send euery year seauen young men, and 7. maides to be giuen to that mon∣ster to feede vppon, for hee woulde eate mannes flesh. At last Theseus sonne of Aegeus, king of Athens came into that laborinth, and slewe that Minotaure, and by the helpe of A∣riadne escaped out of the laborinth. Other relate the story in this manner; that when the Cretensians woulde haue expelled Minos from his kingdome, hee vowed that whatsoe∣uer likenesse firste appeared out of the sea for signe of victorie vnto him, he vowed sacri∣fice it to the goddes, if hee did enioy his regiment: and thereuppon a goodly Bull came vnto him out of the sea, wherewithall he was delighted: But after hee had recouered his kingdome in quiet, he kepte that Bull in his owne handes and sacrificed another, and that by this Bull was the Minotaure begotten on his wife Pasiphae. But the trueth is, that when Minos was in daunger to loose his kingdome, one Taurus, a valiant Prince and Captaine, came with a Nauie of good souldiours, and established him in quiet. Afterwarde falling in loue with Pasiphae king Minos wife, he lay with her in the house of Daedalus : which Dae∣dalus wrought with the Queen to giue him his pleasure, and that the Minotaure was a mon∣ster in Creete that had the face of an Oxe, and the other members like a man, such an one was seene in Aristotles time. Although other take it for a fiction; because the Romaines had it pictured in their ensignes of warre, vntill Caius Marius altered it to an Eagle, which remaineth to this day. Alciatus yeeldeth this reason why the Romans gaue such an armes, to signifie that secrecy becommeth a captain, and that proud and crafty counsels do hurt the authors of them. Limine quod caeco obscura & caligine monstrum, Depictum Romana phalaux in praelia gestat Nosque monent debere ducem secreta latere. Gnosiacis clausit Daedalus in latebris Semiuiroque nitent signa superba boue: Consilia authori cognita techna no ent. It is reported also, that when Cadmus went from Delphos to Phocis, an Oxe did directe him in the way and was his guide; which Oxe was bought out of the heards of Pelagon, ha∣uing in both his sides a white spot: it must needs be vnderstood of the moone, for Cadmus flying by night hauing the moone to shine vpon him (which is hyeroglyphically deciphe∣red by the Oxe,) gaue him light and direction to another city. It were endles to prosecute the seuerall speeches, prouerbs, allusions, emblems, playes, prizes, hyeroglyphicks, and deuises, made vpon Oxen; whereby, not onely men and women, cities, regions, and peo∣ple haue taken denomination from Oxen; but also some of the starres in the firmament: therefore I will not proceede to those deuises, but onely touche the sacrifices made with Oxen, and so conclude this story. It cannot be denied that the prime institution of sacrifices, was from, by, and for the or∣dinance of god, to teach the world to woorship him in bloud for sin, which coulde not be expiated but by the bloud of the onely immaculate son and lambe of god; and therefore I wil but remember how corruption polluted that ordinance, which was purely without idle cerimonies instituted by the euerlasting god; and yet was by mans inuention made wret∣ched, horrible, and damnable, through abuse of the fact that otherwise by diuine consti∣tution (as appeares in holy scripture) was heauenly, honourable, and blessed. To begin therefore with the originall of that heathenish and paganish sacrifice, instead of god the only true and deuine essence, to whom al sacrifice and deuine worship was due, and whose creatures both men, oxen, and all other liuing and visible things are, they offe∣red vnto all the hoasts of heauen, the sun, and stars, the heathen gods Iupiter, Mars, Miner∣ua, Pandrisus, and others: and if the sacrifice were costly and sumptuous, it was called Heca∣tombe. Now before their sacrifice they made praiers, burnd incense, for odors presented Prothymes (as they were termed) certaine preparations and cakes made of barley and salt, (called Vlochytae. ) After which, the prieste turned him sometimes to the right hand, and sometimes to the left, and then began to take the gristle haires growing on the Oxes fore∣head betwixt his horns, making a tast of them, and casting them in the fire to begin the sa∣crifice. Then did he giue into the hands of the people standing by, little pots of wine like∣wise, to taste for sacrifice, and then hee which killed the beaste drewe his knife, or axe, or cleauer, from the heade to the tayle of the beaste. Nowe in euery sacrifice they hadde burning torches, which were lawfull for none to carry but for men, and not women, then the priest commaunded to kill the sacrifice, which sometime they did by knocking him on the head if the beast were to be sacrificed to hell, and those that weere therein, for they sa∣crificed a barren Cowe, or a blacke Sheepe to those ghostes. But if the sacrifice were for heauen, and to the powers thereof, they lifted vp his heade and cut his throate: then put they vnder him their Sphagian vesselles to receiue his bloud, and when the beast was falne downe, they flayed off his skinne. Then did the Priest or Flamen deuide the intrals, that so he might m e his augurisme (the bowels being proued at the altar.) Hauing loked into the bowels, they took out of eue∣ry gutte, member and part, a first fruites, moulded them together in the meale of greene wheat corne, then was it giuen to the Priest, who put thereunto frankincense, herbe mary, and fire, and so burned them altogether, which was called a perfect hoste. But if they sacri∣ficed to the gods of the sea, then did they first of all waue the bowels of the beaste in the sea flouds before it was burned. The best sacrifices were fatted and white Oxen or Kine, such as had neuer been vnder yoake, for the beast vsed to labour was accounted vncleane: they neuer offered in sacrifice one vnder thirty dayes olde, nor ouer fiue yeares by the lawes of the Priests. When the Spartanes ouercame their enimies by stratagem, they sacrificed to Mars an oxe, but when by open force, they sacrificed a cocke, for they esteemed more of an vnbloudy then a bloudy victory. When a man sacrificed a Cowe to Minerua, he was bound to sacrifice a Sheepe and an Oxe to Pandrysus. When the Locrensians in a publike spectacle woulde make a sacrifice, they wanted an Oxe, for which cause they gathered together so many sticks of small woode, as made the image of an Oxe artificially conioyned togither, and so setting it on fire burned it for an offering: whereuppon a Locrensian Oxe, was an ironicall prouerbe for a sacrifice of no weight or merrite. It is also reported that an Heyfer being brought to the altar of Miner∣ua to be sacrificed did there Calue, wherefore the Priests would not meddle with her, but let her goe away free, because Minerua was the goddesse of procreation; holding it an im∣pious thing to kill that in sacrifice which had broughte foorth a young one at the altar: to conclude, as Vegetius saith, that on a time Iustice was so offended with men because they imbrewed euery altar with the bloud of Oxen and cattell, that therefore she lefte the earth, and retired back againe to dwell among the starres: so will we in this discourse cease from any further prosecution of the morrall or natural description of these beasts, leauing their lawfull vse to the necessity of mankinde, and their abusiue idolatrous sacrifices to him that loueth all his creatures, and will require at mans hand an account of the life and bloude of brute beastes. OF THE CALFE. The definiti∣on and name A Calfe, is a young or late enixed Bull or Cow, which is called in Ebrew Egel or Par: and sometimes Ben-bakar, the sonne of an Oxe. Yet Rabbi Salomon, and Abraham Esra, expound Egel, for a Calfe of one yeare old. The Sarazens of that word call a Calfe Hesel. The Grecians Moschos, whereof is deriued Moscharios, but at this day they call him Mouskari, or Moscha∣re. The Italians Vitello, the French Veau, the Spaniardes Ter∣nera of teneritudo, The etymo∣logy of Vitu∣lus. signifying tendernesse, and somtimes Be∣zeron and Vezerro, the Germanes Ein Kalb, the Flemmings Kalf, and the Latines Vitulus, of the old worde Vitulor, signi∣fying to be wanton, for Calues are exceedingly giuen to sport and wantonnes; or as other suppose, from the greeke worde Italous came Vitulus, and therefore the Latines doe not alway take Vitulus for a young or newe-foaled beaste, but sometime for a Cow, as Virgill Aeclog. Ego hanc vitulam (ne forte recuses.) Bis venit ad mulctram binos alit vbere fortus. Depono. And this word (like the Greeke Moschos ) signifieth male and female: whereunto by di∣uers authours both Greeke and Latine, are added diuers epithites by way of explication, both of the condition, inclination, and vse of this yong beast; calling it wilde, ripe for the temples, vnarmed, weake, sucklings, tender, wandring, vnhorned, and such like. The epithits of a Calfe. And be∣cause the Poets faine that Io was turned into a Cow, and that the violet hearb was assigned by Iupiter for her meate, they deriue viola, a violet, from Vitula a Calfe, by a kind of gre∣cian imitation. It is also certaine that the honour of this young beast hath giuen denomination to some men, as Pomponius Vitulus, and Vitulus Niger Turamius, Ʋarro. Men named after calues and Vitellius was deriued from this stemme or theame, although hee were an Emperour. The like may be saide of Moschos in Greeke, signifying a Calfe, for there was one Moschus a Sophiste that dranke nothing but water, and there was another Moschus a gramarian of Syr use, whome Athaeneus doeth re∣corde was a familiar of Aristarchus, and also of another, a poet of the Bucolickes ; and this serueth to shewe vs, that the loue our auncestours bare vnto cattell, appeered in taking vp∣pon them their names, and were not ashamed in those elder times, wherein wisdome and inuention was most pregnable, to glory in their heards from which they receiued main∣tenance. But to the purpose, that which is said of the seuerall parts of an Oxe and a Cowe, belongeth also to a Calfe; for their anatomy differeth not, because they are conceiued and generated by them, and in them: and also their birth and other such thinges concer∣ning that, must be inquired in the discourse of a Cow. A secret by the hoofe. It is reported by an obscure authour, that if the hoofe of a Calfe be not absolued or fi∣nished in the dammes belly before the time of caluing, it will dye. And also it must be ob∣serued, that the same diseases which doe infeste and harme an Oxe, do also befall Calfes, to their extreame perill: but they are to be cured by the same forenamed remedies. And aboue the residue, these young beasts are trobled with wormes, The diseases of a calfe which are ingendered by crudity, but their cure is to keepe them fasting till they haue well disgested their meate, and then take lupines halfe sod, and halfe rawe, beaten together, The cure of wormes and let the iuice thereof be powred downe his throate; otherwise, take dry figges and fitches beaten together with Santonica, called Lauender cotten, and so put it downe the Calues throate as aforesaid, To choose calu for stor or else the fatte of a Calfe and marrube with the iuice of leekes, will certainly kill these euels. It is the manner to regard what Calues you will keepe, and what you will make of and kill either for sacrifice as in ancient time, or priuate vse and to marke and name those that are to be reserued for breed and labour, according to these verses. Post partum carain vitulos traducitur omnis Et quos aut pecori malint submittere habendo. Continuoque notas & nomina gentis inurunt, Aut aris scruare sacris aut scindere terram Et campum horrente fractis inuertere glebis. And all these things are to be perfourmed immediatly after their weaning: and then in the next place you must regard to gelde the males, which is to be perfourmed in Iune, or as Magus saith in May, or at the farthest let them not be aboue a yeare olde, for else they will grow very deformed and small: but if you libbe them after two yeares olde, they will proue stubborne and intractable, wherefore it is better to gelde them while they be yong ones, which is to be perfourmed not with any knife or yron instrumente, The libbing of calues. because it will draw much bloud, and in danger the beast thorough paine, but rather with a clouen reed or sticke, pressing it together by litle and litle: but if it happen that one of a yeare or twoe yeares olde be to be libbed, then you must vse a sharpe knife, after you haue pressed the stones into the coddes, and cut them out at one stroake, and for stanching of the bloud, Aristotle sotion. varro let the cod, and the ends of the vaines be seared with an hot iron, and so the wound is cured as soone as it is made. And now the time for the effecting hereof, is best in the waine of the moone, either in the spring or autumne; but it is good to leaue as many of the vaines and nerues of the vi∣rile member vntouched and whole as may be, that so he may not loose any condition of a male, except the power of generation. And if the wound be ouermuch giuen to bleede, lay vpon it ashes with the spume of siluer, which is apt to stanch bloud in all green wounds; and that day let him not drinke and eate but a very little meate: Palla tus. souon. Coll mella for three daies after giue him greene tops or grasse, soft and easie to chewe, and at the third daies end, annoynt the wound with liquid pitch, ashes, and a little oyle, which will sooner cure the scar and keepe the flies from stinging or harming it. If at any time a cow cast her calfe, you may put vnto her another calfe, that hath not sucke ynough from his owne Damme; and they vse in some countries to giue their calues Wheate-branne, and barley-meale, and ten∣der meate, Ʋarro. especially regarding that they drinke morning and euening. Let them not lye together in the night with their Danime, but asunder, vntill their sucking time, and then immediately separate them againe, vnlesse the cow be well fed when the calfe suck∣eth, Food for Calues hir ordinary foode will yeald no great trybute of Milke; and for this cause, you must beginne to giue the calfe greene meate betimes. Afterward being weaned, you may suffer those young ones to feed with their Dams in the Autumne, which were calued in the spring. Then in the next place, you must regard the taming of the beast, being ready for labour, which is expressed in the former treatise of an Oxe. Sacrifices of Calues. The auncients called Victoria by the name of the Goddesse Vitula, bycause they sacri∣ficed vnto hir calues, which was termed a Vitulation: and this was vsuall for victory and plenty, as is to bee seene at large in Giraldus, Macrobius, Nonius, Ouid, and Virgill: but the heathens had this knowledge, that their Gods would not accept at their hands a lame calfe for a sacrifice, Pliny Coelius although it were broght to the altar, and if the taile of the calfe did not touch the ioyntes of his hinder legs, they did not receiue him for sacrifice. And it is said of Aemilius Paulus, when he was to goe against the Macedonians, hee sacrificed to the Moone in her declination eleuen calfes. Iosephus A wonder. It is very strange, that a calfe being ready to be sacrificed at the Temple of Ierusalem, brought forth a Lambe which was one fore∣shewing signe of Ierusalems destruction. But Aristole declareth, that in his time, there was a calfe that had the head of a child, Monsters of calues. and in Luceria a Towne of Heluetia, was there a calfe which in his hinder parts was a Hart. Nioivillagag When Charles the fifth went with his Armye into Affrique and ariued at Larghera a Noble citty of Sardinia, there happened an exceeding great wonder, for an Oxe rought forth a calfe with two heades, and the Woman that did owe the Oxe, presented the calfe to the Emperor, and since that time I haue seene the picture of a more strange beast cal∣ued at Bonna, in the Bishopricke of Colen, which had two heades, one of them in the side not bigger then a Hares head, and two bodies ioyned together; whereof the hinder partes were smooth and bald, but the taile blacke and hayrie: it had also seauen feete, whereof one had three hoofes, this Monster liued a little while, and was brought forth in An: 1552. the 16. day of May, to the wonder and admiration of all them, who either knew the truth, or had seene the picture. Butchers are wont to buy calues for to kill and sell their flesh, for in all creatures, the flesh of the young ones are much better then the elder, The flesh of calues because they are moyst and soft, and therefore wil digest and concocte more easie: and for this cause Kids, Lambes, and Calues, are not out of season in any time of the yeare; and are good from fifteene daies to two monthes old, being ornaments to the Tables of great Noble men, which caused Fiera to make this Distichon : Assiduos habeant vitulum tua prandia in vsus cui madida & sapida iuncta tepore caro est. And principally the Germanes vse the chawtherne, the head, and the feete, for the be∣ginning of their meales, and the other parts either roasted, or baked, and sometime sod in broath, and then buttered, spiced and sauced, and eaten with Onyons. Pliny. Of the medi¦cines. The Medicines arising from this beast, are the same that come from other his fires be∣fore spoken off, and especially the flesh of a calfe doeth keepe the flesh of a new wound, (if it be applyed thereunto) from swelling, and being sodden it is precious against the bi∣tings of a mans teeth: and when a mad Dogge hath bitten a man or a beast, they vse to pare the wound to the quicke, and hauing sodden veale mingled with the sewet and heele they lay some to the wound, Marcellus and make the patient drinke of the broath: and the same broath is Soueraigne against all the bitings of Serpentes. The hornes of a Calfe sodde soft, are good against all intoxicate poyson, and especially Hemlock. The poulder of a Calues thigh drunke in Womans Milke, cureth all filthy running vlcers, Pliny and out of the braine of a calfe they make an oyntment, to loosen the hardnesse of the belly. Nicander The mar∣row softneth all the ioyntes, driueth away the bunches arising in the body; hauing an operation to soften, fill, dry and heate. Take Oyle, Waxe, rust, and the marrow of a Calfe, against all bounches in the face: and calues marrow with an equll quantity of whay, Rasis. Oyle, Rose-cake and an Egge, do soften the hardnesse of the cheekes and eye-lids, Marcellus being laied to for a playster: and the same mixed with Cumin, and infused into the eares, hea∣leth the paines of them; and also easeth the vlcers in the mouth. The marrow with the sewet composed together, cureth all vlcers and corruptions in the secrets of Men and Women. The fat pounded with salt, cureth the louzye euill, Pliny. and likewise the vlcerous sores in the head. The same mixed with the fat of a Goose, Marcellus and the iuyce of Basill or wild Cumyn; and infused into the eares, helpeth deafenesse and paines thereof. The fat taken out of the thigh of a Calfe, and sod in three porringers of water and supped vp, is good for them that haue the flux: and the dung of a calfe fryed in a pan, layed to the buttocks and secrets, doth wonderfully cure the bloody flixe: Leonellus also lay∣ed to the raines, prouoketh vrine, and sod with rue, cureth all the inflamations in the seate of a man or woman. The sewet of a calfe with nitre aswageth the swelling of the cods, pliny. being applied to them like a plaister: and the sewet alone, doth cure the pieling of the Nayles. The liuer with sage leaues cut together, and pressed to a liquor, being drunke, easeth the paine in the small of the belly. The gall mingled with poulder of a Harts horne, and the seede of Marioram, cureth Leprosies and scurfes, and the gall alone annoynted vpon the head, driueth away nittes. The melt of a calfe is good for the melt of a man, and for vlcers in the mouth; and glew made of his stones, as thicke as hony, and annoynted vpon the le∣prous place, cureth the same, if it be suffered to dry thereupon. With the dung of calues they perfume the places which are hurt with Scorpions, and the ashes of this dunge with vineger, stayeth bleeding: Marcellus magnifieth it aboue measure, for the cure of the gout, to take the fime of a calfe which neuer eate grasse, mix∣ed with lees of vineger, and also for the deafenesse of the eares, (when there is paine with al) take the vrine of a Bul, Goate, or calfe, and one third part of vineger well sod together, with the herbe Fullonia, then put it into a flagon with a small mouth, and let the necke of the patient be perfumed therewith. Of the supposed Beast CACVS. T Here be some of the late writers, which take the cacus spoken of by Virgill in his eight book of Aeneids, to be a wilde Beast, which Virgill describeth in these words: Hic spelunca; fuit vaslo submota recessu: Solis inaccensam radijs semporque recenti Ora virum tristi pendebant pallida tabo. Ore vomens ignes magna se mole ferebat, nequeunt expleri corda tuendo Pectori semiferi atque extinctus faucibus ignes, Semihominis caci: facies quam dira tegebat caede tepebat humus foribusque affixa superbis: Huic monstro-vulcanus erat pater, &c. That is, cacus was halfe a beast and halfe a man, who had a caue in the earth against the Sunne, his Denne replenished with the heades of men, and hee himselfe breathing out fire, so that the earth was warmed with the slaughter of men slaine by him, whose slaughter he fastened vpon his owne doores, being supposed to be the sonne of Vulcan. And there be some that affirme this Cacus, to haue wasted and depopulated all Italy, and at length when Hercules had slaine Geryon, as he came out of Spaine thorough Italy with the Oxen which he had taken from Geryon, Cacus drew diuers of them into his Caue by their tailes: but when Hercules missed daily some of his Cattell, and knewe not which way they strayed, at last he came to the Denne of Cacus : and seeing all the steppes stand forward by reason the Cattell were drawne in backeward, he departed; and going away, he heard the loughing of the Oxen for their fellowes, whereby he discouered the fraud of Cacus : whereuppon he presently ranne and tooke his club, the monster being within his Caue, closed vp the mouth thereof with a wonderfull great stone, and so hid himselfe for feare: but Hercules went to the toppe of the Mountaine and there digging downe the same, vntill he opened the Caue, then leaped in suddenly and slew the Mon∣ster, and recouered his Oxen. But the truth is, this forged Cacus was a wicked seruant of Euander, which vsed great robbery in the Mountaines, and by reason of his euill life was called cacus, for Ca os in Greeke signifieth euill. He was said to breath forth fire because he burned vp their corne growing in the fields, and at last was betrayed of his owne sister; for which cause she was deified, and the Virgins of Vesta made Sacrifice to her: and therefore it shall be ydle to prosecute this fable any farther (as Albertus Magnus doth) it being like the fable of Alci∣da, which the Poets faine was a bird of the earth, and being inuincible burned vp al Phry∣gia, and at last was slaine by Minerua. OF THE CAMELL. A Lthough there be diuers sorts of Camels, according to the seuerall Countryes, yet is the name not much varied, but taken in the generall sence for the denomination of euery particular. Of the name The Haebrewes call it Gamal ; the Chaldaeans Gamela, and Gamele : The Arabians, Gemal: Gemel A egeb: Algiazar. The Persians, Schetor : the Saracens, Shymel ; the Turkes call a company of Camels trauailing together, Co∣rauana. The Italians and Spaniardes cal a Camell Camello, the French chameau, the Germanes Ramelthier, all deriued of the Latine Camelus, and the Greeke camelos. The Illyri∣ans, artemidorvs. The Etymo∣logie of the word. Horus call it Vuelblud : and the reason of the name camelos in Greeke is, because his burden or load is layed vpon him kneeling or lying, deriued (as it may seeme) of camptein Me∣rous, the bending of his knees and slownesse of pace; wherefore a man of a slow pace, was among the Egyptians deciphered by a camell. For that cause, there is a Towne in Si called Gangamela ; that is, the house of a camell, erected by Darius the Sonne of Histaspi , allowing a certaine prouision of food therein for wearied and tyred camels. The epithites giuen to this beast are not many among Authors, for he is tearmed by them rough, de∣formed, and thirsting; as Iuuenall. Deformis poterunt immania membra, camell: And Persius in his fifth Satyre saith; Tolle recens primus piper è sitiente camelo. There are of them diuers kindes, according to their countries wherein they breed: as in India, The kinds of Camels. in Arabia, and in Bactria: All those which are in India, are saide by Didimus to be bred in the Mountaines of the Bactrians, and haue two bunches on their backe, and one other on their breast, whereupon they leane: they haue somtimes a Bore for theyr fyre, which feedeth with the flocks of she-camels; for as Mules and Horsses will couple toge∣ther in copulation, so also will Bores and camels: and that a camell is so ingendred some∣times, The generati¦on of Bactri∣an Camels. the roughnes of his haire like a Boares or Swines, and the strength of his body, are sufficient euidences; and these are worthily called Bactrians, because they were first of all conceiued among them, hauing two bunches on their backes; whereas the Arabian hath but one. The colour of this camell, is for the most part browne, or puke? yet there are heards of white ones in India. The parts & colour of these camels. Ptolomeus Lagi brought two straunge thinges into Egypt, a blacke camell, and a man which was the one halfe white and the other halfe blacke in equall proportion, the which caused the Egyptians to wonder and maruaile at the shape and proportion of the camell, and to laugh at the man: whereupon it grew to a prouerbe, a Camell among the Egypti∣ans, The seuerall parts of a ca∣mell, Pliny for a matter fearefull at the first, and ridiculous at the last. The head and necke of this beast is different in proportion from all others, yet the E∣thyopians haue a beast called Nabim, which in his neck resembleth a Horse, and in his hed a Camell. They haue not teeth on both sides, although they want hornes (I meane both the Arabian and Bactrian Camell:) whereof Aristotle disputeth the reason; in the thirde Booke of the partes of creatures, and fourteenth chapter. Their necks are long and nim∣ble, whereby the whole body is much relieued; and in their necke toward the neather part of their throte, there is a place called Anhar, wherein a Camell dooth by speare or sword, most easily receiue his mortall or deadly wound. Siluaticus. His belly is variable, now great, now small like an Oxes; his gall is not distinguished within him like other beasts, but onely carried in great veynes, and therefore some haue thought he had none, and assigned that as a cause of his long life. Betwixt his thighes he hath two vdders, Aristotle Pliny. which haue foure speanes depending from them like a Cowes. His ge∣nital part is confected, and standeth vpon a sinnew, insomuch as there of may a stringe be made, for the bending of the strongest bow. The tayle is like the taile of an Asse, hangging down to their knees, they haue knees in euery leg, hauing in their former legs 3▪bones, & in the hinder foure. They haue an ancle like an Oxes, and very small buttockes, for the proportion of their great body: their foot is clouen, but so, that in the vnder part it hath but two Fissures or cleftes, opening the breadth of a finger, and in the vpper part foure Fissures or cleftes, opening a little, and hauing a little thing growing in them like as is in the foot of a Goose: The foot it selfe is fleshy like a Beares, and therefore they are shod with leather when they trauaile, least the gauling of their feet cause them to tyre. Auicenna affirmeth, that he had seene Camels with whole feet, like a Horsses, but their feet (although fleshy) are so tyed together with little lunges, that they neuer weare; and their manner of going or pace is like a Lyons, so walking, as the left foot neuer outgoeth the right, whereas all other beasts change the setting forward of their feet, and leane vp∣on their left feet while they remoue their right; but these alter step after step, so as the left foot behind, followeth the right before, and the hinder foote followeth the lefte before. Those Camels which are conceiued by Bores are the strongest, and fall not so quickly in to the myre as other, although his load be twice so heauy. Camels loue grasse (called Schoennanthi ) and especially Barley, which they eat vp won∣derfull greedily vntill all be in their stomach, The food of Camels and then will they chewe thereupon all the night long: so that the greatnesse of their belly to lodge their meat in before concoction is better then the benefite of their vpper teeth, because he can ruminate and chaw it so of∣ten as he pleaseth. There is a certaine herbe, which hath a seede like a mirtle seed, that is poyson to wormes, Siluaticus. and this seede is foode for Cammels; wherewith they grow fatte. It is therefore called Camell-thorne, and Astergar in the Aarabian toung. In the prouince of Aden both Sheepe, Oxen, Horses, and Camels, eate a kinde of fish, and them better be∣ing drie and stale, Paul. venet. Philostratus Calius. then new and fresh, by reason the immoderate heat in that region, bur∣neth vp all pasture and fruites: neither is there any beast which is so easily fed as a Camell. They will not drink of cleare or cleane water, but of muddy and slimie, and therefore they stamp in it with their feete. Their drinke must not be cleare. They will indure thirst for three or foure dayes together, but when they come to drink, they suck in aboue measure, recompensing their former thirst, and prouiding against that which is to come, and of all kinds the Bactrians are least trobled with thirst. They stale from one side to another, otherwise then any other beasts doe: this beast is very hot by nature, and therfore wanton and full of sport and wrath: braying most fearful∣ly when they are angred. They engender like Elephants and Tigers, that is; the female ly∣ing or sitting on the ground, which the male imbraceth like other males; and continue in copulation awhole day together. Their pro∣creation When they are to ingender, they goe vnto the secretst places they can finde, herein excelling in modesty the ancient Massagetes, who were not ashamed to lie with their wiues in the open field, and publique view of one another, wher as bruite beasts by instinct of nature, make the procreation of their kinde to be a most se∣cret-shamefull-honest action. At the time therefore of their lust, they are most vnruely and fierce, yeilding to none, no not to their owne keepers: the best time of their copulation is in September, for in Arabia, they begin to ingender in the third yeare of their age, and so within ten or eleuen moneths after she is deliuered of young, being neuer aboue one at a time for twins come not in her greate belly; so she goeth a yeare before she conceiue againe, although her young be seperated or weaned, before which time they doe not commonly. Caelius. Auicen. Vnto their former modesty for their copulation, we may adde another deuine instinct, and most true obseruation about the same, for the male will neuer couer his mother, or his sister: wher¦fore it is sincerely reported, that when a certaine Camel-keeper [desirous to trie this se∣cret] hauing the male, sonne to a female which he also kepte, he so couered the female-mother-Camell in all parts of her body except her secrets, that nothing coulde be seene of her, and so brought her lustfull son to couer her; which according to his present rage he perfourmed. As soone as he had done it, his maister and owner pulled away the maske or disguise from the damme, in the presence of the sonne, whereby he instantly perceiued his keepers fraud, in making him vnnaturally to haue copulation with his owne mother. In reuenge whereof he ranne vppon him, and taking him in his mouth, lift him vp into the ayre, presently letting him fall with noise and cry vnderneath his murdring and man∣quelling feete; where, with vnappeasable wrath and bloud desiring lyuor, he pressed and trode to pieces the incest marriage-causer, twixt him and his dearest mother; and yet not herewith satisfied, like some reasonable creature, depriued of heauenly grace, and caried with deadly reuenge against such vncleannes, being perswaded that the gilt of such an of∣fence could neuer receiue sufficient expiation by the death of the first deuiser, except the beguiled party sufferd also som smart of penalty; adiudged himselfe to death, and no lon∣ger worthy to liue by natures benifite, which had so violated the wombe that first concei∣ued him; and therfore running to and fro, as it were to finde out a hangman for himselfe, at last found a sleepy rocke, from whence he leaped downe to end his life; and although he could not preuent his offence, yet he thought it best to cleanse away his mothers adul∣tery with the sacrifice of that bloud which was first conceiued in that wombe wherein hee had defiled. These camels are kept in heards and are as swift as horses, according to the measure of their strength, not onely because of their nimblenesse, but also because their strides and reach doth gather in more ground: for which cause they are vsed by the Indians for race, The pace & agility of ca∣mels when they goe to fetch the golde which is said to be kept by the Formicae Lions, which are not much bigger then Foxes: Herodotus. yet many times doe these Lions ouertake the camels in course and teare the riders in pieces They haue bene also vsed for battell or warre [by the Arabians in the Persian warre:] but their feare is so greate of an Horse, that (as Xenophon saith) in the institution of cyrus, when the armies came to ioyne, neither the camel would aproach to the Horse, or the horse to the camell; whereupon it is accounted a base and vnprofitable thing for a man to nourish camels for fight, yet the Persians for the fighte of Cyrus in Lidia, euer nourished camels and horses together, to take away their feare one from another. Of the labor and employ∣ment of Ca∣mels. Therfore they are vsed for carriage which they will perfourme with greate facility, being taughte by their keepers to kneell and lie downe to take vp their burthens, which by reason of their height a man cannot lay on them; alwaies prouided, that he will neuer goe beyond his ordinary lodging and baiting place, or endure more then his vsuall burthen; and it hath beene seen that one of these Bactrian camels, hath carried aboue ten Minars of corne, and aboue that a bed with fiue men therein. Pliny. They will trauell in a day a∣boue forty ordinary miles, for as Pliny saieth, that there was from Thomna to Gaza sixty and two lodging places for camels, which was in length one thousand, fiue hundred, thir∣ty and seauen miles. They are also vsed for the plough in Numidia, and for this cause are yoaked sometimes with horses, but Heliogabalus like as the Tartarians, Diodorus yoaked them together not onely for priuate spectacles and playes, but also for drawing of waggons and chariots. When they desire to haue them free and strong for any labor in the field, or war, they vse to geld both the male and the female, the manner whereof is in this sorte. The male by taking away his stones, and the female by searing her priuie parts within the brimme and laps thereof with a hotte yron, which being so taken away, they can neuer more ioyne in copulation, and these are more patient in labor and thirst, and likewise better endure the extreamitie of sand in those parts, Pliny. hauing this skill that if the mists of raine or sand, do neuer so much obscure the way from the rider, yet doeth shee remember the same without all stagge∣ring.

The flesh of a camell not to be eaten. Diodorus Leo Affric : It is forbidden in holy Scripture to eate a Camell, for although it chew the cud, yet is not the hoofe altogether clouen: and besides, the flesh thereof is harde of disgestion, and the iuyce thereof verye naught, heating the body aboue measure; yet many times haue men of base condition and minds eaten thereof, as in Arabia, and in the kingdome of Fezzen : & Athaeneus affirmeth, hat the king of Persia was wont to haue a whole Camel rosted for his owne table at his royall feastings: and Heliogabalus likewise caused to bee prepared for himselfe the heeles of Camels, and the spurs of cockes and Hennes, pulled off aliue, Lampridius. and whole Ost iches and Camels; saying, (though falsely) that God commaun∣ded the Iewes to eat them. Camels milke is wholesome for meat, because it is thinnest of all other, and because thereof it breedeth fewer obstructions, and is good for softening of the belly: for the naturall disposition of this beast, it is partly already related, whereby the singular vse thereof may be collected: yet there are certaine prouerbes and stories thereof, farther express ing their qualities. A historie of their naturall dis∣po ion. Caelius It is disdaine ull, and a discontented creature: whereupon it is fained of the Poets, that they besought Iupiter to giue them Hornes, with which petition he was so offended, that he tooke from them their eares, and ther ore in that, those are reproued, which are so far in loue with other things they want, that they deserue to loose the things they haue. Like∣wise the wantonnes thereof appeareth by the prouerbe of a dauncing Camell, when one take h vpon him more then his skill will serue to discharge: yet hath not this Beast beene free from ignominy, for when the Emperor Iustinian had founde the Treason of Arsaces the Armenian, Caelius. he caused him to ride thorough the citty vpon a Camell, to be shamed for his offence, Solinus. although in former times it was a kind of triumph and honor to be caried vp∣on a Camell, lead thorough a citty. In the lake of Asphaltites wherein all things sinke that come in it, many Camels and Buls swim thorough without daunger.

These Beasts are hated of Horsses and Lyons, for when Xerxes trauaild ouer the riuer Chidorus, through Paeonia and Crestonia, in the night time the Lyons descended into the campe and touched no creatures therein, except the camels, whome they destroyed for the most part. A camell will liue in the soile wherein he is bred fifty or an hundred yeares, and if hee be translated into any other Nation he falleth into madnesse, or scabs, or the gowt, and then they liue not aboue thirty yeares. There is a kind of grasse that groweth by the high waies in the countrey of Babylon, that killeth Camels when they tast thereof. The medi∣cines in the bodies o ca∣mels. Ponzet us Card alis Auicen . There are also medicinall properties in camels, for by reason hee is of a hotte and dry temperament, if a man infected with poyson be put into the warme belly of a camell new∣ly slaine, it looseneth the power of the poyson, and giueth strength to the naturall parts of the body. The fat taken out of the bunch and perfumed, cureth the Hemmorhoids, and the blood of a camell fryed, is pretious against the bloody flix or any other loose∣nes of the belly, the braine dryed and drunke with Vineger, helpeth the falling euill. The gall drunke with Hony, helpeth the Quinzy: and if it be laide to the eye-browes and fore∣head, sod in three cups of the best hony, it cureth the dimnes of the eyes, and auoydeth the flesh that groweth in them: and if the haires of a Camels taile be wounde together like a string, and tyed to the left arme ( Pliny affirmeth) they will deliuer one from a quar∣tan Ague. Marcellus The milke of camels newly deliuered of young, helpeth obstructions, and all shortnes of breath, and is also good against the Dropsie and hardnes of the melt. Also when one hath drunke poyson, this is a good. Antidote and amendeth the temper of the body. The fime of Camels dryed to dust with oyle, will cr spe or curle the haire, and stay bleeding at the nose, and the same hot, is good against the Gout. The vrine is most profitable for running sores, there haue bene which haue preserued it fiue yeares together and vsed it against hardnes of the belly, washing also therewith sore heads, and it helpeth one to the sence of smelling, if it be held to the nose, likewise against the Dropsie, the Spleane, and the Ring-worme. Of the Camell DROMEDARIE. A Camell is called of the Graecians Dromos, by reason of the swiftnes of his race, and also an Arabian camell, which hath al things common with the former Bactrian camell, except, The descrip∣tion of a D o¦medary, and the Etymolo¦gie of his name, first in the shape, for she hath but one bunch on the back, and ma∣ny Nations, as the Italians, French, Germans, and Spaniards, vse the word Dromedary, onely without addition; The Graeci∣ans neuer name it without the addition of a camel. Therefore this is a kinde of camell of lesse stature, but much swifter; for which cause, it is deriued from running. Didymus. Isidorus. A It cheweth the cud like a Sheepe, and the other camell: History. the French king had sent him from the great Turke two of these, white coloured, and I my selfe haue seene one of them, being fifteene cubits high, wanting some nine inches, and about six cubits in length, hauing the vpper lip clouen in the middle like a Hare, and two broad nailes on his feet, which in the vpper part appeared clouen, but vnderneath they were whole and fle∣shy without diuision, and round in proportion like a pewter dish: It hath also a harde bunch on his brest, whereon it leaned, sitting down and rising: and also vpon either knee one: these are saide to liue fifty yeares, but the Bactrians an hundred: Aelianus. they were vsed for drawing of Charriots, and great presents for Princes, and when they goe to warre euery one carrieth two Archers, which fit vpon him, backe to backe, shooting forth their darts, one against the front of the enimy, Diodorus and the other against the prosecutours and follo∣wers. They are able to go an hundred miles in a day, bearing a burthen of 15. hundred waight, yea sometimes two thousand, bending vpon his knee to take vp his load and rider, which receiued, he riseth vp againe with great patience, being obedient and ruleable, yet kick∣ing when his angry, which is very seldome; and therefore Terence did significantly de∣scribe a good seruant by the name of Dromo, deriued from Dromas a runner: and for the conclusion of the History of these two sortes of camels, I will heere adde the relation and memorable obseruations of Iohannes Leo Afer, in his ninth booke of the description of Affricke, in his owne words following. A Camell is a gentle and pleasaunt-tame beast, whereof there are plenty in Affrica, A relation of Ioh. Leo A∣fer, out of his ninth Booke of the descrip¦tion of Af∣fricke. especially in the desertes of Lybia, Numidia, and Barbarie : by which the Affricans estimate their owne wealth, for when they contende who is the richest Prince or Noble man amonge them, they say he was worth or hath so many thousande Ca∣mels, and not so many thousand crownes. And he that hath Camels, liueth amonge them like a Gentleman, because hee can at his pleasure traiuaile into the desertes, and fetch Marchandize from farre, which the greatest prince or Nobleman cannot without them, by reason of the drought of those places. And of these kinde of creatures, there are to bee seene in all partes of the worlde, both in Asia, Affricke, and Europe, for the Tartarians, Cordians, Dalemians, and Turconians vse them in Asia, and the Turkish prin∣ces conuey all their carriages vpon them in Europe: Likewise doe all the Arabians in Af∣fricke. But it must be obserued, that the Affrican Camels, are much more woorth then the Asian, for they can endure trauaile for fortye and fifty daies togither, with very little or no meat, except sometimes in the euening when they are vnloaded, they go to the hed∣ges, thornes, and other greene places, and there eat any small thing they meet withall, as leaues and such like, wherewith they remaine satisfied, whereas the Asians can performe no such iourney, except they be kept fat and well fed: and it hath beene proued by good experience, that one of the Affricans hath trauailed fifty daies without meat, first wearing away the fat in their bunchy backe, then about their skinne and breast, and lastly about their ribbes, neuer giuing ouer till it was not able to beare one hundred waight. But the Asians, must alway carry prouender to sustaine their beastes, neuer trauailing but they haue one camell loaden with meat, for the other loaden with carriage, and so in∣dure a double charge: and when the Affricans go to any Martes or fayres being to returne emptie and vnloaded, they take no thought for their Camels food. Of these camels there be three kindes, one of them called Hugiun, (being broad and tall) and therefore apt to beare packes and burthens, but not before they be foure yeare olde, and after their ordi∣nary loade, is one thousand waight of Italian measure, being taught by the ierking of a small rod, on the brest and knees, to lie downe for their burthens and afterward to rise vp againe. And the Affricans do vse to geld their camels, reseruing but one male for the co∣uering of ten females. Another kind of their camels they cal Bechetos, such as haue two bunches, one for bur∣then, and the other for a man to ride vppon: and the third sort are called Ragnahil, which are of lower stature and leaner bodies then the residue, vnfit for burthen, and therefore are vsed for the saddle, by all the Noble men of Numidia, Arabia, and Libia : being able to runne an hundred miles a day, and performing long iourneyes with little or no prouen∣der: for the King of Tombuto being to send to Dara, or Selmessa, (which is distant from his court, nine hundred miles) his messenger performeth it vpon one of these Ragnahils, within the space of eight dayes. In the beginning of the springe they are most frolicke and vnruely, because then they incline to generation: at which time, they rage and fall vpon many that come vnto them, and especially those from whome they haue receiued blowes, remembring at that time, and requiting their former iniuries, vppon such as wronged them, whome if they can take in ther mouth, they lift them vp into the ayre, and then cast them downe againe vn∣der their feet, and tread vpon them, in which distemperd venerous fury, they remain for∣ty daies. They can easily endure thirst, fiue, nine, or fifteene daies, in necessity; neither wil their keeper giue them drinke at three daies thirst, for feare to harme them. As these camels are plesant & profitable, so also they seem to participate with the nature of mā; for they being wearied, no spur or stroke can make them hasten to their iourneyes end, therfore in Ethy∣opia and Barbary, they sing certaine songs behind the Beast, which so reuiue their decai∣ed sprits, that they set forward so fast, forgetting their tyred lims, to their iourneyes end, that their keepers can hardly follow. I haue also seene in Alcair, a camell, that could dance at the sound of a Timbrell, being thereunto taught when he was young by this meanes; first he was brought into a roome like a stable, the pauement wherof was made hot by a fire vnderdeath it, and without doors stood a musitian playing on his timbrell, the camell not for loue of the musick, but for the heat vnder his feete, lifted vp first one foot, and then another, as they doe which daunce, and so the heat increasing, he likewise did lift vp faster, whereunto he was accustomed for the space of ten moneths, at euery time one houre and a halfe, during which time the tim∣brell still sounded; so that at last, vse framed nature to such a straine, that he hearing a tim∣brell, he instantly remembred the fire that was wont to punish his feet, and so presently would leap to and fro like a dancer in publick spectacle, to the admiration of all beholders.

Heliodorus. his eies rowling and frowing, his mouth but small like a Harts, his toung is nere three foot long, and with that he will so speedily gather in his meate, that the eies of a man will faile to behold his hast, and his necke diuersly coloured, is fifteene foote long, which he holdeth vp higher then a Camels, and far aboue the proportion of his other parts. His forfeete are much longer then his hinder, and therefore his backe declineth towards his buttocks, theyr man∣ner of going. which are very like an asses. The pace of this beast differeth from all other in the world, for he doth not moue his right and left foote one after another, but both together, and so likewise the other, whereby his whole body is remoued at euery step or straine. These beastes are plentifull in Ethiopia, India, and the Georgian region, which was once called Media. Likewise in the prouince of Abasia in India, it is called Surnosa, The coun∣tris breeding these beasts. and in Abasia Surnappa, and the latter picture here set down, was truely taken by Melchior Luo∣rigus at Constantinople, in the yeare of saluation 1559. By the sight of one of these, sent to the great Turke for a present: which picture and discription, was afterwarde sent into Germany, and was imprinted at Norimberge. It is a solitary beaste and keepeth altoge∣ther in woodes, if it be not taken when it is young: Their natu∣rall dispositi∣on and mild∣nesse. they are very tractable and easie to be handled, so that a childe may leade them with a small line or cord about their heade, and when any come to see them, they willingly and of their owne accorde, turne themselues round as it were of purpose to shewe their soft haires, and beautifull coulour, being as it were proud to rauish the eies of the beholders. The skinne is of great price and estimation among merchants and princes, and it is said that vnderneth his belly, the coulourable spots are wrought in fashion of a fishers net, The skinne. and the whole bodie so admirably intercouloured with variety, that it is in vaine for the witte or art of man, once to go about or endeauour the aemulous imitation thereof. The taile of this beaste is like the taile of an Asse, and I cannot iudge that it is either swifte for pace, or strong for labour, and therefore well tearmed a wilde Sheepe, because the flesh hereof is good for meat, and was allowed to the Iewes by God himselfe for a cleane beast. OF THE ALLOCAMELVS. S Caliger affirmeth, that in the land of the Giants, ther is a beast which hath the heade, necke, and eares, of a Mule, but the body of a Ca∣mell; wherefore it is probable, that it is conceiued by a Camell and a Mule: the picture whereof is before sette downe, as it was taken from the sight of the beast, and imprinted with a discription at Mid∣dleborough in the yeare 1558. which was neuer before seen in Ger∣many, nor yet spoken by the Pliny. They said that it was an Indian Sheepe, out of the region of Peru, and so was brought to Antwerpe, sixe thousand miles distant from that nation. It was a∣bout two yardes high, and fiue foote in length, the neck was as white as any Swan: the co∣lour of his other parts was yellowish, and his feet like an Ostrige-Camels: and although it were a male, yet it did render his vrine backward: it was afterwarde giuen to the Empe∣rour by Theodoric Neus, a citizen of the nether Colen. It was a most gentle and meek beast like the Camelopardall, not past foure yeare olde: wherefore I thought good to expresse it in this place, because of the similitude it hath with the manners of the fourmer beaste, al¦though it want hornes and differ in some other members. Of another Beast called Campe. D Iodorus Siculus maketh relation, that when Dionisius with his Army trauailed thorough the desert and dry places, annoyed with diuers wild beasts, he came to Zambirra a citty of Lybia, where he slewe a beast bred in those partes called Campe, which had before that time destroyed many men, which action did pur∣chase him among the inhabitantes a neuer dying fame, and that therefore there might re∣maine a continuall remembrance to all posterity of that fact, he raised vp there a monu∣ment of the slaine beast to stand for euermore. OF THE CAT. Of the name A Cat is a familiar and well knowne beast, called of the Hae∣brewes Catull, and Schanar, and Schunara ; of the Graecians Aeluros, and Kattes, and Katis, of the Saracens, Katt, the Italians Gatta, and Gotto. The Spaniards, Gata and Gato, the French, Chat ; the Germanes, Katz ; the Illyrians, Kozka ; and Furioz, (which is vsed for a Cat by Albertus Magnus ) and I coniecture, to be either the Persian, or the Arabian worde. The Latines call it Feles, and sometimes Murile∣gus, and Musio, because it catcheth Myse, but most com∣monly Catus, which is deriued of Cautus, signifying wary: Ouid saith, The nature and etymolo¦gy of a Cat. that when the Gyantes warred with the Goddes, the Goddes put vpon them the shapes of Beasts, and the sister of Apollo lay for a spy in the likenes of a cat, for a cat is a watchfull and warye beast, sildome ouertaken, and most attendaunt to her sport and prey; according to that obseruation of Mantuan : Non secus ae muricatus, ille, inuadere pernam, Nititur, hic rimas oculis obseruat acutis. And for this cause did the Egyptians place them for hallowed Beasts, Their vse a∣mong the E∣gyptians and kept them in their Temples, although they alledged the vse of their skinnes for the couer of shieldes, which was but an vnreasonable shift, for the softnesse of a cats skinne is not fit to defend or beare a blow: It is knowne also, that it was capitall among them, to kill an Ibis, an Aspe, a Crocodill, A historie. a Dogge, or a Cat: insomuch as, that in the daies of King Ptolaemey, when a peace was lately made betwixt the Romaines and the Egyptians; and the Roman Ambas∣sadors remaining still in Egypt, Coelius it fortuned that a Romane vnwares killed a cat, which be∣ing by the multitude of the Egyptians espied, they presently fell vpon the Ambassadors house, to raze downe the same, except the offender might be deliuered vnto them, to suffer death: so that neither the honour of the Roman name, nor the necessity of peace, coulde haue restrained them from that fury, had not the King himselfe & his greatest Lords come in person, not so much to deliuer the Roman Cat-murderer, as to sauegard him from the peoples vio¦lence; and not onely the Egyptians were fooles in this kind, but the Arabi∣ans also, who worshipped a cat for a God; and when the cat dyed, they mour∣ned as much for her, as for the father of the fami¦ly, shauing the hair from their eye-lids, and carry∣ing the beast to the Tem∣ple, where the Priests sal∣ted it and gaue it a holy funerall in Bubastum : (which was a burying plas for cattes neer the Altar) wherin may appeare to al men, in what miserable blindnesse the wisest men of the world, (forsaking, or depriued of the true knowledge of God are,) more then captiuated, so that their wretched estate cannot better bee expres∣sed then by the words of S. Paule, When they thoght to be wise, they becam fools. Once cattes were all wilde, but afterward they retyred to houses, Of the tame∣ing of Cattes and their countreys. wherefore there are plenty of them in all countries: Martiall in an Epigram, celebrated a Pannonian cat with this distichon: Pannonicas nobis nunquam dedit vmbria cattas, Mauult haec dominae mittere dona pudens. The Spanish blacke cats are of most price among the Germaines, because they are nim∣blest, and haue the softest haire fit for garment. The best cats A cat is in all partes like a Lyonesse, (except in her sharpe eares) wherefore the Poets faine, that when Venus had turned a cat into a beautifull woman (calling her Aeluros ) who forgetting her good turne, contended with the goddesse for beauty: in indignation wher∣of, she rerurned her to her first nature, onely making her outward shape to resemble a ly∣on, which is not altogither idle, but may admonish the wisest, that faire & foule, men and beasts, hold nothing by their owne worth and benefit, but by the vertue of their creator: Wherefore if at any time they rise against their maker, let them looke to loose their ho∣nour and dignity in their best part, and to returne to basenes and inglorious contempt, out of which they were first taken, and howsoeuer their outwarde shape and condition please them, yet at the best they are but beasts that perish, for the Lyons suffer hunger. Cats are of diuers colours, but for the most part gryseld, like to congealed yse, which commeth from the condition of her meate: her head is like vnto the head of a Lyon, Sipontinus except in her sharpe eares: Of the seue∣ral parts. her flesh is soft and smooth: her eies glister aboue measure, especialy when a mā commeth to see a cat on the sudden, and in the night, they can hardly be endured, for their flaming aspect. Wherfore Democritus describing the persian smaradge saith that it is not transparent, but filleth the eie with pleasāt brightnes, such as is in the eies of Panthers and cats, for they cast forth beames in the shaddow and darkenes, but in the sunshine they haue no such clearnes, and thereof Alexander Aphrodise giueth this reason, both for the sight of Cattes and of Battes, that they haue by nature a most sharpe spirit of seeing. Albertus compareth their eye-sight to carbuncles in darke places, because in the night, they can see perfectly to kill Rattes and Myce: the root of the herbe Valerian (commonly called Phu ) is very like to the eye of a Cat, and wheresouer it groweth, if cats come ther∣vnto, they instantly dig it vp, for the loue thereof, as I my selfe haue seene in mine owne Garden, and not once onely, but often, euen then when as I had caused it to bee hedged or compassed round about with thornes, for it smelleth marueilous like to a cat. The Egyptians haue obserued in the eies of a cat, the encrease of the Moone-light, for with the Moone they shine more fully at the ful, and more dimly in the change and wain, and the male cat-doth also vary his eyes with the Sunne; for when the sunne ariseth, the apple of his eie is long; Gillius. toward noone it is round, and at the euening it cannot be seene at all, but the whole eie sheweth alike. The tongue of a cat is very attractiue, and forcible like a file, attenuating by licking the flesh of a man, Pliny. for which cause, when she is come neere to the blood, so that her own spit∣tle be mingled therewith, she falleth mad. Her teeth are like a saw, and if the long haires growing about her mouth (which some call Granons ) be cut away, she looseth hir corage. Her nailes sheathed like the nailes of a Lyon, striking with her forefeete, both Dogs and other things, The game & food of cats. as a man doth with his hand. This beast is woonderfull nimble, setting vpon her prey like a Lyon, by leaping: and therefore she hunteth both rats, all kind of Myce, & Birds, eating not onely them, but al∣so fish, wherewithall she is best pleased. Hauing taken a Mouse, she first playeth with it, and then deuoreth it, but her watchfull eye is most strange, to see with what pace and soft steps, she taketh birds and flies; and her nature is to hide her own dung or excrements, for she knoweth that the fauour and presence thereof, will driue away her sport, the little Mouse being able by that stoole, Pliny. A secret. to smell the presence of hir mortall foe. To keepe Cats from hunting of Hens, they vse to tie a litle wild rew vnder their wings, and so likewise from Doue-coates, if they set it in the windowes, they dare not approach vnto it for some secret in nature. Some haue said that cats will fight with Serpentes, and Toads, Of their loue and hatred and kill them, and perceiuing that she is hurt by them; she presently drinketh wa∣ter and is cured: but I cannot consent vnto this opinion: it being rather true of the Wea∣sell as shalbe afterward declared. Ponzettus sheweth by experience that cats and Serpents loue one another, for there was (sayth he) in a certain Monastery, a Cat norished by the Monkes, and suddenly the most parts of the Monkes which vsed to play with the Cat fell sicke: whereof the Physitians could find no cause, but some secret poyson, and al of them were assured that they neuer tasted any: at the last a poore laboring man came vnto them, affirming that he saw the Abbey-cat playing with a Serpent, which the Physitians vnder∣standing, presently conceiued that the Serpent had emptied some of her poyson vppon the cat, which brought the same to the Monkes, and they by stroking and handeling the cat, were infected therewith; and whereas there remained one difficulty, namely, how it came to passe, the cat her selfe was not poisoned thereby, it was resolued, that forasmuch as the Serpentes poison came from him but in playe and sporte, and not in malice and wrath, that therefore the venom thereof being lost in play, neither harmed the Cat at al, nor much endaungered the Monkes: and the very like is obserued of myce that will play with Serpents. Aelianus. Cats will also hunt Apes, and follow them to the woods, for in Egypt certaine Cattes set vpon an Ape, who presently tooke himselfe to his heeles and climed vp into a tree, af∣ter when the cattes followed with the same celerity and agility: (for they can fasten their clawes to the barke, and runne vp very speedily:) the Ape seeing himselfe ouermatched with number of his aduersaries, leaped from branch to braunch, and at last tooke hold of the top of a bough, whereupon he did hang so ingeniously, that the Cats durst not ap∣proch vnto him for feare of falling, and so departed. The nature of this Beast is, to loue the place of her breeding, The loue of home. neither will she tarry in any strange place, although carried very farre, being neuer willing to forsake the house, for the loue of any man, and most contrary to the nature of a Dogge, who will trauaile a∣broad with his maister; and although their maisters forsake their houses, yet will not these Beastes beare them company, and being carried forth in close baskets or sackes, they will yet returne againe or loose themselues. A Cat is much delighted to play with hir image in a glasse, and if at any time she behold it in water, presently she leapeth down into the water which naturally she doth abhorre, but if she be not quickly pulled forth and dryed she dieth thereof, because she is impatient of alw e. Those which will keepe their Cattes within doores, and from hunting Birds abroad, must cut off their eares, Albertus. A way to make Cats keepe home. for they cannot endure to haue drops of raine distil into them and therfore keep themselues in harbor. Nothing is more contrary to the nature of a Cat, then is wet and water, and for this cause came the Prouerbe that they loue not to wet their feet. It is a neate and cleane∣ly creature, oftentimes licking hir own body to keepe it smooth and faire, hauing natu∣rally a flexible backe for this purpose, and washing hir face with her fore feet: A coniectu∣rall secret. but some obserue, that if she put her feete beyond the crowne of her head, that it is a presage of raine, and if the backe of a cat be thinne the beast is of no courage or value. They loue fire and warme places, whereby it falleth out that they often burne their coates. Their copu∣lation. They de∣sire to lie soft, and in the time of their lust (commonly called cat-wralling) they are wilde and fierce, especially the males, whoe at that time (except they be gelded) will not keepe the house: at which time they haue a peculiar direfull voyce. The maner of their copula∣tion is this, the Female lyeth downe and the Male standeth, and their females are aboue measure desirous of procreation, for which cause they prouoke the male, and if he yeeld not to their lust they beate and claw him, but it is onely for loue of young and not for lust: Aristotle the meale is most libidinous, and therefore seeing the female will neuer more engender with him, during the time hir young ones sucke, hee killeth and eateth them if he meet with them, (to prouoke the female to copulation with him againe, Aelianus. for when she is depri∣ued of her young, she seeketh out the male of her own accord,) for which the female most warily keepeth them from his sight. During the time of copulation, the female continu∣ally cryeth, whereof the Writers giue a double cause; one, because she is pinched with the talants or clawes of the male in the time of his lustfull rage, and thother, because his seed is so fiery whot, that it almost burneth the females place of conception. When they haue litered or as we commonly say kittened, they rage against Dogges, and will suffer none to come neere their young ones. The best to keep are such as are littered in March, Choyse of young Cats. they go with young fifty daies, and the females liue not aboue sixe or seuen yeares, the males liue longer especially if they be gelt or libbed: the reason of their short life is their rauening of meate which corrupteth within them. They cannot abide the sauour of oyntments but fall madde thereby; Gillius Caelius alu. Mundell Their dis∣eases. they are some∣times infected with the falling euill, but are cured with Gobium. It is needelesse to spend any time about her louing nature to man, how she flattereth by rubbing her skinne a∣gainst ones Legges, how she whurleth with her voyce, hauing as many tunes as turnes, for she hath one voice to beg and to complain, another to testifie her delight & pleasure, another among hir own kind by flattring, by hissing, by puffing, by spitting, insomuch as some haue thought that they haue a peculiar intelligible language among themselues. Therefore how she beggeth, playeth, leapeth, looketh, catcheth, tosseth with her foote, riseth vp to strings held ouer her head, sometime creeping, sometimes lying on the back, playing with one foot, somtime on the bely, snatching, now with mouth, & anon with foot, aprehending greedily any thing saue the hand of a man with diuers such gestical actions, it is needelesse to stand vpon; insomuch as Coelius was wont to say, The hurt that commeth by the familiari∣ty of a cat. that being free from his Studies and more vrgent waighty affaires, he was not ashamed to play and sport him∣selfe with his Cat, and verily it may well be called an idle mans pastime. As this beast hath beene familiarly nourished of many, so haue they payed deare for their loue, being requiret with the losse of their health, and sometime of their life for their friendship: and worthily, because they which loue any beasts in a high mesure, haue so much the lesse charity vnto man. Therefore it must be considered what harmes and perils come vnto men by this beast. It is most certaine that the breath and sauour of cats consume the radicall humour and destroy the lungs, Ahynzoar. and therefore they which keepe their cats with them in their beds haue the aire corrupted and fall into feuer hectickes and consumptions. Alex, benidict. There was a cer∣taine company off Monkes much giuen to nourish and play with Cattes, whereby they were so infected, that within a short space none of them were able either to say, reade, pray, or sing, in all the monastery; and therefore also they are dangerous in the time of pestilence, for they are not onely apt to bring home venomous infection, but to poy∣son a man with very looking vpon him; wherefore there is in some men a naturall dislike and abhorring of cats, their natures being so composed, that not onely when they see them, but being neere them and vnseene, and hid of purpose, they fall into passions, fret∣ting, sweating, pulling off their hats, and trembling fearefully, as I haue knowne many in Germany, the reason whereof is, because the constellation which threatneth their bo∣dies which is peculiar to euery man, worketh by the presence and offence of these crea∣tures: and therefore they haue cryed out to take away the Cats. The like may be sayd of the flesh of cats, cats flesh which can sildome be free from poyson, by reason of their daily foode eating Rats and Mice, Wrens and other birds which feede on poyson, and aboue all the braine of a cat is most venomous, for it being aboue measure dry, Ponzettus. Alexander. stoppeth the animall spirits, that they cannot passe into the ventricle, by reason whereof memory faileth, and the infected person falleth into a phrenzy. The cure wher∣of may he this, take of the Water of sweete Marioram with Terra lemnia the waite of a groate mingled together, and drinke it twice in a month, putting good store of spices in∣to all your meate to recreate the spirits withall, let him drinke pure Wine, wherein put the seede of Diamoschu. But a cat doth as much harme with her venemous teeth, there∣fore to cure her biting, they prescribe a good diet, sometime taking Hony, turpentine, and Oyle of Roses melt together and laied to the wound with Centory : sometime they wash the wound with the vrine of a man, and lay to it the braines of some other beast and pure wine mingled both together. Mathaeolus The haire also of a cat being eaten vnawares, stoppeth the artery and causeth suffocati∣on: and I haue heard that when a child hath gotten the haire of a cat into his mouth, it hath so clouen & stucke to the place that it could not be gotten off again, and hath in that place bred either the wens or the kings euill: to conclude this point it appeareth that this is a dangerous beast, & that therfore as for necessity we are constrained to nourish them for the suppressing of small vermine: so with a wary and discret eie we must auoyde their harmes, making more account of their vse then of their persons. In Spaine and Gallia Narbon, they eate cats, but first of al take away their head and taile, and hang the prepared flesh a night or two in the open cold aire, to exhale the sauour and poyson from it, finding the flesh thereof to be almost as sweete as a Cony. It must needes be an vncleane and impure beast that liueth onely vpon vermin and by rauening, for it is commonly said of a man when he neezeth, Perottus. that he hath eaten with Cats: likewise the familiars of Witches do most ordinarily appeare in the shape of cats, which is an ar∣gument that this beast is dangerous in soule & body. It is said that if bread be made wher∣in the dung of cats is mixed, it wil driue away Rats and Mice. But we conclude the story of this beast with the medicinal obseruations, and tary no longer in the breath of such a crea∣ture compounded of good and euil. It is reported that the flesh of cats salted & sweetned hath power in it to draw wens from the body, & being warmed to cure the Hemorrhoids and paines in the raines and backe, according to the verse of vrsinus : Et lumbus lumbis praestat adesus opem. Galenus. The medici∣nall vertues of a cat. Aylsius prescribeth a fat cat sod for the gout, first taking the fat, and annoynting there∣with the sicke part, and then wetting Wooll or Towe in the same, and binding it to the of∣fended place. For the paine and blindnesse in the eye, by reason of any skinnes, Webs, or nailes, this is an approued medicine. Take the head of a blacke Cat, which hath not a spot of another colour in it, and burne it to pouder in an earthen pot leaded or glazed with∣in, then take this poulder and through a quill blow it thrice a day into thy eie, and if in the night time any heate do thereby annoy thee, take two leaues of an Oke wet in cold water and binde them to the eye, and so shall all paine fly away, and blindnes depart al∣though it hath oppressed thee a whole yeare, and this medicine is approued by manye Physitians both elder and later. The liuer of a cat dryed and beate to poulder is good against the stone: Galen. the dung of a female cat with the claw of an Oule hanged about the necke of a man that hath had seuen fits of a quartane Ague, cureth the same: Sextus a neezing poulder made of the gall of a black cat, and the waight of a groate thereof taken and mingled with foure crownes waight of Zambach, helpeth the conuulsion and wrynesse of the mouth: Aetius. Rasis. Albertus Pliny. and if the gall of a Cat with the black dung of the same cat, be burned in perfume vnder a woman trauailing with a dead child, it will cause it presently to come forth: and Pliny saith that if a pin, or thorne, or fish bone, sticke in ones mouth, let him rub the outside against it with a little cats dung, and it will easily come forth. Giuen to a Woman suffering the fluxe, with a little Rozen and Oyle of Roses, it stayeth the humour; and for a Web in the eie of an horse euening and morning, blow in the poulder of cats dung, and it shall be cured. OF THE WILDE CAT. A Ll Cats at the beginning were Wilde, and therefore some doe interpret ijm. Esay. 34. for wilde cats; and the Germans call it Bonumruter, that is, a tree-rider, because she hunteth Birds and foules from tree to treee. The Spaniard calleth it Gato-montes, and in some places of France it is called chat-caretz. There are great store of them in Heluetia, especial∣ly in the Woods, and sometime neere the Waters, also being in colour like tame cats but blacker, such as in Eng∣lang is called a Poolcat. I saw one of them, which was taken in September, and obserued, that it was in length from the forehead to the toppe of the taile, foure full spannes, and a blacke line or strake all along the backe, and likewise some blacke vpon the Legges; betwixt the breast and the necke there was a large white spot, and the colour of her other parts was dusky, red, and yellow, especially about the buttocks, the heeles of her feet were blacke, her tayle longer then an ordinary house cats, hauing two or three blacke circles about it, but toward the top all blacke. They abound in Scandinauia, where the Linxes deuoure them: otherwise they are hun∣ted with Dogges, or shot with Gunnes, Olaus mag: and many times the countrey men seeing one in a tree, doth compasse it about with multitude, and when she leapeth downe kill hir with their clubs, according to the verse of Neuersianus: Felemque minacem Arboris in trunco, Longis perfigere telis. In the prouince of Malabar, these cattes liue vpon trees, because they are not swift to run, but leape with such agility, that some haue thought they did flye: and verily they do flie, for they haue a certaine skin, which when they lie in quiet, cleaueth or shrinketh vp to their bellies, but being stirred, the same spreadeth from their forefeet to their hinder, like the Wing of a Bat; by vertue whereof, they stay vp themselues in the aire, passing form tree to tree like a foule: as also doth the Pontique mouse, as shall be declared after∣ward. The skinnes of wild cats are vsed for garments, for there is no skinne warmer, as by experience appeareth in Scithia and Moscouia, where their women are clothed with the furre of cats, but especially for buskins and sleeues with their haire turned inward, not on∣ly against cold but for medecine, against contracted sinnewes, or the gout. The fat of this beast is reserued by some for heating, softening, and displaying tumours in the flesh: and whatsoeuer Rasis or any other said of the house Cat before in the medicinall partes, that also appertaineth to this, except as in all other, so it falleth forth heerin, that the ver∣tues of the wild kind is more effectuall then the tame. There are some among the Rhaetians and Germans, which eate the flesh heerof accoun∣ting it delicate, hauing first cut off the head and taile: they cannot abide the fume of rue, or of bitter almonds; there is nothing memorable, in the nature of this beast that I can learne, except that which is related by Aetius, that when men are bitten by Crocodils, this beast by a naturall instinct hating a Crocodill, will come about the wounded persons, o∣therwise fearing the presence of man. We may heerunto adde the beast which is bred in Armerica called Heyratt, spoken of by Theuetus : which name signifieth a beast of Hony, and the reason is, because it desireth ho∣ny aboue measure, for it will climbe the trees, and comming to the caues of Bees, it will with such dexterity, take out the Hony with their nailes, that it neither hurteth the Bees or receiueth harme by them. It is about the bignesse of a Catte, and of a Chesse-nut colour. OF THE COLVS. The name. T Here is among the Scithians and Sarmatians a foure-footed wild Beast called Colus, and of some Sulac in Latine; of the Polonians Sothac, Of the co∣lour. of the Moscouites Seigak, of the Tartari∣ans Akkijk and Snak, of the Turkes Akomi, being in quantity and stature betwixt a Ramme and a Hart, and dusky white colourd, a miraculous in her . bo. lib. 7. but the young ones yellow: of a singular swift∣nesse and celerity in course. Her manner is to drinke by the holes in her Nostrils, whereby she shuffeth vp aboundance of Water and carrieth it in her head, so that shee will liue in dry pastures remote from all moisture a great season, quen∣ching her thirst by that Cisterne in her head. Of the coun∣tries of their breede. They are most plentifull to be found in Tartaria, in Pontus, where are so many plaines that a man can see nothing but heauen and earth: likewise they are found in Moscouia, in Po∣docia, Of their hun¦ting and ta∣king. & about the Ryuer Neprus, and Boristhenes : they can neuer be taken but by werisom∣nesse; wherefore if men follow them with Pipes and Timbrels, playing vpon them, they so weary themselues with leaping and running to and fro, being compassed in by multi∣tudes of men, that they fall downe for weakenesse, and so are taken. They liue in flockes together, sometimes fiue hundred; and after Easter in the spring, two hundred in a troupe: hauing a Snout like a Hogs, they endure much hunger but no cold. In March they dig vp with their Hornes, a certaine roote, whereof they eate, Of their pro∣creation. and pre∣sently their lust for generation encreaseth vnto rage; insomuch that for satisfieng therof they continue in that act both male & female, vntil they lose al strēgth of body, lying halfe dead on the earth by the space of 24. houres, not able to goe or stand: during which time, they are often taken aliue, but when they come againe to themselues, they rather dy then endure to be tamed. The flesh of them is very sweete and wholsome, they conceiue and bring forth for the most parte twinnes or two at a time; their greatest enemie is a Wolfe (for in the Winter and snow they hunt and kill them.) Their hornes are about foure palmes in length, growing vpright or bending very little & very sharp, wherewithall they can pierce the belly of a Horse or other beast that standeth ouer them: at the roote, they are about sixe ynches compasse, and so growing lesse and lesse to the top; one of them waigheth about nine ounces; the blade toward the point is transparent, being held against the light or sunne, because it is white and thin, but the neather part is dusky and thicker, and there∣fore it is not penetrable by the eie of man. There are about 14. circles like rings com∣passing about the horne, one aboue another, but the vppermost is not perfect. This horne is of great price, being a present for any Noble man, for in Turkey they are sold for sixe Craconian shillings; yet I know no other vse of them, but either to make hafts for kniues, or else hornes for Spectacles. This beast liueth altogether in the plaines, except in snow, and then he runneth into the Woods; where he may be taken more easily, and killed with the stroke of a Staffe. Mat: michon When the Tartarians know in what plaines they lye, their King commeth and with a mul∣titude of men compasseth them and wearieth them by musicke as aforesaid. All this was related to me, by one that had killed of them aboue two hundred with his owne hand, (saith that right honorable and most learned Gentleman Iohannes Bonarus Baoron of Bal∣szee a Polonian. ) OF THE CONY. A Mong the diuers kinds of Hares, conies haue the third rank, being therfore cal∣led in Latine Lepusculi (as it were litle hares) & sometime Leberidae as it wer a Le∣ueret or young Hare, as well as Cuniculus : whereof the reason is, that it maketh holes in the earth, Strabo Or the name for Cuniculus was a Latin word for a hole or caue in the earth, before it was taken for a cony▪ Scaphan in the singular, & Schephanim in the plural Leuit. 11. and Psal. 104. is taken in Haebrew for a cony or conies, & not for a Hedg-hog, as the Septu∣aginta translate, or for a Porcaspine, although they liue also in caues and secret places of the earth; Platina. Hermolaus. Polibius Grapaldus The etymo∣logy of the name. and therfore Choerogrillus or Choerogillius or Choerogryllinus cannot signifie a cony: as the Septuagints translate Scaphan, but a Hedg-Hog, as the word deriued from the face of a Hog doth most euidently declare, which can by no means agree with a Cony. In the 14. of Deut. the word. Scaphan is ioyned with a Hare, because it is a beast neere of kind vnto it, for it is euident, that both of them chew the cud, howsoeuer a cony hath not a simple clo∣uen foot into two parts. A cony also is called Adapes, because of the roughnes of his feet; The Chaldee calleth it Thapsa, the Arabians Vebar, the Persian Beganzerah, & the Arabians following somtime the Greeke, call it Alraneb, that is, Hares. The Graecians call it vulgar∣ly Skele and Dasipos Couniclos, Scunax, and Lagis, Georychios a Hare digging, liuing in the earth. The Italians call it conigli, the French counin ; the paniards coneio ; the Germans, Kinnigle or Kunel, and sometime Kunlein ; the Illyrians Kralik or Krolijk. Their count. Munsterus There are few countries wherein conies doe not breed, but the most plenty of all is in England, they are also in an Island where are but few men neere vnto Dicaearcha, or as it is now called Puteoli in Italy. Likewise in all Spain, especially in those parts neere vnto Lom∣bardy, Athaeneus. whereupon Appius in Varro did write to one of his acquaintance which had tarryed long in Spain, that he thoght he was there folowing or hunting of conies, because as their multitude is great, so it would aske long time to take them. Among the Baleares are also great store of conies, Pliny. and once they so abounded there, that the people wer constraind to entreat at the handes of Augustus, a military company of Pioners to destroy them, and when camillus was besieging the citty Veij in Italy, he learned of the conies, which had vndermined a whole citty in Spain, Ʋ rro. likewise to take and ouerthrow that citty by their ex∣ample of vndermining, whereupon Martiall said: Monstrauit tacitas hostibus ille vias. Vegetius saith, that the prouerbe cuniculos agere tooke his beginning, when one by secret vnderminings and not by open violence ouerthroweth a Towne or nation. There are al∣so saith Albertus great store of wilde conies in Bohemia, so like a Hare as one beast may be like another, saue onely they seeme stronger, and are shorter and lesser-which thing cau∣sed Baptista Fiera to write thus: credideram leporem sic forma simillima fallit, Ambo super foetant, dente vel aure pares. Pet. Matyr likewise affirmeth in his Ocaean Decades, that in curiana a region of the new foūd worlde, are conies for colour, quantity, and haire, like Hares, which the inhabitantes call Vitias, Their partes & members. and there are two litle Islands caled cuniculariae, which seeme to be denominated of conies, standing betwixt corsica and Sardinia. For their seueral parts, they are most like vn∣to a Hare, except in their head and taile which is shorter, and their colour which is alway brighter, Agricola. Aelianus. The vse of their skinnes crescennensis and lesse browne and sandy: or else sometimes conies are white, black, gryseld, tauny, blewish, yellow-spotted, ash-coloured, and such like. And Alysius saith, that in some places, they are also greene, and their skinnes are of great vse through the world, especi∣ally in all the North and East for garments, facings, and linings. The gray and yellowish are the worst, but the white and blacke are more pretious, especially of the English, if the blacke be aspersed with some white or siluer haires: and in their vse the Buckes are most durable, yet heauier and harsher. The belly is most soft, gentle, & easie, & therfore more set by, The vse of their flesh. Pliny. although of lesse continuance. Their flesh is very white and sweet, especially of the young ones, being about fourteen or twenty daies olde, and some haue deuised a cruell delicate meat, which is to cut the yong ones out of the dams belly, and so to dresse and eat them, but I trust there is no man among christians so inhumanely gluttonous, as once to deuise or approue the sweetnes of so foule a dish: but the tame ones are not so good, for in Spaine, they will not eat of a tame cony, because euery creature doth partake in tast of the ayre, wherein he liueth, and therfore tame conies which are kept in a close and vnsweet ayre, by reason of their owne excrementes, cannot tast so well, or be so wholesome as those which run wilde in the mountaines and fields, free from all infection of euill ayre, They loue aboue all places the rockes, and make Dennes in the earth, The places of their abod and whereas it is said, Psal. 104. that the stony rocks are for the cony, it is not to be vnderstood as though the feet of the cony could pierce into the rocke, as into the earth, and that she diggeth hir hole therein as in looser ground; but that finding among the rocks holes, already framed to her hand, or else some light earth mingled therewith, she more willingly entreth there∣into, as being more free from raine & floods then in lower and softer ground: for this cause they loue also the hils and lower grounds and woods where are no rocks, as in En∣gland which is not a rocky countrey, but wheresoeuer she is forced to liue, there she dig∣geth hit-holes, wherein for the daytime she abideth, but morning & euening commeth out from thence, and sitteth at the mouth thereof. In their copulation they engender like Elephants, Tigres, and Linxes, that is, Their copu∣lation and procreation. Tho. Gypson. the male leapeth on the backe of the female, their priuy parts being so framed to meet one another behind, because the females do render their vrine backward: their secrets and the seed of the male are very small. They begin to breed in some countryes, being but sixe moneths old, but in England at a yeare old, and so continue bearing euery moneth, at the least se∣uen times in one yeare, if they litter in March, but in the winter they do not engender at al; and therefore the authors say of these and Hares, that they abound in procreation, by reason whereof, a little store wil serue to encrease a great borough. Their young being lit∣tered are blind and see not til they be 9. dayes old, and their dam hath no suck for them, til she hath bene six or seauen houres with the male, Tho. Gypson. at the least for sixe houres after she can∣not suckle them, greatly desiring to go to the Bucke, and if she be not permitted present¦ly, shee is so farre displeased, that she wil not be so inclined againe for 14. daies after. I haue bin also credibly informed by one that kept tame conies, that he had Does which littered three at a time, and within fourteene daies after, they littered foure more. Their ordinary number in one litter is fiue, and sometimes nine, but neuer aboue: and I haue seene that when a Doe hath had nine in her belly, two or three of them haue perished and bene oppressed in the wombe by suffocation. The males will kill the young ones, if they come at them like as the Bore-cats, and therefore the female doth also auoid it carefully, The cruelty of the males and of some females. couering the nest or litter with grauell or earth, that so they may not be discouered: there are also some of their females very vnnaturall, not caring for their yong ones, but suffer them to perish, both because they neuer prouide a warme littour or nest for them, as al∣so because they forsake them being littered, or else deuoure them. For the remedy of this euill, he that loueth to keepe them for his profit, must take them before they be deli∣uered, and pull off the haire or flesh vnderneath their belly, and so put it vpon their nest, that when the young one commeth forth, it may not perish for cold, and so the dam will be taught by experience of paine to do the like herselfe: Thus farre Thomas Gypson an En∣glish physitian. For Conies you may giue them Vine-leaues, Fruits, Herbes, Grasse, Bran, Their meat and food Oatmell, Mallowes, the parings of Apples; likewise Cabadges, Apples themselues, and Lettuce; and I my selfe gaue to a cony blew wolfe-baine, which she did presently eat with out hurt, but Gallingale and blind Nettle they will not eat. In the winter they wil eat hay, the danger in their meat & drinke oats and chaffe, being giuen to them thrice a day: when they eat greenes they must not drinke at all, for if they do, it is hazzard but they will incurre the Dropsie: and at other times they must for the same cause drink but litle, and that little must be alway fresh. It is also dangerous to handle their yong ones, in the absence of the dam, for hir iealousie will easily perceiue it, which causeth her so to disdain thē, that either she biteth, forsaketh, or killeth them. Foxes wil of their own acord hunt both Hares & conies, to kil and eat them. Albertus the medicins in a Cony. Touching their medicinall properties, it is to be obserued that the brain of conies hath bin eaten for a good Antidot against poyson: so also the Hart which is hard to be disgest∣ed, hath the same operation that is in triacle. There is also an approued medicine for the Squinancy or Quinsie: take a liue cony, & burn her in an earthen pot to pouder, then take a spoonful of that pouder in a draught of wine, and drink the most part thereof, and rubbe your throat with the residue, and it shal cure with speed and ease, as Marcellus saith. The fat is good against the stopping of the bladder and difficulty of vrine being anointed at a fire vpon the hairy place of the secrets (as Alex. Benedictus affirms.) Other things, I omit con¦cerning this beast, because as it is vulgar, the benefits thereof are commonly known. Of the Indian little Pig-Cony. I Receiued the picture of this Beast from a certain Noble-man, my louing friend in Paris, whose partes it is not needefull to describe, seeing the ymage it selfe is perspicuous and easie to be obserued. The quantity of this beast doth not exceede the quantity of a vulgar Coney, but rather the body is shor∣ter, yet fuller, as also I obserued by those two, which that no∣ble and learned Physitian Ioh. Munzingerus sent me. It hath 2. litle low ears, round and almost pild without hair, hauing also short legs, 5. claws vpon one foot behind, and six before: teeth like a mouse, but no taile, and the colour variable. I haue seene of them all white, and all yellow, and also different from both those: their voyce is much like the voice of a pigge, and they eat all kinds of Herbes, Fruites, Oats, and Bread; and some giue them water to drinke, but I haue nourished some diuers moneths together, and neuer giuen them any water, but yet I gaue them moyst foode, as Herbes, Apples, Rapes, and such like, or else they would incurre the Dropsie. Their flesh is sweet for meat, of a yellowship colour, like the Lard of Swine, and there∣fore not so white as is our vulgar Cony: they do not dig like other Coneys, and for the farther description of their nature, I will expresse it in the wordes of Munzingerus afore∣said; for thus he writeth. ONe of the males is sufficient in procreation for seuen or nine of the females, and by that means they are made more fruitful, but if you put them one male to one femal, then will the venereous salacity of the male procure abortment. It is affirmed, that they go threescore daies with young before they litter, and I saw of late one of them beare 8. at one time in her wombe, but three of them were stifled. They bring forth in the winter, and their whelpes are not blind as are the conies. They are no way so harmefull as other are, either to bite or dig, but more tractable in hand; howbeit vntamable. If two males be put to one female, they fight fircely, but they will not hurt the Rabbets. As the male is most libidinous, so doeth he follow the female with a little murmuring noyse, bewraying his appetite for generation, without wrath, and these are also called Spanish conies, by Peter Martyr, whose nature except in their abundant suprefaetation commeth nearer to Hogs then Conies. OF THE FALLOW DEERE, commonly called a Bucke and a Doe. T Here are some beastes (saith Pliny ) which nature hath fra∣med to haue hornes grow out of their head, like fingers out of a hand, and for that cause they are called Platicerotae : the name. such is this vulgar fallow Deere, being therefore called ceruus palmatas, that is a palmed Hart, by reason of the similitude the horne hath with the hand and fingers. The Germaines call this beast Dam, and Damlin, and Damhirtz. The Italians Daino, and Danio ; the French, Dain, and Daim. The Spani∣ards Gamo, and Cortza ; the Craecians vulgarly at this daie Agrimi, and Platogna, and Aristole Prox : The Latines Da∣ma, Gaza and Damula, becuse ( ae manu ) that is, it quickly flyeth from the hand of man, hauing no other defence but her heeles; and the female proca, and the Polonians Lanij. It is a com∣mon beast in most countries, being as corpulent as a Hart, but in quantity resembleth more a Roe, except in colour. . The males haue hornes which they loose yearely, but the females none at al: their co∣lour diuers, but most commonly branded, or sandie on the backe, like the furrow of a new plowed fielde, hauing a black strake downe all along the backe, a taile almost as long as a Calues, their bellies and sides spotted with white, which spots they loose in their old age, and the females doe especially vary in colour, being sometimes all white, and therefore like vnto Goats, except in their haire which is shorter. The horns of this beast are carried about euery where to be seene, and therefore this is also likely to be the same beast which Aristotle called Hippelaphus as some would haue it; yet I rather thinke that Hippelaphus was like to that rare seene horsse which Francis the first of that name king of France, had pre∣sented vnto him for a gift: What Hippe¦laphus is which was engendred of a horse and a Hart, and therefore can haue no other name then Hippelaphus, signifieng a Horsse-hart. In the blood of these kind of Deere are not strings or Fibres, wherefore it doth not con∣geale as other doth, Aristotle A secret in the blood. and this is assigned to be one cause of their fearefull nature; they are also saide to haue no gall: in their hornes they differ not much from a Hartes (except in quantity) and for their other parts they much resemble a Roe-bucke: their flesh is good for nourishment, but their blood doth increase aboue measure melancholy, which cau∣sed Hiera to write thus of it, after his discourse of the Roe. Damula aduslam gis si matris ab vbere repta est, Haic prio in nostro forte erit orbelecus: For the preparation or dressing of a Bucke, we shall say more when wee come to the de∣scription of a Hart. Albertus translateth the word Algazell a fallow Deere, and sayeth that the flesh thereof is very hurtfull, being cold and dry and bringeth the Hemmorhoides if it be not well seasoned with Pepper, Cinnamon, mustard seed, and hony, or else Garlick, which caused Iuuenall to cry out vpon the excesse of richmen for their feasts and delicate fare, being compared with the ancients which liued vpon fruits, in these words folowing as they are left in his eleuenth Satyre. Olmi ex quauis arbore mensa fiebat, At nunc diuitibus caenandi nulla voluptas: Nil Rhombus nil dama sapit putere videntur Vnguentum atque rosae, &c. The dung or fime of this Beast mingled with oyle of Myrtles, increaseth haire, and a¦mendeth those which are corrupt. Of the me∣dicines If the tongue heereof be perfumed vnder a leech or ticke that sticketh in the throat of man or beast, it causeth the leech to fall off presently; and the pouder of such a tongue helpeth in a Fistula, some of the late writers do prescribe the fat of a moul, of a Deere, and of a Beare mingled togither to rub the head withall for increase of memory. Of the second kind of Deere the ROE-BVCKE. T Here is so great difference among writers about the name of this beast, that it is a difficult and hard matter to set downe certainely, in the prime and origi∣nal tongues, the true and perfect denomination thereof, yet I will endeauour to goe as neere the marke as can be, by laying togither all the probabilities that I find in other, The seuerall names. or obserue by my selfe. To be∣gin The representation both of Male and Female. therefore with the Haebrew as the fountaine of all the residue, they call it Zebi, and the feminin herof Zebiah, and therefore in Deut. 14, it is per∣mitted to the Iewes to eate: and the plurall of the Masculine is Zebaim, and of the feminine Zebaoth. The Chaldee translation calleth it Thabia, which in the Acts of the Apostles cap. 9. is called Tabitha, & is interpreted Dorcas, a Roe: and sure it is probable that the Haebrewes so call a Roe, because of the out¦ward beauty thereof, being full of spots vppon a ground or skin of another colour, shew∣ing with great delight pleasant to the beholders, which caused Martiall to write this Disti∣con; Delitium paruo donabis dorcada nato, Iactatis solet hanc mittere turba togis. The Persians call this beast Ahu. The Arabians, Thabiu, which commeth neere to the chal∣dee word, the Germans Reeh or Rech, and the male Rech-bocke, and the female Rech-geise The Illyrians Serna or Sarna ; the French Chireau, & eheureulsauuage. The Spaniard, Zo∣rito, or cabronzillo-montes, the Italians capriolo, and cauriolo for the male, and capriola, and cauriola for the female. The Graecians Dorcas as the Septuagints do euery where translate, which Strabo ter∣meth corruptly Zorces, also Dorx Kemas, Nebrous, and vulgarly at this day Zarkadi ; and Dorcalis Dorcadion, for a little Roe. The Latines do also vse the worde Dorcas in common with the Graecians, and beside caprea and capreolus for a little Goat, for I do not thinke that any learned man, can finde any difference betwixt caprea and capreolus, The reason of the latine name. except in age and quantity. The reason of these two latter names is, because of the likenesse it hath with a Goat, for Goats as we shal shew in their description haue many kinds distinguished from one another in resemblaunce, but in the hornes a Roe doth rather resemble a Hart, for the female haue no hornes at all. These beasts are most plentifull in Affricke, beyond the Sea of carthage, but they are of another kind then those which Aristotle denied to be in Affrica : there are also in Egypt, Auicen. The Coun∣tries breed∣ing Roes. Marcellus Albertus. Pliny. Strabo Their nature and seueral parts. & in Germany, and in the Heluetian Alpes. Likewise in catadupa beyond Nilus, in Arabia, in Spaine, and in Lycia : and it is to be obserued that the Lycian Roes doe neuer goe ouer the Syrian Mountaines. Aelianus doth deliuer these thinges of the Lybian Roes, which for the colour and parts of their body may seeme to belong to all. They (saith hee) are of an admirable velocity or swiftnes, but yet inferiour to the Lybian horses, their belly is parted with blacke strakes and drops, and the other parts of their body are of a red yel∣lowish colour, they haue long feet, but longer eares, their eies blacke, and their horns are an ornament to their heads. Their swiftnesse doth not onely appeare vpon the earth but also vpon the Waters, for with their feet they cut the waters when they swim as with oares; and therefore they loue the lakes & strong streames, breaking the floods to come by fresh pasture, as sweet rushes and Bul-rushes. Their hornes grow onely vpon the males, and are set with sixe or seauen braunches, S rpsius but the females haue none, and therfore also they differ in horne from the fal∣low-deere: so as they cannot be called Platycerotae, for their Hornes are not palmed like a hand, Albertus and although they be branchy, yet are they shorter: they differ not much from the common Deere, but in their horne: and whereas the hornes of other beastes are hollow toward the roote, whereunto entreth a certaine bony substance, the hornes of these (as also of the vulgar Bucke and the Elke) are solide, without any such emptinesse; onely, they are full of pores. Pliny. P anias. Vi ll us. E chach. Of their eie-sight. It hath also beene beleeued, that a Roe doth not change her hornes, be∣cause they are neuer found; whereas in truth, they fall off yearly as doth a Harts, but they hide them, to the intent they should not be found. It hath likewise beene thought, a Roe was called in Greeke Dorcas, because of the quick∣nes of hir sight, Origen super ca t. Tex or. and that she can see as perfectly in the night as in the day; and not onely for her selfe, but the learned Physitians haue obserued, a certaine viscous humour about hir bowels, which being taken forth and annoynted vpon a mans eies, which are darke, heauy, pliny. and neere blind, it hath the same effect to quiken his eie-sight. It is also said of them that they neuer winke, no not when they sleepe, for which conceit, their blood is prescri∣bed for them that are pur-blind. The taile of this beast is shorter and lesser then is the fal∣low-Deeres, Cardanus insomuch as it is doubtfull whether it be a taile or not. The place of their aboade They keepe for the most part in the Mountaines among the rocks, being very swift, and when they are pursued by Dogs, ( Martiall saith) they hang vpon the rocks by their horns to deceiue the dogs, after a strange manner ready to fall and kill themselues, and yet haue no harme, whether the Dogs dare not approch as appeareth in this Epigram: Pendentem summa capream de rupe videbis Casuram speres, decipit illa cones: yet this doth better agree with the wild Goat then with the Roe, as shall be manifested in due time. Their con∣cord with o∣ther beasts Columello Aelianus saith, that the Cynoprosopy, men with Dogs faces liue vpon the flesh of Roes and Bugles, in the wildernesse of Egypt: and also it is vsuall to conclude them in Parks, for they wil agree very naturally with Hares and Swine; wherfore in the Lordship which Varro bought of Piso, it was seene how at the sound of a Trumpet, both Roes and Boares, would come to their vsuall places for meate: and although they bee naturally very wilde, yet will they quickly grow tame and familiar to the hand of man, for Blondus did nourish many at Rome. Being wilde they are hunted with Dogs, shot with Guns, taken in nets, of their ta∣king. but this falleth out sildome, because they liue most among the rocks. They are most easily taken in the woods. When they are chased, they desire to run a∣gainst the wind, because the coldnesse of the aire refresheth them in their course, and therefore they which hunt them place their Dogs with the wind, for sometimes against the hunters minds, Bellisarius do what t ey can to the contrary, she taketh hir course that way: but Harts when they heare the barkings of Dogs, run with the wind, that the sauor of their feet may passe away with them. They are often takē by the counterfaiting of their voice, which the hunter doth by taking a leafe and hissing vpon it. Cresconius The vse of their flesh. They are very good meate (as Philostratus affirmeth) and that the Indians dresse at their feasts whole Lyons and Roes for their ghests to eate, and the Sophists in their banket which is described by Athaeneus, had Roes therein: and therefore Fiera preferreth it before the fallow-deere, alledging the agreement that is betwixt it and the body of man, being dressed according to Art. Hic optata feret nobis fomenta calore, Simion Sethi Auicenna. Tr anus Vda leui modicis mox que coquenda focis. And therefore also affirmeth, that it excelleth all wilde beastes whatsoeuer, being not onely fitte for nourishment but for the sicke, as for them that haue the Chollicke, or the falling euill, or the Timpanie, and therefore they are best at a yeare olde or vnder. Likewise, their broath with Pepper, Loueage, seede of Rue, Parsley, Hony, Mustardseed and Oyle; Apicius and for sauce to the meate they take Pepper, Rue, Hony melted, and an onyon: sometime also they seeth the hanches or hippes, and make Pasties of the sides and ribbes. It is a Beast full of feare, and therefore the flesh thereof although it be very dry; Of the dispo∣sition & pas∣sion. yet will it engender some melancholy; of the feare Martiall saith thus: Tam despar aquilae columba non est. Hec dorcas rigido fugar leoni. As the Doue from the Eagle, and the Roe from the Lyon, which afterward grew vnto a Pro∣uerbe. It hath also some Epethets among Authors, which doe confirme their disposition ful of feare: as flying, weake, wanton, and such like; yet will they fight one with another so fiercely, that sometime they kill each other. They feare also the Wolfes, whereof came the prouerbe, Their ene∣mies in na∣ture. that first of all the Roes wil be ioyned to the Wolfes, to expresse an incredible matter. They haue also beene vsed for Sacrifice to Diana, for the Saphriae Women in Patras, did lay vpon hir great altar whole Harts, Bores, Roes and other beasts aliue: and the Coptitae did eate the Males; Sacrifices of Roes. but religiously worshipped the females, not daring to eate them, Pausanias. Aelianus because they beleeued that Isis loued them dearely. Of these Beasts came the Islands Capreae beyond Surrentum into Campania, where Ti∣berius had a famous Castle, and was ennobled by his presence; but since the decay there∣of, it is now celebrated for the multitude of quailes that are found therein. The medici∣nes arising from a Roe. Marcellus The remedies or medicines comming from this Beast are these: first, the flesh of them eaten, is good against all paines in the small guts, for it dryeth and stayeth the belly. Pliny affirmeth, that the teeth of a Dragon tyed to the sinnewes of a Hart in a Roes skinne, and wore about ones necke, maketh a man to be grations to his superiors, and them to be fa∣uorable and pitifull to him in all his supply cations: And if the white flesh in the brest of an Hiaena, and seuen haires thereof with the genitall of a Hart, betyed in a piece of a Roes skinne, and hanged about a Womans necke, it maketh that her wombe shall suffer no a∣bortements; but these things are triuiall, and not to be beleeued but at pleasure. I know that the taile of a Dragon tyed to the Nerues of a Hart in a Roes skinne, the sewet of a Roe with Goose-grease, the marrow of a Hart and an onyon, with Rozen & running lime, doe wonderfully help the falling euill, (if it be made into a plaister.) Sextus saith, that if one giue the braine of a Roe drawen or pressed through a ring to an infant, it will preserue him for euer from the falling sicknesse and apparitians. The Li∣uer of a Roe sod in salt Water, and the eyes of a purblind man held ouer the fume or reak thereof, are cured of their blindnesse: and some seeth it in a little cup, and annoynt the eies with the scumme or froth comming from it. The same liuer being burned to poul∣der, and the dust cast on a man bleeding, staieth the yssue or fluxe. The gall of this beast mixed with Wine, and the meale of Lupines the waight of a groate, and Hony, take away the spots of the face & the same gal mixed with water, helpeth a sun-burned face, and frec∣kles: The same with Hony Atticke, taketh away the dimnes from the eies, & with the iuyce of a gourd annoynted vpon the eie browes, causeth that where the haire hath beene pul∣led off, that it neuer shal grow againe; and this gall is alway the better for the age thereof, and as Hypocrates did prescribe, it must be kept in a siluer pipe or boxe. For the tingling of the eares, take with this gall the Oyle of Roses, with the iuyce of an Onyon beaten together, and instilled warme into the eares for a present remedy: so also, with the oyle of Roses onely, it helpeth the payne in the teeth, and with the hony at∣ticke, all swellings and paines in the iawes or chappes, putting thereto Myrrhe, saffron, Sextus and Pepper. The same gall with a little hoggs-bread, and the poulder of burnt Alumme with Anyse seede, made into a suppository, procureth loosenes, if the party haue not the Hemerrhoides. Also the gaull taken with hony and the iuyce of Eglantine, Aetius. cureth the exulceration of the virile member by annoynting it. The Spleene being drunke, helpeth windinesse, and the melt is commended against the chollicke and the biting of serpents. Against the laundise they take the dung of a Roe dryed and sifted, and drinke it in wine: Galen. the same also so drunke, cureth the Ague: and bycause the Roe-bucke doth wonderfully loue his female, there be some that affirme, that if a woman eate the bladder of a Roe, it will likewise make her husband to loue her exceedingly.

T Here is another kind so like a Deere (although conceiued of a Bucke-Goate and a female Hart) that I cannot but expresse the figure and briefe narration thereof in this place. of the gene∣ration of this beast. It is like a Deere (except the beard and the bristles growing about the shoulders) and Pliny affirmeth that they are found about the riuer Phasis, in Arabia and Arachotae, which is a Citty of India so called of Arachotus a riuer issuing from Caucasus which the Graecians call Tragelaphos, Athenaeus The coun∣tries of this beast and the name heerof. and the Germans ein Brandhirse, and some thinke this beast to be mentioned by the name of Ako in Deut. 14. This doubtles is the same beast which Aristo∣tle calleth Hippelaphus, because he attributeth the selfe same things to it that Pliny ascribeth to this, both for the beard, the bristles, and deepe haire about the shoulders, which hang∣eth downe like the mane of a horse. The similitude both in proportion and quantity holdeth with a Hart in the feete which are clouen, and that the female thereof doth want hornes. The hornes of the male are like the hornes of a Roe. Therefore howsoeuer some haue imagined that there is no such Beast to be found in the world, they are rather to be pittied then confuted, for it is not to be doubted, that neither the auncients nor other euer haue seene all the diuers and mar∣uailous shapes of Beastes, which are to be found in many remote and far distant places of the world, especially in Arabia and India, where are many desarts; and therefore the rea∣son why they affirme this, is because they neuer saw any such, and so it is to be vnderstood: for the rare pictures of these beasts called in ancient time Canathra, Zenophon. Plutarch. Coelius whereupon children were carried in Pageants and shewes, gaue them occasion to think that these were but mens de∣uises, and that God neuer ordained such creatures. Georgius Fabritius which sent me this Picture, doth among other thinges write vnto me very probably that this kinde is onely distinguished from other informe, name, and strength, and not in kind: and this being more strange and lesse knowne among men, was called by the Graecians Tragelaphus, be∣ing greater then the vulgar Deere, deeper haired, and blacker in colour, Of the parts. and this (saith he) is taken in the ridings or forrests of Misena, bordering vppon Bohemia, and the com∣mon sort of hunters hold opinion, that by reason it loueth to lie where Coles are made, Of the coun∣tries of this beast. and in their dust, feeding vpon such grasse as groweth in those places, that therefore the Germanes call it Brandhtrze, and so the Foxes which resemble them in colour, are called Brandfusche. It is for certaine that these are greater and stronger then Harts, Agricola Of their strength and colour. their vpper part of the backe being blacke, and the neather neere the belly not White (as in a Hart) but rather blackish; but about his genitals very blacke. I haue seene the hornes to haue seauen spires or braunches, growing out of one of them, being palmed at the top. These are like to those which are called Achaeines in Greeke, by reason of their paine and sorrow: and Kummerer in Germane, by cause they liue in continuall sorrow for their young ones, while they are not able to runne out of their dennes, belike fearing by some instinct of nature, A secret in their pa sion. least their tender and weake age, should betray them to the hunters, before they be able to runne away. THE FIGVRE OF ANOTHER Tragelaphus or Deere-goate, expressed by BELLONIVS. T Here is another Tragelaphus (saith he) whereof I finde no name among the French: it wanteth a beard, The descrip∣tion of his se¦uerall parts. and the Haire thereof resembleth an Ibex-goate (whose description follow∣eth afterward among Goates:) the hornes heereof are like a Goats, but more crooked and bending, compassing be∣hinde as a Rammes doe, which he neuer looseth. His face, Nose, and eares, are like a sheepes, the skinne of his Cods being very thicke and hanging downe. His Legs are white like a sheepes, his taile white; his haires are so long about his necke and stomacke, that you would thinke it were bearded. His haire on the shoulders and brest blacke, and it hath two gray spots on his flanks on ei∣ther side: the Nostriles are blacke, the beake or face White; so also is the belly beneath, but the description heereof seemeth rather to agree with a Pygargus, or Musmon, of which I shall speake afterward. I doe rather approue the relation of another of this kinde, which was sent vnto me by that most learned English Physition Iohn Cay, which as he writeth vnto me, was brought in the yeare 1561. out of the Countrey of Mauritania, which was clouen-footed and liueth for the most part in the Mountaine partes of that Countrey, being in quantity betwixt a fallow-deere and a Hart, the body more like a Hart, and the side branded and hanging downe: a shorter and thicke necke, the colour in the Winter blacke, and red, set one with another, the beard like a Goate, but more deuided and turned backeward; his haire very long euen to his knees, a mane full of bristles, stretched out in length through his whole necke, but especially about the toppe of the shoulder blades, where it standeth like bun∣ches, being in colour darker then in other parts of the body; and the hinder Legges are couered with longer and harder haires downe to the pasterne, (as I thinke) for no other cause but to defend them from harme in his leaping: and the hoofe of this beast was more strange (for being clouen as is saide before) the outward hoofe of his sore-legges is lon∣ger and greater then the inward, A secret in the hoofe. and contrary in the hinder: and the inward cloue there∣of is longer and greater, and the outward smaller and shorter, so as on either side you would thinke one of them was the hoofe of a Goate, and the other of a Hart, both of them hollow and without soales; whereof I can giue no other reason, then the pleasure of na∣ture, which hath so prouided, that whereas this beast liueth among the rockes, and sharp places of the Mountaines, his foote-steps are by his hollow hoofes more firme and stable, because by that means, the stones and sharp pointed rocks entreth into them to stay them vp from slyding: but it is more strange in the females hoofes, for they haue vpon the top and vpper face of them three or foure pleasant impressions (as it were of carued or imbro∣dered flowers, if a man marke them earnestly,) which I think are giuen vnto them only for ornament and delight. Either sexe loose euery yeare their hoofes, and Harts doe their Hornes, that nature may shew their resemblance in their feet to a Hart, as he doth in their head to a Goat. His eare is short like a Goats, but his eie, genitall, stones, and taile, like a Harts, though som∣what shorter. The hornes like a Rammes, crooked and distinguished in the middle, by a blacke line all their length, which is two Roman feete and one finger, and in compasse at the roote, one foot, one palme, and a halfe, standing one from another, where they dif∣fer most not aboue one foote, three palmes, one finger and a halfe. The rugged circles going about them, toward the top are bunchy, and toward the bottom or roote they are low, with beaten notches or impressions. Their quan∣tity in length and breadth. They are not at the top distant one point from another, aboue one foote and a palme. The length of their face, from the Crowne to the tip of the Nose, one foote, and three fingers: the breadth in the forehead where it is broadest, two palmes and one finger. The height of this beast not aboue three foote and a halfe, except where his mane stand∣eth, and the whole length heere of from the crown of the head to the taile is foure feet and a halfe and two fingers. It hath onely teeth beneath on the neather chap, and those in number not aboue sixe, neither did I obserue any defect in them. It cheweth the cud like other clouen-footed beasts. The Nostrils are blacke, from whom the vpper lip is deuided by a long perpen∣dicular line. It is a gentle, pleasant and wanton beast, in the disposition, Of the de∣scription of this beast. rather resembling a Goate then a Hart, desiring the steepest and slipperyest places whereon it leapeth, and from whence (it is reptored) that it doth cast downe it selfe headlong vpon the hornes na∣turally, that by them it may breake the violence of his fall or leape, and then stayeth his body vpon the sore-knees. It will runne apace, but it is most excellent in leaping, for by leaping it ascendeth the highest Mountaines and rockes. The females are greater then the males, but not in Horne or Haire, it eateth Grasse, Oates, Cheas ill, Hay, and Bread, they bring forth twinnes euery time: and this we call in England a Barbary-Deere.

The nams of a hinde-calfe Also it is not to be forgotten, that they haue diuers other names to dinstinguish their yeares and countries, as for example: when they begin to haue hornes, which appeare in the second yeare of their age like Bodkins without braunches, which are in Latine called Subulae, Aristotle. Pliny. O Spittards & Subulous. they are also cald Subulones for the similitude they haue with bodkins, and the Ger∣mans cal such an one Spirzhirtz which, in English is called a Spittard, and the Italians cor∣biati, but the french haue no proper name for this beast that I can learn vntil he be a three yearing, and then they call him ( ein Gabler ) which in Latine are called Furcarij. And indeed I was once of this opinion that these Subulones were only two-yearing Harts, vntil I consulted with a Sauoyen of Segusium, Of Brocar∣des. who did assure me from the mouths of men traind vp in hunting wild beasts from their youth, that there are a kind of Subulones which they call also Brocardi with straight and vnforked hornes except one branch, in the moun∣taine of Iura neare the lake Lemanus, and that these also do liue among other Hartes, for there was seene neere a monastry called the Roman Monasterie by certaine hunters, in the yeare 1553. a vulgar Hart with branched hornes, and his female, and likewise with a Su∣bulon or Brocarde, which when in pursuit he was constrained to leape from rocke to rock, to get to the Water, he brake his legge and so was taken. These Brocards are as great in quantity as other vulgar Hartes, The quanti∣ty of Bro∣cards. but their bodies are leaner and they swifter in course. Of their horns. They haue but one braunch growing out of the stem of their horne, which is not big∣ger then a mans finger, and for this cause in the rutting time, when they ioyne with their females, they easily ouercome the vulgar Hart, with his branched and forked hornes. The hunters call this Brocard the shield-bearer to the residue, for by him they are deliuerd be∣ing hunted: for whereas it is the nature of the vulgar Hart, to get into ditches, and hide himselfe in hollow places when he heareth the hounds, this beast neuer coueteth any se∣cret place to couer himselfe, but runneth stil in the sight of dogs, who leaue the other that hide themselues, because they keepe this on foot: and so when the hunters are passed by the lurking harts, they returne back againe, being safe both from nets and dogs, while the poore Brocard is chased vnto death. These being old, are also known by their teeth and horns, for they neuer change them, but it is questionable whether they haue any hinds or females, although my Authour in∣formeth me, that he heareth ther be also hinds with horns like these, being not aboue one finger long; which if it be true, it is not improbable that these are the femals of that kind, wherunto I yeeld more easily, because the vulgar hinds wil not admit copulation with the Brocard, except they be constraind, and as it were rauished against their wil, from whence it commeth that they are so rare and seldom bred: their flesh is much sweeter then the vul∣gar harts. The figure of the face and hornes. I haue therefore heere expressed the figure of the heade of this beast with his hornes, which is also called Anamynta or a Burgundian Brocard, whose hornes are at the longest about eighteene inches long, and at the shortest about nine inches, wherof that part which cleaueth to the head is bunchy and in∣dented: the longest as they grow in length, do more and more stād out one from another turning vp at the top like a bowe, but the lesser do not stand out so farre, and bend very little at the point; and whereas in the vulgar harts the root of the horn is but in a round circle, as it were fastned vpon the scull of the beast, in this the bony rootes lie within the skinnes much deeper, as may be easily discerned by comparing both togi∣ther. The reason why I call this Burgundian hart or Subulon A∣namynta, is because it not onely wanteth the manifolde braunches of vulgar Hartes, but that also which is called Amynta. There are another sort of Harts called Achaini bred in Creet neere Achaea, Aristotle. Of the A∣chaian harts. whereas in all other partes of creet there are no Harts, wherof it is affirmed by Gaza that there was one of them which had a bough of greene Iuy growing in his hornes, it was coniectured that when it was young, some sprig of that Iuy was taken in a slifter of the horne, Gaza. a myracle in the horne of this beast. Athaeneus. which by reason of some nourishment it found in the horn naturall to that tree being like a rockye substance, it there grew to more perfection. These are also called Spathenae, although that terme be also giuen vnto vulgar Harts to signifie their full age, yet some are of opinion that this Achaenie Hart was but an inuention or figment made in bred, for there was in an∣tient time a kind of loafe called Achaines in the likenesse of a Hart. I receiued also of that learned man Iohn The picture of another face and hornes. Cay, another head out of England which he coniectureth to be the head of the pal∣med Bucke, as it was called by Iulius capi∣tolinus, which I do not take to differ from the fallow Deer: and yet because this see∣meth to be of the most excellent kind, I haue thought good to expresse it in this place, being farre different from all other hornes of this kinde of Beastes, and more beautifull. Harts are bred in most countries, Of the regi∣ons breeding Harts. Solinus. but the auncients do celebrate and preferre those of Britaine before other, where they are of diuers colours both white and blacke, as Pausanias affirmeth. In Oedor a region of Asia, toward the Northerne Ocaean, they ride vpon Harts; likewise there are arts in Scythia: and the people cald Me∣ditae which are subiect to the kings of Tar∣taria, make their Harts so tame, that they also ride vppon them: there are none in creet except in the region of the cydonites▪ there are also in the woods of Helvetia, but not so many as in time past because De∣mocraties do not nourish game and plea∣sures like vnto Monarchies, and therefore they are daily killed by the vulgar sort, there being no law against it.

There is a citty called Dora in Assiria, neere the banks of Euphrates, where are many flockes of Harts, of whom many times some are slaine with Darts, and others as they swim away to their accustomed solitudes are oppressed in the water by the weight of Oares, and so taken. They are for the most part sand-coloured, and intermingled with some white spots, especially the Hinds and their calues, and sometimes milk-white, Pollux. Varinus. Of the co∣lour.

Gellius. which happeneth vnto them by some defect in their nourishment before they be calued: and for natural imbecillity, so haue I seen white Bears, Hares, Quailes, Partridges, and Swallows. When Appolonius and his Colleagues trauelled by Paraca a citty of India, they sudden∣ly heard a noise like the sound of a pipe, and while they looked about to see what it signifi∣ed, they perceiued that it was the pipe of a keeper or Forrester, which gouerned a whole flocke of white Harts: such an one was the was the hart of Sertorius that Noble Captain, whereby he led his army, as they were perswaded by it, who affirmed that it was a Spanish Prophet or wizard giuen to him by a certain Lusitanian whom he took in an Island of Por∣tugall; saying moreouer that she was inspired by Diana, and that shee had authority from that Goddesse to admonish him, and make the harts of his souldiors cleaue fast vnto him, and therefore if at any time he miscaried in his proceedings, he could easily pacifie them from mutinies, in saying; that his hart set him vppon that enterprize, so putting off the fault cunningly from himselfe to the beast for feare of defection, wherfore also these wer vsed in the Bacchanals of Cracouia, and their flesh being softer, is peculiarly termed by the French Venaison. Of their horns, & the beauty of them. These do excell all other in the beauty of hornes, which are very high, yet grow they not to their bones or skalps, but to their skin, branching forth into many spieres, being solide throughout, and as hard as stones, and fall off once euery yeare, but if they remaine abroad in the aire, where some wind and raine fall vpon them, so as now they are wet, and anon dry againe, they grow as light as any vanishing or softer substance as I haue proued by experience, finding some which haue bin lost by them in the woods: wherefore I gather that they are of an earthly matter concrete and hardned with a strong heat made like vnto bones. It must be vnderstood that the males onely are horned, and yet haue they small benefite by them, because (as I saide) they growe but within theyr skin, and these also they loose euery yeare in the spring time At one yeare old they haue nothing but small bunches, as it were significations of their hornes to come growing on their head; at two yeares old they appeare more perfectly but straight and simple; at three yeares they grow forked into two spieres, at foure into three, and so increase euery yeare in their branches till they be six, and aboue that time you cannot certainly discerne their age by their heade, for their hornes or spieres grow not more in number although their years make them greater in quantity: yet the old Harts do want these two branches which the Graecians call Amynterai, and the Latines Adminicula, because they first come forth: and I haue heard that there were Harts horns in an Apothicaries shop of Antwerp, which had euerie one fifteene branches vpon one stem, which if it be true, it goeth beyond al ex∣perience. Euery yeare in the month of Aprill they loose their hornes, and so hauing lost them, The time of loosing their hornes. Pliny. they hide themselues in the day time, inhabiting the shadowy places, to auoide the annoyance of flies, and feed onely during that time in the night. Their new hornes come forth like bunches at the first, and afterward by the encrease of the Suns heate, they grow more hard, couered with a rough skinne, which the hunters for honours sake call a Vel∣uet head, and as that skinne dryeth, they daily try the strength of their new heade vppon trees, which not only scrapeth off the roughnes, but by the pain they feel in rubbing them, they are taught how long to forbear the company of their fellows; for at last when in their chafing or fretting of their new horne against a tree, they can no more feele any smart or greefe in them, they take it for high time to forsake their solitary dwellings, and return a∣gaine to their former condition, like one that is supplied with new arms, after the loosing of his old. The tender and new hornes the Germans call Morchi and Kolben : these being ta∣ken from the beast are accounted among great noble men a delicate dish of meat. Cyprius is said to haue a Hart with foure hornes, Aeliaenus a history of a Hart with 4. horns. which was called Nicocreos, and by him dedicated to Apollo, which I do therefore remember in this place, because it is seldome seene that a Hart can bear naturally aboue two horns. Authors do generallie affirm, that when a Hart hath lost his hornes, he hideth them in some secret place, because he vnderstandeth some secret vertues, are contained in them, which mankind seeketh for, and therefore he either enuying the good of other, or fearing least they bewray him heereafter to hunters, taketh the best care and prouidence his discretion can affoorde, that they neuer come to the han¦dling of men. When the people asked Apollo what they shoulde doe with Procles their Tyrant, the Oracle answerd that he should go to that place where Harts cast their horns: whereby it was gathered, that he should be slaine and buried in the earth, and this caused the prouerbe: Vbi cerui abijciunt cornua, to signifie a desperate busines: yet could it not be agreed, whether the Hart make more account of his right horne or his left, and therefore Aristotle affirmeth, Whether the right or left horn be most pretious. that the left horne is neuer found; and Pliny, that the right horn is ne∣uer found. This difference may be reconciled with ease, for right and left are so tearmed for three causes, or three manner of waies. First, properly in all creatures, according to the begin∣ning of motion. Secondlie, for similitude or likenesse, as the right and left side of Ima∣ges, statues, &c. Thirdly, improperly when the right side of one thing standeth a∣gainst the left side of another, being opposite, as when two men stande face to face, and by this reason may the left horne of Aristotle, and the right horne of Pliny signifie all one thing: but we know that the hornes of harts are found yearly both in fields & woods. The wilde Harts of Sarmatia neere Turky, haue the greatest hornes of all other, Of the horns of Turkey Harts. for it hath bene proued that one paire of them haue waighed forty poundes Troy weight and aboue: and there they loose their hornes in March, neither do they fall off together, but first one, and then the other, and after ther first falling, it is manifest that a certaine worm getteth on them and maketh vppon them many circles and little furrowes whereby the roote or basis being weakened, the horne groweth very white in that place, Bonarus and yet not without some apperaunce of blood remaining which cleaueth to it, from the first falling off: for, when the head of this Beast is disarmed, there yssueth blood from the scul, and in appearance the naked place is like a wound, and yet it is wonderful to marke, that within 3. daies the same is heald and filed with the blood which congealeth in that place first to a sinnue, and afterward to a hard bone, so as in August at the farthest, Orus The reasons why Hartes and Deere loose their horns yearly. the hornes are per∣fect, and therefore the Egyptians to describe a long-liued-man, picture a Hart loosinge his hornes euery yeare and new comming in their place. If any man be desirous to know the reasons, why onely beasts of this kind loose their hornes in this maner, I wil not spare my paines to set downe the best which Authors haue rendred for this woonder of na∣ture. First, because of the matter whereof they consist, for it is dry and earthy like the sub∣stance of green leaues, which fal off yearly, wanting glewing or holding moisture to con∣tinue them; and for this cause the horne of a hart cannot be bent. Secondly, from the place they grow vpon, for they are not rooted vpon the scull, but onely within the skin. 3. from their efficient cause, for they are hardned both with the heat of summer and cold of winter, by meanes whereof the pores to receiue their nourishing liquor, are vtterly shut vp and stopped, so as of necessity their natiue heat dyeth: which falleth not out in other Beasts whose hornes are for the most part hollow, and fitted for longer continuance, but these are of lesser, and the new bunches swelling vp toward the spring, do thrust off the old hornes, being holpe either by the boughes of trees, by the weight of the horns, or by the willing excussion of the beast that beareth them. Democritus and other (as Gillius and Aelia∣nus ) giue other reasons, but because they seeme to be far fetched, I wil omit them. A natural se∣cret of gel∣ded Deere. Aristotle. Pliny. Solinus. Yet by the waie it is to be noted, that if a hart be libbed or gelded when he is yong he neuer bea∣reth hornes, or verie smal ones, and if his horns be vpon him at the time of gelding, they neuer waxe lesse, or greater, or fall off. The hinds neuer beare hornes at all, as some haue affirmd, but I rather beleeue Caesar, Maximilian, and Zenodotus, who affirm vpon their kno¦ledge that hinds in some countries haue hornes like the males: as likewise it is obserued in the Elephants of India, and for this cause the Poets expressed the hinde which nourished Telephus with hornes, and that which Hercules tooke with Golden hornes, and it is for cer∣taine, that in Ethyopia and Lybia, both sexes haue hornes. The face of this beast is fleshy, his Nostrils flat, and his necke very long; his eares, The seuerall parts. some greater, and some smaller, but in the mount Elaphus and Hellespont, they are slit. It is obser∣ued, that when a Hart pricketh vp his eares he windeth sharpe, very far and sure, and dis∣couereth all treachery against him, but if they hange downe and wag, he perceiueth no danger. By their teeth is their age discerned, and they haue foure on both sides, Aristotle. where∣with they grind theyr meate, and besides two other much greater in the male then in the female, and they bend downward to bite withal. Aristotle. All these beasts haue worms in their heads bred vnderneath their tongue in a hollow place, where the neck-bone is ioyned to the heade, which are not bigger then such as Flyes blow in rotten flesh. They are ingendred together one with another, and they are in number twenty, as some would haue it, but I was giuen to vnderstand by one that sawe a heade of this beast dissected, wherein were many more Wormes, and not contained in one place, but spreade all ouer the head. The breast is by the Frenchmen called peculiarly Hampan, his blood is not like other beastes, for it hath no Fibres or small veines in it, and therefore it is hardly congealed. His heart is very great, as it so falleth out in all fearefull beasts, hauing in it a bone like a a crosse as shall be afterward manifested. His belly is not of one fashion as it falleth out in all other which chew the cud. He hath no gall, which is one cause of the length of his life, and therefore also are his bowels so bitter that the Dogges will not touch them, except they be very fat. The A∣chaian Harts are said to haue their gall in their tailes, and other say that Harts haue a gal in their eares. Aristotle pl n . The Harts of Briletum and Tharne haue their raines Quadrupled or foure-fould. The genitall part is all neruy, the taile small, and the Hinde hath vdders betwixt her thighes with foure speanes like a cow. Of their dis∣ osi ion. Pli y. A s c et to cu poyson. Both male and female are woonderfully swift and subtile as shall be shewed in the discourse of their hunting. They are also apt and cunning to swim, although in their swimming they see no land, yet doe they wind it by their noses. They chew the cud like other beasts. It is reported that when a Hart is stung by a Serpent, that by eating Elaphoscum : (that is, as some call it Harts eye, others Hart-thorne, or grace of God, others wilde Ditany,) it presently cureth the wound and expel∣leth the poyson; the same vertue they attribute to Polypodye, against the wound of a Dart. of their food agus Hauing thus entered into mention of their foode, it is to be farther obserued, that the males of this kind will eat Dwall or night-shade which is also called Deathes-hearbe, and they also loue aboue all other food wilde Elder, so as in the Summer time they keepe for the most part in those places where these plantes grow, eating the leaues onely, and not the boughes or sprigs: a secret in the Hind How Hartes draw serpēts out of theyr holes and wherefore they eat and deuoure thē. but the Hind will eat neither of both, except when she beareth a male in her belly, and then also by secret instinct of nature, she feedeth like a male. They will also eate Serpents, but whether for hatred to them, or for medicine they receiue by them, it is questionable. A Hart by his nose draweth a Serpent out of her hole, and there¦fore the Gramarians deriued Elaphos a Hart, from Elanein tous opheis, that is, of driuing a∣way Serpents. I cannot assent to the opinion of Aelianus, that affirmeth the Serpents follow the breath of a Hart like some Philtre or amorous cup; for seeing that all Authors hold an hostility in natures betwixt them, it is not probable that the Serpent loueth the breath of a beast, vnto whose whole body he is an enemy, with a perpetuall antipathy. And if any reply, that the warme breath of a Hart is acceptable to the cold Serpent, and that therefore she fol∣loweth it, as a Dogge creepeth to the fire, or as other beasts the beames of the Sunne, I will not greatly gaine-say it, seeing by that meanes it is most cleare, that the breath doeth not by any secret force, or vertue, extract and draw her out of the Denne, but rather, the concomitant quality of heate, which is not from the secret fire in the bones of the Hartes throat (as Pliny hath taught) but rather from her ordinary expiration, inspiration, and re∣spiration. For it cannot be, that seeing al the parts of a Serpent are opposite to a Hart, that there should be any loue to that which killeth her. For my opinion I thinke that the manner of the Harts drawing the Serpent out of her Den is not as Aelianus and Pliny affirmeth, by sending into the caue a warme breath which burneth and scorcheth the beast out of her den, but rather when the Hart hath found the Serpents nest, she draweth the aire by secret and violent attraction out from the Serpent, who to saue her life followeth the ayre out of her den, as when a vessell is broched or ven∣ted, the wine followeth the flying ayre, and as a cupping-glasse draweth blood out of a Scarified place of the body: so the Serpent is drawne vnwillingly to follow her destroi∣er, and not willingly as Aelianus affirmeth. Vnto this opinion both Oribasius in his commentaries vpon the Aphorismes of Hip∣pocrates and Gumterius his restorer do ioyntly agree: but the Serpent being thus drawne forth, addeth greater force to her poyson, whereupon the prouerbiall admonition did a∣rise. Cane ne incideris in serpentem, cum extracta a latebris anhelitu cerui, effugerit, tum enim propter, Aelianus. iracundiam vehementius ei venenum est, that is, Beware thou meete not with a Ser∣pent drawn out of her hole by the breth of a Hart, for at that time by reason of her wrath, her poison is more vehement. After this selfe same manner doe the sea-Rams, drawe the Sea-calfes hid in the Subterranean Rocks, for by smelling they preuent the ayr that should come vnto them for refrigeration. O pianus. Gillius. The fight be¦twixt Harts and Serpents There is many times strange conflicts betwixt the Hart and the Serpent, thus drawne forth, for the Serpent seeing her aduersary lifteth her necke aboue the ground, and grash∣eth at the Hart with her teeth, breathing out very bitter hissings: on the contrary, the Hart deriding the vaine endeuour of his weake aduersary, readier to fight then powerfull to harme him, suffereth him to embrace both his necke and Legges with his long and thin body, but at an instant teareth it into an hundred pieces. But the most strange combats are betwixt the Harts and Serpents of Libia, where the hatred is deeper; and the Serpents watch the Hart when he lyeth a sleepe on the ground, and being a multitude of them, set vpon him together, fastening their poysonfull teeth in euery part of his skinne; some on his necke and breast; some on his sides and backe, some on his Legges, and some hange vpon his priuy parts, biting him with mortall rage, to ouerthrow their foe. The poore Hart being thus oppressed with a multitude, and pricked with venemous pains assayeth to runne away, but all in vaine, their cold earthy bodyes and winding tailes, both ouercharge his strength, and hinder his pace: he then in a rage with his teeth, feete, and horne assaileth his enemies, whose speares are already entred into his body, tearing some of them in pieces, and beating other asunder: they neuer the lesse (like men) know∣ing that now they must dye rather then giue ouer and yeald to their pittilesse enemy, cleaue fast, and keepe the hold of their teeth vpon his body, although their other partes be mortally wounded, and nothing left but their heades, and therefore will dye together with their foe, seeing if they were asunder no compassion can delay or mitigate their natu∣rall vnappeaseable hatred. The Hart thus hauing eased himselfe by the slaughter of some, (like an Elephant) at the sight of their blood, be stirreth himselfe more busily in the eager battaile, and therfore treadeth some vnder foote in the blood of their fellowes, others he pursueth with tooth and horne, vntill he see them all destroyed: and whereas the heads hang fast in his skinne, for auoyding and pulling them forth, (by a deuine naturall instinct) he flieth or runneth to the Waters, where he findeth sea-crabs, and of them he maketh a medicine, whereby he shaketh off the Serpents heades, cureth their woundes, and auoideth all their poyson; this valiant courage is in Harts against Serpents, wheras they are naturally affraid of Hares and Conies, and will not fight with them. It is no lesse strange that Harts will eate Serpents; but the reason is, Etymologus. Varinus. for medicine and cure; for sometimes the pores of his body are dulled and shut vp; sometimes the worms of his belly doe asend into the roofe of his mouth, while he cheweth his cud, and there cleaue fast: for remedy whereof the Hart thus affected, runneth about to seeke for Ser∣pents, for his deuouring of a Serpent, is a cure of this Malady. Isidorus. Pliny saith, that when the Hart is olde, and preceiueth that his strength decayeth, his haire change, and his hornes drye aboue custome, that then for the renewing of his strength, he first deuoureth a Serpent, and afterward runneth to some Fountaine of wa∣ter and there drinketh, which causeth an alteration in the whole body; both changing the haire and horne: and the Writer of the Glosse vppon the 42. Psalme, which begin∣neth, Like as the Hart desireth the Water springes so longeth my soule after God ; confirmeth this opinion. Vincentius Belluacensis affirmeth, that Harts eate Serpents, for to cure the dimnesse of their eye-sight. But for the ending of this question, we must consider that there are two kinds of Harts; one which by the drawing forth of a Serpent out of her hole, The seuerall kinds of harts doth pre∣sently kill her by stamping hir vnder feet, this eateth that Serpent, and runneth to spring∣ing Water, after that he feeleth the poyson to make his body swell, and then by drinking doth vomit forth the poyson, and in the meane time looseth both haire and horne; yet the Monkes of Mesaen affirme, that the Hart thus poysoned doeth onely couer her body in the cold water and not drinke thereof, for that were exitiall vnto her, but she sen∣deth forth certaine teares, which are turned into a stone (called Bezahar ) of which shal be more said heereafter. The other kind of Harts when hee findeth a Serpent, killeth it, and doeth not eate it, and immediately after the victory returneth to feede in the Moun∣taines. Harts are opposed by Wolues, The enemy beastes to Harts. for many Wolues together doth ouercome a Hart and therefore it is but a fable of Strabo, that the Wolues and harts liue tame together in the Woodes of the Veneti. These kind of Wolues are called Thoes, and they especially feare these Wolues when they haue lost their hornes, and feede onely in the night season, Vincentius. which caused Ouid to write thus; Visa fugit nymphe: veluti perterrita fuluum, Cerua lupum, &c. They are afraid also of the first and second kinde of Eagles, for with their winges they raise much dust about the Harts, Albertus and then they being halfe blind, the Eagles pal out their eies, or else so beate their feathers about their faces, that they hinder their sight, and cause them to fall downe headlong from the Mountaines: Aristotle Of the feare of harts. they feare also the ganning of Foxes, and the Lynxes doe likewise lye in waite to hurt them. These are aboue al other fourefoo∣ted Beastes both ingenious and fearefull, who although they haue large hornes, yet their defence against other foure-footed Beastes is to runne away: For this cause, in auncient time a fugitiue Boy or seruant was called a Hart, and if he ran away twice, Cantharion, which Cantharion was a Spartan fugitiue, that first ran to the enemy, and afterward from them came backe againe to Sparta. C tus. Nebendi us And Martiall thus descibeth Alchaeus, who being o∣uercome by Phillip King of Macedon ran away like a Hart: Trux spiritus ille philippi, Ceruorum cursu praepete lapsus abit. The epithets of a Hart. The Epithets expressing the qualities of this Beast are many: as nimble, or agile, win∣ged, or swift-paced, ful of yeares, quick-footed, horned, wandering, fearefull, flying, fugitiue, A kind of au∣da ions harts Schneberg : light, wood-hunter, wilde, and liuely. There are of them very audations, for they will set vpon men as they trauaile through the Woods: and it is obserued, that the wrath∣full Hart hath few bunches on his horne, neither is it so long as others, but bunched at the roote, Pliny. yet all of them being pressed with dogs or other wilde beasts, will flye vnto a man for succor. It is reported by Phillip Melauchton, that in Locha (a towne of Saxony ) there was a Hart, which before rutting time would euery yeare leape ouer the Walles, and runne ouer rocks and Mountaines, The subtilty of a Hart, & their instruc∣tion and vse. and yet returne home againe, vntill the time that Duke Fredericke dyed, and then the Hart went forth but neuer returned againe. The male when he feeleth himselfe fat, liueth solitary and secret, because he knoweth the weight of his body will easi∣ly betray him to the hunters if he be hunted and pursued. The female commonly calueth neere the high wayes, of purpose to auoyde noysome beasts to her young one, who doe more auoide the sight of man then her selfe. Also it is reported, that Mithredates had a Bull, Aristotle a Horsse, and a Hart, for his guard beside men, who would not be bribed to suffer Traytors to kill him being a sleepe. Moreouer it is saide of Ptolaemeus Philadelphe, that ha∣uing a hinde calfe giuen vnto him, he brought it vp so familiarly tame, and accustomed it to words, Isidorus. The seuerall kinds of harts a secret a∣gainst poison Solinus that at length it seemed to vnderstand the Greeke language: And Aelianus af∣firmeth as much of the harts of India, for that language. When they are wounded with a Dart, and hauing gotten it out of their body by eating Dittany, they most carefully avoide the Sun-beames, least they shine vppon the greene wound, for then it will hardly be cured: but aboue al other arguments of their vndestan∣ding, none is more firme and euident, then their swimming; for the harts of Amanus, Li∣banus, Aelianus. and Carmell (Mountaines of Siria ) when they are to swim ouer the Sea, to the fruit∣full greene fieldes of Ciprus, they come downe to the Sea-shore, and there they tarry til they perceiue a prosperous Winde, and a calme Water; which happening, the Captaine or leader of them doth first of all enter into the Water, and so the next followeth, laying his head vpon the Captaines buttockes, Of the swim¦ming of harts T tzes Gillius. Oppianus. and so consequently all the residue resting their heads vpon the president. In the hindmost are the youngest and weakest, that so the violence of the flouds being broken by the stronger which goe before, the more infirme which follow may passe with lesse difficulty. Thus saile they along without star or compasse to direct them, except their owne sence of smelling, vsing their Legs for oares, and their broade hornes for sailes. And if the formost be weary, then slippeth he backe to rest his head vpon the hindmost, and so likewise the second and third, as they feele themselues enfeebled, vntill they arriue at the happy port of good pasture; where growing stronger like beastes fall to fighting for rule and gouernment, but when the combat doth shew the victor and strongest, Pliny Solinus. Their loue on musicke. the residue do euer after yeeld obedience to him. In like sort doe the Harts of Epirus swimme to Corcyra, and of Cilicia to the Island Curiadactes. They are deceiued with musicke, for they so loue that harmony, that they forbeare their foode to follow it. Also it is amazed at any strange sight, for if a hunter come be∣hinde a Horse or a Bullocke, laying ouer his backe his bowe and arrowes, they stand sta∣ring vpon the new-formed Beast, vntill the Dart do end their liues. Their rage in rutting time. At the time of their lust or rutting, they are aboue measure fierce, fighting naturally for the female, and sometimes wounding one another to death; and this falleth out most commonly in the latter end of August, at which time Arcturus riseth with the sunne, Solinus Oppianus. and then it is most naturall for the Hindes to conceiue. In some places in October their lust ariseth, and also in May; and then whereas at other times the Males liue apart from the Females, they goe about like lasciuious wooers, seeking the company of their femals, as it were at the Market of Venus. The Males in their raging desired lust, haue a peculiar voyce, Budaeus which the French call by a feigned word Reere, and the Germans Brulen, and the Latins tearm Rancere ; and the Beastes so affected Ololygones. When they find they Females, the are receiued with feare, then in short space one male will couer many females, continuing in this carnall appetite a month or two: their females doe sildome admit copulation, Their copu∣lation. Aristotle being heerein like vnto Cowes, by reason of the rigour of the males genitall: and therefore they sinke downe on their Buttockes when they feele the genitall seede, as it hath beene often obserued in tame Harts, and if they can the females runne away, the males striuing to holde them backe with their forefeete: but surely heerin they differ from all other: Aristotle it cannot wel be said that they are couered standing, lying, or going, (but rather running) for so are they filled with greatest celerity. When one month or sixe Weekes of their rutting is past, they grow tame againe, lay∣ing aside all fiercenesse and returne to their solitary places, digging euery one of them by himselfe a seuerall hole or Ditch, wherein they lie, to aswage the stronge sauour of their lust, for they stinke like Goates, and their face beginneth to Waxe blacker then at other times; and in those places they liue, vntill some shewers distill from the Cloudes; after which, they returne to their Pasture againe, and liue in flockes together as be∣fore. The female being thus filled, neuer keepeth company with the male againe vntill her burthen be deliuered, which is, eyght months; for so long doeth she beare her young: The chast y of hinds and the time they goe with young. Aristotle pliny. before her Caluing, she purgeth hir selfe by eating Seselis, or Siler of the Mountaine; and whereas she neuer purgeth vntill that time, then she emptieth hir selfe of pituitous and flegmatike humors. Then goe they to the places neere the high waies, and there they cast forth their calfe, (for the causes aforesaide) being more afraide of Wilde Beastes then men, whom she can auoide by flying: which when they haue seene, they goe and eate the Seselis aforesaide, and the skinne which commeth forth of their owne Wombe couering the young one, Cicero finding in it some notable medicine, which the Graecians cal Chorion, and not the herbe Arum, and this she doth before she lye downe to giue her young one sucke, (as Pliny af∣firmeth.) They bring forth but one, or very sildome twaine, which they lodge in a stable fit for them of their owne making, either in some rocke, or other bushye inaccessible place; Pliny. Aristotle co∣uering them, and if they be stubborne and wilde, beating them with their feete vntill they lye close and contented. Oftentimes she leadeth forth her young, teaching it to runne and leape ouer Bushes, stones, and small shrubs, against the time of danger; Aelianus. The manner how the hind educateth her calfe. Solinus. and so con∣tinueth all the Summer time, while their owne strength is most aboundant: but in the Winter time, they leaue and forsake them, bycause all Harts are feeble in the Wynter season. They liue very long, as by experience hath beene often mentioned; The time of their life. Aristotle Caelius Hesiodus. not only because they haue no gall (as the Dolphin hath none) but for other causes: also some affirme, that a Rauen will liue nine ages of a man, and a Hart foure ages of a Rauen: whereunto Virgill agreeth in these verses; Terbinis deciesque super exit in annos, Iusta senescentum quos implet vita virorum Hos nonies superat viuendo garrula cornix Et quater egreditur cornicis saecula ceruus Alipedum ceruum ter vincit cornus: at illum, multiplicat nouies Phaenix reperabilis ales: that is, As the life of a man is threescore and sixe, so a Rauen doth liue nine times so many years (Viz:) 528. yeares. The Hart liueth foure times the age of the Rauen (Viz:) 112. yeares. The Crow exceedeth the Hart three times (:Viz) 6336. but the Phoenix which is repayred by her owne ashes, surmounteth the Crow nine times, and so liueth 57524. yeares. The which I haue set downe (not for truth) but for report, leauing euery reader to the chiefest matter of credit, as in his owne descretion he conceiueth most proba∣ble. But it is confessed of all, that Harts liue a very long life: for Pliny affirmeth, that an hundred yeares after the death of Alexander Magnus, there were certain taken aliue which had about their Neckes Golden Collars, A history Solinus with an inscription that they were put on by Alexander. In Calabria (once called Iapygia and Peucetia ) there was a coller taken off from the necke of a Hart by Agathocles King of Sicily, Aristotle which was couered with the flesh & fat of the Hart; and there was writen vpon it, Diomedes Dianae : whereby it was coniectured, that it was put on by him before the siege of Troy : for which cause, the King brought the same and did offer it vp in the Temple of Iupiter. The like was in Arcadia, when Arcesilaus dwelt in Lycosura ; for he confidently affirmed, that he saw an old sacred Hind, Pausanius. which was dedicated to Diana, hauing this inscription in hir Coller: Nebros eoon ealoon ota es Ilcon en Agapenor. When Agapenor was in Troy, then was I a young calfe taken. By which it appeareth, that a Hart liueth longer then an Elephant, for indeede as they liue long before they grow to any perfection, their youth and weak∣nesse cleauing fast vnto them, Columello so is it giuen to them to haue a longer life, for continuance in ripenesse and strength of yeares. Solinus. The sicknes of Harts These Beastes are neuer annoyed with feuers, because their flesh allayeth all aduenti∣tiall and extraordinary heate. If he eate Spiders he instantly dyeth thereof, except he eate also Wilde Iuy or Sea-crabs. Likewise, Nauew-gentill and Oleander, kill the Hart. When a Hart is in his chase, Gillius. Lullius Aristotle. pliny. he is greatly pained in his bowels, by reason that the skynne wherein they lie is very thin and weake, and apt to be broken with any smal stroke; and for this cause he often stayeth to ease himselfe. There is a kind of thorne called cactus, wherewithall if a young one be pricked in his legs, his bones will neuer make Pipes: Besides, these Beastes are annoyed with Scabs and yt∣ches in their head and skinne, termed by the French by a peculiar name ( Froyer ) I wil not stand vpon the idle conceite of Albertus, that waspes and Emmets breed in the heades of Harts, Bl dus The vse of the seuerall parts. for he mistaketh them for the wormes before mentioned. The skinnes of this beast are vsed for garments in some Countries, and in most pla∣ces for the bottoms of Cushions, and therefore they chase such as are killed in the sum∣mer time, when they are fat and most spotted; and the same hauing their haire pulled from them, are vsed for Breeches, Buskins, and gloues. Likewise Pliny and Sextus af∣firmed, Hesichius Ʋarianus that if a man sleepe on the ground hauing vppon him a Harts skinne, Serpents neuer anoy him: wherof Serenus mado this verse: Aut tu ceruina per nocttem in pelle qui∣escis : and the bones of young ones are applied for making of Pipes. It is reported, that the blood of Harts burned together with herbe-dragon, or chanes, orgament, and mastick haue the same power to draw Serpents out of their holes, which the Harts haue be∣ing aliue: and if there be put vnto it wilde Pellitory, it will also distract and dissipate them againe. The marrow of a Hart hath the same power against Serpents, by oynment or perfu∣med vpon coales; and Nicander prescribeth a certaine oynment to be made of the flesh of Serpents, Dioscorides of the marrow of a Hart, and Oyles of Roses, against the bitings of Serpents. The fat of a Hart hath the like effects that the marrow hath. Achilles that Noble souldier, was said neuer to haue tasted of Milke, but to be nourished with the marrow of Harts, by Chiro, as is affirmed by Varinus and Etymologus. The like operation hath the tooth (as Se∣renus saith) Aut genere ex ipso dentem portabtis amicum : If the the seede of a young Hinde-calfe, be drunke with veniger, it suffereth no poyson of Serpentes to enter into the body that day. The perfume of the horne driueth away Serpents and noysome flyes, especially from the young Calues, or from horses if Womens haire be added thereunto, Aclianus. Ʋarro. Palladius Rasis. Gillius Pliny. Solinus. Albertus Cardanus. with the hoofe of the Hart. And if men drinke in pots wherein are wrought Harts hornes, it will weaken all force of venom. The Magicians haue also deuised, that if the fat of a Dragons hart be bound vp in the skinne of a Roe, with the Nerues of a Hart, it promiseth victory to him that beareth it on his shoulder, and that if the teeth be so bound in a Roes skinne, it ma∣keth ones Maister, Lord, or all superior powers, exorable and appeased toward their seruants and suitors. Orpheus in his booke of stones, commaundeth a husband to carry a∣bout him a Harts horne, if he will liue in amity and concord with his wife: to conclude, they also adde another figment to make men inuincible. The head and taile of a Dragon, with the haires of a Lyon taken from betweene the browes, and his marrow, the froath or white-mouth of a victorious Horse, the nailes of a Dogge, and the Nerues of a Hart and a Roe, bound vp altogether in a Harts skin: and this is as true as the wagging of a Dogges taile doth signifie a tempest. To leaue these tri∣fles scarce worthy to be rehearsed, but onely to shew the vanity of men, giuen ouer to lying deuises; let vs come to the other naturall and medicinall properties not as yet touched. The flesh of these Beastes in their rutting time smelleth strongly like a Goats, The vse and benefit of th flesh. the which thing is by Blondus attributed also to the flesh of the females with young, I know not how truely; but I am sure that I haue knowne certaine Noble women, which euery morning did eate this flesh, and during the time they did so, they neuer were troubled with Ague: and this vertue they holde the stronger, if the Beast in dying, haue receiued but one wound. The flesh is tender, especially if the beast were libbed before his hornes grew: Pliny Solinus. lib 3. de alim: yet is not the iuyce of that flesh very wholesome, and therefore Galen aduiseth men to abstaine as much from Harts flesh, as from Asses, for it engendereth melancholy, yet is it better in Summer then in Winter. Simeon Sethi speaking of the whot Countries, forbiddeth to eate them in Summer, because then they eate Serpents and so are venemous; which fal∣leth not out in colder Nations, and therefore assigneth them rather to be eaten in Winter time, because the concoctiue powers are more stronger through plenty of inward heate, but withall admonisheth, that no man vse to eate much of them, for it will breede palsies and trembling in mans body, begetting grosse humors, which stop the Melt and Lyuer: and Auicenne proueth, that by eating heereof men incur the quartane Ague; wherefore it is good to pouder them with salt before the dressing, and then seasoned with pepper & other things, knowne to euery ordinary cooke and woman, they make of them pasties in most nations. The Hart and braine of a hare or Cony haue the power of triacle for expelling of e∣uill humors, but the liuer is intollerable in foode: the hornes being young are meate for Princes, especially because they auoide poyson. It was a cruell thing of King Ferdinand, that caused the young ones to be cut out of the Dams belly and baked in pastils, for his Li∣quorous Epicureall appetite. The whole nature and disposition of euery part of this beast, is against poison and ve∣nemous things (as before recited. The medi∣cines of a Hart and his seueral parts. Pliny Dioscorides, Solinus ) His blood stayeth the loosenesse of the belly and all fluxes, especially fryed with oyle, and the inferior parts annoynted therewith, and being drunke in Wine it is good against poysoned woundes, and all intoxications. The marrow of this beast is most approueable aboue other, and is vsed for sweete o∣dour, against the gout, and heate of men in consumptions, and all outward paines and weakenesse, as Serenus comprised in one sentence saying: Et ceruina potest mulcere medulla rigorem, frigoris. Likewise the fat and marrowe, mollifieth or disperseth all bunches in the flesh and olde swellings; all vlcers except in the shinnes and legges, and with Venus-nauill the Fistula, mattery vlcers in the eares with Rozen, Pitch, Goose-greace, and Goat-sewet, the clea∣uing of the lips: and with Calues sewet the heate and paine in the mouth and iawes. It hath also vertue being drunke in warme water, to aswage the paine in the bowels and small guts, or bloody flixe. Sextus The gall of a Bull, Oyle of bayes, Butter, and this marrow, by annoynting, cureth paine in the knees and loynes and other euils in the seate of a man, in the hipps, and in the belly when it is costiue: It procureth flowers of Women, cureth the goute, pimples in ones face, and ringwormes. Absyrtus prescribeth it to be giuen in sweete Wine with waxe, vnto a horse for an old cough proceeding of cold, after purging and heating, by hold∣ing the Horsses tounge in ones hand while the medicine is thrust downe his throat. The same in sheeps Milke with rubricke and soft Pitch, drunke euery day or eaten to your meate, helpeth the ptisicke, and obstructions. Anatolius approued, beane meale sifted and sod with Harts marrow to be giuen to a horse which stalleth blood, Marcellus for three daies together. Also mingled with the poulder of Oyster-shels, it cureth kibes and chil∣blanes. A woman perfumed with the haires of this beast, is preserued from abortements; and the same perfume helpeth the difficulty of vrine, and little pieces cut off from the hide with a pummise put in wine, and rubbing the body, helpeth the holy-fire. The pouder of the bones burned, is an antidote against the falling euill▪ and the dispersing of the melt; and the bones beaten to poulder, stayeth the fluxe of the belly. It were endlesse to describe al the vertues ascribed to the horne; and therefore I will content my selfe with the recital of few. Pliny and Solinus preferre the right horne, Aristo∣tle the left, and the spires or tops are more medicinable then the hard and solide stemme, but the hornes found in the Woodes lost by the beastes and growne light are good for nothing. The other haue their vses both raw and burned, which may be these that fol∣low. Take the horne and cut it into smal pieces, then put it into an earthen pot annoyn∣ted within with durt, and so set it in a furnace vntill it become White, then wash it like a minerall and it will helpe the runnings and vlcers in the eies: and the same also keepeth the teeth white, and the gums sound. The young hornes while they be soft being eaten, are an antidote against henbane, and other poysonfull herbes. The right horne hid by the Hart in the earth is good against the poyson of Toades. Pliny. The Harts horne hath po∣wer to dry vp all humors, Sextus and therefore it is vsed in eie salues: and Orpheus promiseth to a bald man haire on his head againe, if he annoynt it with oyle and poulder of this horne: likewise the same with the seede of blacke mirtle, Marcellus Butter and Oyle, restraineth the falling away of the haire being annoynted vpon the head after it is newly shauen: with vi∣neger it killeth ringwormes. Sextus The same burned in the sunne, and afterward the face being rubbed and washed therwith thrice together, taketh away pimples-spots out of the face: the poulder drunke in wine or annoynted on the head killeth lice and nits: the same with vineger, Marcellus wine, or oyle of roses, annoynted vpon the forehead, easeth the head-ache if it proceede of cold. Galenus A perfume made of this horne with Castoreum, and lime, or Brimstone, causeth a dead child strangled in his mothers wombe to come forth; If the horne be taken raw and rub∣bed vpon the gums, keepeth the cheekes from all annoyance of the tooth-ache, and faste∣neth the loose teeth, as Sereneus said: Quod vero assumpsit nomen de dente fricando Ceruino ex cornu cinis est. Galen prescribeth the poulder of this horne for the Iaundise, and for him that spitteth bloody matter, and to stay vomit being taken in a reere Egge. It comforteth also a rheu∣matike stomach, and it is tryed to cure the Kinges euill: it pacifieth the melt, dryeth the Spleene, driueth all kind of Wormes out of the belly, being drunke with Hony, and ea∣seth the chollyck, expelleth away mothes, helpeth the strangury, & the paine in the blad∣der, staieth fluxes in women both whit and red: being mingled with barly meale, water, & twigs of Cedar : beside many other such properties. The teares of this beast after she hath beene hunted with a Serpent, are turned into a a stone (called Belzahard, or Bezahar ) of which we haue spoken before: and being thus transubstantiated doe cure all manner of venom (as Auenzoar, and Cardinall Ponzetti affirme) after many trials, and Serenus also expresseth in this distichon: Seminecis cerut lachryman miscere liquori Conuenit, atque artus illine miscere calentes. The liuer of this beast helpeth all sores in the feete, being worne in the shooes, the same dried to pouder with the throat or wind-pipe of the beast, and mingled with Hony, and so eaten helpeth the Cough, Ptisicke, sighing, and short breathing. Pliny and Sextus af∣firme, that when a Hind perceiueth her selfe to be with young, she deuoureth or eateth vp a certaine stone, which is afterward found either in her excrements or ventricle, and is profitable for all Women with childe and in trauell, for by that onely fact, the Hinde is most speedily deliuered without great paine, and sildome or neuer suffering abortment; and there is also a little bone found in the heart of euery one of these beastes, which per∣formeth the same qualities, instead whereof they haue such a thinge to sell at Venice, Aetuis. hol∣ding it at a great price: but Brasauola affirmeth, that he opened the hearts of two Harts, and found in them a little gristle not much vnlike to a crosse, whereof the one being of a Beast new killed, was very soft, but the other was much harder, because the beast was slain about six daies before. This bone is in the left side of the Hart, vpon which, the Spleene moueth and sendeth forth her excrements by vapours, which by reason of their drines are there turned into a bone, and being firste of all of the substaunce of the Hartes bloode; and it is good against the trembling of the Hart, and the Haemorrhoides, but this bone cannot bee found in any, except he be killed betwixt the middle of August and the twelfth of Sep∣tember.

The skinny seed of the hind-Calfe, is aboue all other commended against poison, and the bitings of Serpents and of mad Dogges; likewise it stayeth al fluxes of blood, and spit∣ting of blood, and egestion of blood: & it being eaten with Beets and Lentils, is profita∣ble against the paine of the belly. The genitall part and stones, are wholsome (being taken in wine) against all bitings of Vipers, Adders, and Snakes, and the same vertue hath the na∣turall seed supped vp in a rere Egge. The genitall hath also a vertue to encrease lust in euery creature, it being either dryed and drunke; or else bounde fast to their priuy parts. Likewise being washed in water, and afterward dried to pouder, and so drunk, helpeth the chollick, and the difficulty of making water, if you put it into a little Triacle. The dung of Harts cureth the dropsie, especially of a Subulon or young Hart: the v∣rine easeth the paine in the Spleene, the wind in the ventricle and bowels, and infvsed in∣to the eares, healeth their vlcers. In the tip of the taile lieth poyson, which being drunke, causeth extasie and death, if it be not holpe by a vomit made of Butter, Annise, and oyle of Sesamine, or as Cardinall Ponzettus saith, that the Harts eie is an Antidote to this euill: It may be knowne by a yellowish-greene-colour, and therefore it is called the gall, for nature hath appointed that place to receiue all the venome of the whole Bo∣die. Of the hun∣ting and ta∣king these beasts. I should heere end the discourse of this beast, after the method already obserued in the precedents: but seeing the manner of the taking heereof (being a sport for princes) hath yet bin touched but very little, it shall not be tedious vnto me, to abstaine from the ne∣cessary relation of the subsequent stories, for the delightfull narration of the hunting of the Hart: to the end that as the former treatise hath but taught how to know a Birde in a bush, that which insueth may declare the seueral waies of catching and bringing the same to hand. This is a beast standing amazed at euery strange sight, euen at the hunters bow and Ar∣rowe, comming behind a stalking Horsse (as is already declared▪) and moreouer, like as the Roes are deceiued by the hissing of a leafe in the mouth of the hunter, so also is this Beast, for while she harkeneth to a straunge noyse, imitating the cry of a Hind-Calfe, and proceeding from one man, shee receiueth a deadly stroke by the other: so also if they heare any musicall pipings, they stand still to their owne destruction: for which cause the Egyptians decipher a man ouerthrowne by slattery, by painting a Hart taken by musick: and Varro relateth vpon his own knowledge, Horus. A hi ogli∣ ll em∣blem. that when he supped in his Lordship bought of M. Piso, the Pastour or Forrester after supper, tooke but a Harpe in his hande, and at the sound thereof, at innumerable flocke of Harts, Boares, and other fourefooted beasts came about their Cabanet, being drawne thither onely by the Musicke; insomuch as he thought he had beene in the Romane Circus or Theater, beholding the playing spectacles of all the Affrican beasts, when the aedilian Officers haue their huntings: The like is also reported by Aelianus, sauing that he addeth, that no toyle or engine is so assured or vna∣uoidable to draw these beasts within a laborinth as is musicke, whereby the Hunter get∣teth as it were the Hart by the eare, for if through attention he hold downe his eares as he doth in musicke, he distrusteth no harme, but if once he prick vp his eares as he common∣ly doth, being chased by men and dogges, an infinite labour will not be sufficient to ouer take and compasse him. Aelianus. It is reported that they are much terified with the sight of red fea∣thers, which thing is affirmed by Ausonius in these verses: An cum fratre vagos dumeta perauia ceruos Circundas maculis, & multa indagine pennae. And Ouid also saying: N c formidatis ceruos includite pennis. And Lucan also: —Sic dum pauidos formidine ceruos Claudat odoratae metuentes aera pennae. Of which thing the Hunters make an aduantage, for when they haue found the beast, they set their nettes where they imagine the beast will flie, and then one of them sheweth to the beast on the other side, Zenophon the red feathers hanging on a rope, which scarreth them in hast into the Hunters nettes, as S. Ierom testifieth in one of his dialogues saying: Et pa∣uidorum more ceruorum, dum vanos pennarum euitatis volatus fortissimis retibus implicamini. And you sayth he (speaking to the Luceferian heretickes) runne away from the vaine sha∣king of feathers, like the fearefull Harts, while in the meane time you are inclapsed in vn∣auoidable and inextricable nets. And this caused Seneca to write, that the babe feareth a shadow, Vmbria me∣taiter ab in∣faucibus a fe¦ris rubeus penna. and wilde beasts a red feather. Many times the young Calfe is the cause of the taking of his damme: for the Hunter early in the morning before day light, watcheth the Hinde where shee layeth her young one, vntill she goe and refresh her selfe with pasture; when he hath seene this, then doeth he let loose his Dogs, and maketh to the place where the Hinde Calfe was lefte by his mo∣ther. The seely Calfe lyeth immoueable as if hee were fastened to the earth, and so neuer stirring, but bleating and braying suffereth himselfe to bee taken, except there be rainie weather, for the impatience of colde and wette will cause him to shift for himselfe: which if it fall out, the Dogges are at hand to ouertake him, and so being taken is committed to the keeper of the nettes. The Hinde both hearing & seeing the thr ldome of her pore sonne, commeth to re∣lieue him without dread of hounde or Hunter, but all in vaine, for with his darte hee also possesseth himselfe of her▪ but if the Calfe be greater and so bee able to runne with the damme among the heardes, they are most hard to be taken, for in that age they runne ve∣ry fast, and the feare of Dogges increaseth their agilitie, insomuch as to take them among the heards is impossible euery one fighting for them. But the only way is to single one out of them from the flock and so follow him vntill he be weary, for although he be very nimble, yet by reason of his tender age, his limbes are not able to continue long. The elder Harts are t ken in snares and gins laid in ditches and couered with leaues, whereby the feet of this beast are snared in wood; this kind is de∣described by Zenophon and Pollux, and is called in Greeke Podestrabe, in Latine Pedica, of which also the Poets make mention, as Virgil: Tunc gruibus pedicas & retia ponere ceruis. And this kind is better described by Gratius, with whose wordes I will passe it ouer as a thing out of vse. Nam fuit & laqueis aliquis curracibus vsus. Ceruin issere magis conterere neruo Quidque dentatas iligno robere clausit: Saepe habet imprudens alieni lucra laboris Fra tegit insidias habitu mentita ferino Venator pedicas, tu dissimulantibus armis. Their manner is when they are chased with Dogges to runne away with speed, yet often∣times stand stil and looke backe, not onely to harken to the hunter, but also to rest them∣selues, for in their chase they are euer troubled in their belly (as is before declared,) and sometime they grow so weary, that they stand still, and are pierced with arrowes, some∣times they runne till they fall downe dead, sometime they take themselues to the water and so are refreshed, or else to auoide the teeth of Dogs, they forsake the drye land, and perish in the floods, or else by that meanes escape scotfree: wherefore it must be regar∣ded by euery good hunter to keepe him from the waters, either among the woods, or o∣ther rough places. But heerin the subtility of this beast appeareth, Albertus. that when he is hunted he runneth for the most part to the high waies, that so the sauour of his steps may be put out by the trea∣dings of men, and he auoid the prosecution of the Hound. Their swiftnes is so great, that in the Champaigne and plaine fields they regard not Dogges, for which cause in Fraunce they poyson Arrowes with an hearbe called Zenicum or Toca, and it is a kinde of Aconite or Wolfe-bane, which hath power to corrupt and destroy agility of body, and to stay ce∣lerity, and for their hunting in France by Dogs, it is most excellently described by Budae∣us and Robertus Stephanus in his French dictionary. This wild, deceitfull and subtill beast, (say they) by windings and turnings do often de∣ceiue their hunter, as the Harts of Meandros flying frō the terrible cry of Dianaes hounds, wherefore the prudent hunter must frame his Dogges, as Pithagoras did his Schollers, ( Lu ers qui ne parlent point ) with words of Art, to set them on, and take them off againe at his pleasure; wherefore he must first of all compasse in the beast, ( En son giste ) in her own lodging, and so raise her vp in the fight of the dogs, that so they may neuer loose her footing. Neither must they set vppon euery one, either of the heard, or that wandereth solitary alone, nor yet a little one, but partly by aspect or sight, and partly by their footings in the soft earth, and also by their dung ( Les fumees ) they iudge of their game, for a good wood∣man must not sticke to gather vp the Deeres excrement or soile, and keepe them ( la trom∣pe ) in his hunting horne: such things must the kinges huntsmen and forresters obserue, as also the quantity of his bed or lodging when they find it, being thus informed of their game then ( Discoupler les chieus ) they take off their Dogge couplings, and some on hors∣back, other on foot follow the cry with greatest art, obseruation, and speed, remembring and preuenting ( Cerf ruze ) the subtile turninges, and headinges, of the Hart, straining with all dexterity to leape hedge, pale, ditch, and rocks; neither fearing thornes, woods, downe-hils, but prouiding a fresh horsse in case their first tire, ( Cheuaux de relatis ) and leaping on him with speede, vntill he see ( vn grand cerf l'escuyer du grand cerf ) the great Hart hauing ten speeres on his hornes, and his little squier-hart to attend him, which the Dogs once perceiuing, onely follow the great Hart, taking for a prohibition to followe anio other. The Dogges are animated by the winding of horns, and voices of the hunters, like sol∣diours to a battell by the voice of a trumpet and other instruments: but sometimes the crafty great beast sendeth forth his little squire to be sacrificed to the Dogs and hunters instead of himselfe, lying close in the meane time, then must the retreat be sounded, and ( Rompre le chieus ) the dogs be broken off and taken in ( Le limter ) that is, leame againe vn∣till they be brought to the fairer game, who ariseth in feare and rage, betaking himselfe to his surest legges, being pursued with all the cries of hunters, ringing and ecchoing betwixt heauen and earth, dismaying him with the continuall noyse in his eares, no lesse dreadefull and fearefull then the voyce of a passing bell to a sicke man, or the sight of the executioner to a condemned caitife, yet still he striueth vntill wearied and breathlesse, he be forced to offer vp his blood and flesh to the rage of al the obseruant pedissequants of the hunting goddesse Diana. The vulgar sort call an olde Hart a subtile and cunning Beast, but the nobles call him ( cerf sage ) a wise Hart, who to auoide all his enemies runneth into the greatest heards, and so bringeth a cloud of error vpon the Dogges, to keepe them from any further pro∣secution: Sometime also beating of some of the heard into his owne footsteps, that so he may more easily escape and procure a laborinth to the Dogges, and then after a little while he betaketh himselfe to his heeles againe, running still with the wind, not onely for refrigeration, but because he may the more easily heare the voice of his pursuers, whe∣ther they be far or neere. At last, being (for all this) found out againe by the obseruance of the hunters, and skill of the Dogges, he flyeth into the heardes of Cattell, as Kye, Oxen, or Sheepe, leaping vpon an Oxe, and laying his body or the fore-part thereof vpon him, as a ryder vpon a Horsse, that so touching the earth onely with his hinder hoofes, to leaue a very small or no sent at all behind for the Hounds to discerne. The chiefe huntsman or seargeant of the houndes vnto Lewes the twelfth, called ( lo grand veneur ) affirmed, that on a time they hauing a Hart in chase, suddenly the houndes fell at a fault, so as the beast was out of sight, and not a Dog would once stirre his foote; whereat all the hunters were amazed, like as in some iugling Appollonian trick, as though the hart had cleane forsaken the earth, and with the wings of some foule had bene flewne away; or as if the earth had opened her mouth to receiue him into her protection, and had closed againe ouer her heade, or else some Witchcraft had cast a miste before the Dogges and hunters eyes: At last by casting about (as it is vsuall in such cases) they founde the fraud of the horned beast, which is worth the memory. There was a great whit-thorne which grew in a shadowie steepe place as high as a tree, and was inuironed with other small shrubs about it, into the which the said hart leapt, and there stood aloft the boughes spreading from one another, and there he remained, whe∣ther because he could not get off againe, or else for that he was stifled in that place, but surely he was there thrust thorough and so dyed, and so had they all rather perish anye other way then by the teeth and tearing in pieces of angry and greedy Hounds. Yet their maner is, that when they see themselues euery where intercepted, to make force at him with their hornes that commeth first vnto him, except he be preuented by some sword or speare; which being done, the hunter with his horn soundeth the fal of the beast, and then euery one approcheth, luring with triumph for such a conquest, of whom the skilfullest openeth the beast, giuing vnto the hounds such parts as belongeth to them, for their incouragement against another time; and for that purpose the hunters dippe bread in the skinne and blood of the beast, to giue vnto the hounds their ful satisfaction: and many such other things may the reader desirous of this knowledge finde in the Au∣thors aforesaide, to whome I will commende him rather, then spend more time in this busines, better manifested by experience, then by any written document, yet I woulde wish men to be sparing in this exercise, seeing it hath beene sildome found that a man gi∣uen to hunting, but he perished in his pleasure as Actaeon did by his owne Dogges: and therefore Alciatus doth fitly compare togither hunters and receiuers of theeus and rob∣bers, calling them new Actaeons; who after they had receiued horns, must be destroyed by their owne Dogges which they haue nourished. The best vse of these beastes is to keep them tame as in Heluetia, where they hunt seldom, and to make good vse of them for no∣rishment rather then for sport, as it is reported of a holy man, who kept a hind so famili∣ar with him▪ that in the wildernes he liued vpon her milke. Concluding this discourse with the words of the poet, for the instruction of Dogs to this pastime and the practise of the beasts. Veloces Spartae catulos, acremque molossum, Pasce sero pingui &c. And againe. montesque peraltos Ingentem clamore premes ad retia ceruum. Confertoque agmine cerui Torpent mole noua, & summis vix cornibus extant.

Comminus obtruncant ferro, grauiter que tudentes Caedunt, & magno laeti clamore reportant. Of the Dyctyes. H Erodotus in his fourth book affirmeth, that among the Affrican Shepherds towarde the East, there are bredde in Bassaria Hystriches wilde Rammes, Thoes and Dyctyes, of which last there is not any mention among all other writers, except in Varinus and Hesychius, who affirme that among the Lace∣demonians a Glead or Kite was called Dyctis, but this spoken of Herodotus I coniecture to be some four-footed beast, being led with no other reason then that the other with whom he placeth it, are generaly known to be creaturs of that kind and nature: wherefore I thought good to expresse the name of it in this place, desiring the reader to accept so much thereof as is already knowne, and to search farther for the description of it, at the handes of them who are eie-witnesses of the wonders of Affrica. OF THE DOGGE In generall. A Dogge is called in Haebrew Keleb, and Lamas according to Munster : in Caldee Kalba ; in Arabique Kalbe, in Persia Sag ; The name & deriration thereof. The Saracens Kep or Kolph : the Graecians Kuon because of his loue to man, and vulgarly at this day Skilos and Skule : the Medians Spaco, the Germanes Hund, the Italians Cane ; The French Chien, the Spaniardes Perro or cauendo, because his barking is as lowd as an Artificiall song; also Catellus, the Il∣lyrians Pes or Pas, and the Latines Canis. There is no region or countrey in the world, The coūtries and diuersi∣ties of Dogs. where these are not bred in some store, as shall be declared afterwarde in the particular discourse of euery kind of Dogges. For as shall be manifested more at large, there are Dogges very great, some for hunting, some for Warre and defence, some for the Bore, Bull, or Bear, some for the Hare, Cony, or Hedge-hog: againe some are smal∣ler which are called Hounds, Braches, Beagles, Shepheardes Dogges, House-curres, Spagnels both for the Water and Land: and some foysting Dogges for the pleasure of the rich. In the first place there are to be handled the nature of Dogges in generall, The general nature of dogs. wherein they agree, and their common properties of nature, such as are not destroyed in the de∣stinction of kindes, but remaine like infallible and invariable truths in euery kinde and country of the world. To begin with that which is outward, it is to be obserued that Dogs are generally rough, Their out∣ward parts. Aristotle Albertus A secret in the braine. and their haire indifferently long (which in winter they loose euery yeare) is a signe of a good constitution; but if it grow ouer long, the mangie scab will fol∣low: the outward proportion of the head altereth as the kind altereth, being sometime like a Lyon, sometime like a Hedge-hog, some long with a broad snowt, and sometime with a piked snowt, but the braine decreaseth and increaseth with the moon, there is no com∣missure or seame in his scull (like as is in a mans) but it is a continued bone without sepe∣ration inward or out-ward. The best Dogs haue flat Nostrils, yet round, solide, and blunt, the mouth is long and slit, their teeth like saws, as it is in fishes and Serpents: those which are cald Canyne before, Pliny. are only changed, as it also falleth out in a Lyon, & these they loose or change both males and females in the fourth moneth of their age: about which time, they haue new ones come forth to thrust off their old, by their teeth is their age discerned, for while they are white and sharpe, it assureth the youth of a Dogge, but when they grow blackish or dus∣ky, they betoken the elder age. Aristotle. Pliny. The breast of a Dogge is narrow and piked, his ventricle small and narrow, for which cause he neuer easeth his bodily excrements without paine, his bowels are like a Lyons: He hath a long spleene like a man, and a Hogge: his yard and stones hange outward be∣tweene his hinder legges, a base natured curre striketh his taile betwixt his legges, his fore-legges bend like the armes of a man, and he vseth them in stead of Armes, hauing fiue distinct fingers, Aristotle. Blondus. Pliny. commonly called clawes vpon each foote before, and foure vpon each foot behind, which also haue straight nailes vpon them, and that which hangeth higher vpon the leg is crooked. The parts of a female dog The females, because they bring forth many whelpes at a time, haue vnderneath their bellies great paps, with many speanes to sucke at, in a double ranke or row on both sides, and the generous bitches haue xii. other but x: They beare their young within their belly next to the midriffe, their fime is dry like a wolfes, & therby his temperament is known to be hot and dry, considered in it selfe, but compared with others it varieth, for to a mans, it is dry; Galen. to an Emmets, it is moist: Againe, in respect of a man it is hot, in respect of a Lyon it is cold. The voice of Dogges. Pliny. The louder and shriller voice of a Dogge, is called barking, the lower and stiller, is cal∣led whining, or fawning: It was a monstrous thing, that a Dogge should speake, and a ser∣pent barke, as it is beleeued in antiquity both came to passe, when Tarquinius was driuen out of his kingdome. It is not causelesse that the barking of Dogges, hath attributed vnto it diuers qualities, as for a man to dreame of the same, presageth some treasonable harme by enemies, Arremidorus so likewise if they fawne and claw vpon a man. Among the precedent tokens of Caesars death, they set downe in certaine verses, the howling voices of Owles, the weeping drops of the Iuory tree, & the continuall barkings of Dogges, as followeth: Tristia nulle lotis stygius dedit omnia bubo. mille locis lachrymauit ebur. Inque foro circunque domos & templa deorum Nocturno vl lasse canes ferunt: &c. The Egyptians signifie these thinges by a Dog, a Scribe, a Prophet, a splene, smelling, lau∣ghing, and neezing. A Scribe, because as the Dog is silent more then he barketh, O us. Emblemati∣call descrip∣tions. so must a perfect Scribe meditate more then he speaketh: for to barke at euery one were to plea∣sure none, and to speake continually, were a signe of madnes: Againe, a Prophet because a Dogge doth most eagerly behold, and admire constantly all holy actions, and so ought the eies and eares of a Prophet be attendant vpon heauenly things. The Spleene because a Dogge hath little or no spleene, and thereof commeth his madnes and death; whereof also it commeth that the seruants which haue the charge of Dogges, being with them in their sicknes and latter end, for the most part prooue splenaticke. Smelling, neezing, and Laughing, because the spleenaticke can doe none of all these, but of this more after∣ward. The voice of a Dogge, is by the learned, interpreted a rayling and angry speech: wher∣of commeth that Canina facundia among Authors, for rayling eloquence. It is the na∣ture of a Dogge when he maketh water, to holde vp his legge, if he be aboue six moneths old, or haue bene at procreation, the females doe it for the most part sitting, The making of vrine. Aristotle. Pliny. yet some of the genereous spirits do also hold vp their legges. They euer smell to the hinder partes of one another, peraduenture thereby, they discerne their seuerall kind and disposition of each other in their owne natures: After they haue ran a course, Albertus The factions of Dogs for their owne ease. they releeue themselues by tumbling and rowling too and fro: when they lie downe they turne round in a circle, two or three times togither, which they do for no other cause, but that they may the more commodiously lie round, and from the wind. They sleepe as doth a man, and therein dreame very often, The sleep of Dogges. as may appeare by their of∣ten barking in their sleepe: but it must be diligently regarded of them that loue to keepe Dogges, that they permit them not to sleepe much, especially after their meat when they are young, for as they are very whot, so in their sleepe doth their heate draw much paine into their stomach and ventrickle. The time of their copulation is for the most part at a yeare old, yet the females will lust after it at eight months old, Their copula¦tion and ly∣ming Columella howbeit they are not to be suffered, because it weakeneth their bodies, and dulleth in them all generosity: therefore, after one yeare they may safely be suffered to come together, and not before: Neither is it materiall, whether in Summer or Winter, but it is best in the beginning of the spring, but with this caution, that Whelpes of a litter or of one and the same Bitch, be neuer suffered to couple; for nature reioyseth more in variety. For then they grow salt and begin to be proud; yet in ancient time, Aristotle for the more enno∣bling of their race of Dogges, they did not suffer them to engender till the Male were foure yeare old, and the female three: for then would the Whelpes prooue more stronge and liuely. By hunting, labour, and trauaile, the males are made more fit for generation, and they prooue best which haue their sires of equall age. They are not suffered to engen∣der all their life longe, but vntill ten and twelue yeare old, or rather eight in the male and sixe in the female. Yet there haue beene founde which in one and other sexe, Tardinus haue con∣tinued in procreation till they were twentye yeare olde, but this exceeded▪ all naturall rea∣son. When they begin to be proud if you giue them leauen mingled with milke and salt, they will not straye and range abroade: at the time of their copulation, they cleaue to∣gither for a certaine space as if theyr hinder partes were glewed, The time of a Bitches whelping & bearing her young. Aristotle and so they are filled at one time. They beare their young the fifth part of the yeare, that is about two monthes and odde daies, but this reconing is not generall, for some kinds beare their young three monthes, and some more. They bring forth many at a time sometime fiue, seuen, nine, or twelue; for so many celles hath the female in her wombe. Albertus relateth that he saw a Bitch of the Mastiue kind, which brought forth at three litters fifty Whelpes, that is nineteene at the first, eighteene at the second, and thirteene at the third: but somtime she bringeth forth but one, which is a good argument to proue that she is filled at the first lyming. They are purged of their mensturous fluxes seauen or foureteene daies before they grow proud, and againe, at their time of littering; at other times they suffer none. The first they cast forth of their Wombe is commonly a Male, which resembleth the father, Aristotle The h st is a male. the other Males and females as it happeneth, (but it is accounted a prodigious thing to litter all males or all females) wherein nature yeeldeth an excellent argument of diuine prouidence, for the first borne of all kindes hath more resemblance of the fa∣ther then of the mother. They are also Whelped blind, and so remaine for nine or ten dayes, The blindnes of Whelpes. bycause through their multitude they cannot bee perfected in the Dammes Bellye, which doeth not happen to Beastes which beare single, as sheepe and Goates. They vse to carry them vp and downe in their mouthes till they be seuen dayes old but not afterward, they haue milke about fiue daies before theyr littering. It is not good to preserue the first or second litter, but the third: and after they haue littered it is good to giue the Bitch Whay and Barly bread, for that will comfort her and encrease her milke; and in some places they take Goates milke and seeth in it broken bones of meate, where∣by they conceiue that the Damme and Whelpes are much battered for that nutriment: there is not any great regard of the nourishment of Dogges, for they will eate much and that often and diuers things, except Dogges flesh, for that cannot be so dressed and pre∣pared by the art of man, Aelianus A ecret in he foode. but they finde it out by their nose and auoide it. It is good to let the Whelpes sucke two monthes before they be weaned, and that of their owne Damme, for it is not so good for them to sucke another, and in the meane time exercise them to meate, as milke, Whay, Bread, and flesh; also from the spring vntill the Sunne entreth Cancer, at which time it is good to let them grow leane according to the verses of Neme∣sian. Consuetam minuisse saginam Prosuerit, tenuesque magis retinere cibatus, Ne grauts articulos deprauet pondere molles Nam tum membrorum nexus nodosque relaxant. And afterward when they are sixe months old amend their diet againe that they may grow strong. Tunc rursus miscere sero Cerealia dona Conueniet, fortemque dari de frugibus escam. Tardinus They will not eate bucke-mast wherewithall Hogges grow fat, for that breedeth in them the paine of the head. Athenaeus By eating the excrements of men they incurre many diseases: they are made drunke by the Herbe Oenutt as Crowes bee, they cannot endure Wine, but bread sopped in Wine they deuoure, dryed flesh & bread in Milke is their safest foode, if Cummin bee now and then mixed in their bread, they are not much troubled with wind in their bellyes. If you put a little Oyle in their Water to drinke or lappe, they will proue more able and swift to runne. If he refuse and loath his meate, take a little whot bread and giue it him before meat, a remedy for loathing meate. or dip broune bread in vineger and so presse or squise the liquor thereof into his nose, and it wil ease him. There is much a doe to chose a Whelpe vnder the Damme that will proue the best in the litter. Of the cho e o generous whelpe. Some obserue that which seeth last, and take that for the best; other remoue the Whelpes from the kennell and lay them seuerall and apart one from the other, then watch they which of them the Bitch first taketh and carrieth into her kennell againe, and that they take for the best, or else that which vomitteth last of all. Some againe giue for a certaine rule to know the best, that the same which waigheth least while it sucketh will proue best according to the verses of Nemesian. Pondere nam catuli poteris prependere vires Corporibusque leues, grauibus prenoscere cursu. But this is certaine that the lighter whelpe wil proue the swifter, and the heauier will bee the stronger: Other make this experiment, first they compasse in the Puppies in the absence of the Damme with a little circle of small sticks apt to burne, and stinking rags, Tardinus then set they them on fire about the whelps, and that puppy which leapeth ouer first, they take for the best, & that which cōmeth out last they condemne for the worst. Assoone as the bitch hath littered it is good to chuse them you meane to preserue, & to cast away the refuse, keepe them blacke, or broun, or of one colour; for the spotted are not to be accounted of. And thus much of the outward partes and the choice of Dogges. The manifolde attributes of Dogges amonge all Writers, doe decipher vnto vs their particular nature; as that they are called sharpe, bitter, fierce, subtill, sounding, bold, Of the nature and inward qualities of Dogges. cared for attention, affable, swift, speedy, Clamorous, wilde, faithfull, horrible, rough, fasting, cruell, vngentle, vncleane, hurtfull, biting, filthy, smelling, sent-follower, watch∣full, madde, hoarse, and quicke-nosed; beside many such other both among the Greekes and Latines. And likewise you shall reade of many perticular Dogges, and their names appellatiue, both in Greeke and Latine, which may be remembred also in this place, to shew what reconing all ages haue made of this beast: for it is necessary, that as soone as he beginneth to feede he presently receiue a name, such are these, of twoe sillables or more, as Scylax, Spoude, Alke, Rome, Lacon, Acalanthis, Agre, Labros, Hylactor, Alleus, Argus (one of Vlisses Dogs) Asbolus, Augeas, Aura, Bria, Polis, Bremon, Katnon, Can che, Happarus, Charon, Chorax, Harpia, Lycitas, Chiron, Lycisca, Arcas, Dromas, Gnome, Eba, Hybris, Hyleus, Maira, Melampus, Orne, Lethargos, Nape ; beside infinite other among the ancients: but among the later writers, Turcus, Niphus, Falco, Ragonia, Serpens, Ichtia, Pi∣laster, Leo, Lupus, Stella, Fulgur, Bellina, Rubinum, Satinus, and Furia: so that euery Nation, and almost euery man hath a proper and peculiar name for his Dog, as well as for his Oxe. There is not any creature without reason, more louing to his Maister, Of the loue of a Dogge. nor more ser∣uiceable (as shall appeare afterward) then is a Dogge induring many stripes patiently at the hands of his maister, and vsing no other meanes to pacifie his displeasure, then humi∣liation, prostration, assentation, and after beating, turneth a reuenge into a more feruent and whot loue. In their rage they will set vpon all strangers, Pliny Plutarch Homer A secret to pacifie an an∣gry Dog. Aelianus yet heerein appeareth their Noble spirit, for if any fall, or sit downe on the ground & cast away his weapon, they bite him not; taking that declining for submissiue pacification. They meete their maister with reuerence and ioy, crouching or bending a little, (like shamefast and modest persons:) and although they know none but their maister and familiars, yet will they help any man against another Wilde beast. They remember voyces, and obey their leaders hissing or whisling. There was a Dogge in Venice which had beene three yeares from his Maister, a history of a dogs memo∣ry. yet knew him againe in the Market place; discerning him from thousands of people present; he remembreth any man which giueth him meat: when he fauneth vpon a man he wring∣eth his sknne in the forehead. The Dogge which is broad faced like a Lyon, Gillius K amides a secret in the feare of a dog is most full of stomach and courage; yet the tongue or skinne of an Hyaena (by naturall instinct) ma∣keth him runne away: sometimes they will agree with Wolues, for they haue engendered togither, and as the lute-strings made of a Wolfe and a Lambe cannot agree in musicke, but one of them will break, so also will a Dogs and a lambes. Aelianus thinketh that Dogges haue reason, The reason of Dogges. & vse logick in their hunting for they will cast about for the game, as a disputant doth for the truth, as if they should say either the Hare is gone on the left hand, or on the right hand, or straight forward, but not on the left or right hand and therefore straight forward. Whereupon he runneth foorth right after the true and infallible fooote-steps of the Hare. There was a Dogge in Affrica in a ship, which in the absence of the Mariners came to a pitcher of oyle to eate some of it, and the mouth of the pot being too narrow for his head to enter in (because the pot was not full) he deuised to cast flint stones into the vessel, whereby the Oyle rose to the top of the pitcher and so he eate thereof his fill, giuing euident testimony thereby, that he discerned by nature, that heauy thinges will sinke downe, and light thinges will rise vp and flye aloft. There is a Nation of people in Ethiopia (called Nubae ) which haue a Dogge in such ad∣mirable estimation, that they giue vnto him the honor of their King; Solinus Aelianus Pliny. Giraldus The honor done to dogs for they haue no o∣ther king but he. If he faune, they take him for well pleased; if he barke or fly vpon them, they take him for angry: and by his gestures and moouings they coniecture his meaning, for the gouerment of their state: giuing as ready obedience to his significations, as they can to any liuely speaking Prince of the world: for which cause, the Egyptians also picture a Dogge with a kings robe, to signifie a magistrate. Those people of Egypt also, obserue in their religious processions, and gesticulations, dumble-idle-gods, to carry about with them two Dogs, one Hawke, and one Ibis, and these they cal foure leters: by the two Dogs, they signifie the two Hoemishpheres which continually watch and goe ouer our heads; by the Hawke, the sunne; for the Hawke is a whot creature, and liueth vpon destruction: by the Ibis, the face of the Moone; for they compare the blacke feathers in this bird to hir darke part, and the white to her light: Other by the Dogges, do vnderstand the two Tro∣picks, which are (as it were the two porters of the sunne for the South and North; by the Hawke, they vnderstand the equinoctiall or burning line, because she flyeth high: by the Ibis, the Zodiacke : and indeede those painters which could moste aritificially decipher a Dog (as Nicias ) were greatly reuerenced among the Egyptians. The like folly (or impious beastlinesse) was that of Galba, who forsooke the presidents of his predecessors in stamping their coine with their owne image, and imprinted there∣upon his sealing ring, Coelius left him by his forefathers, wherein was engrauen, a dog bending vpon his female. I know not for what cause, the starre in the midst of heauen whereunto the sunne commeth about the Calends of Iuly, was tearmed Canis (a Dogge) and the whole time of the appearance of that starre, which is about thirty daies, should bee called Dog daies ; but onely because then the heate of the Sunne dooth torment the bodyes of men twice so much as at other times: whereupon they attribute that to the starre (which they call Sirius ) which rather is to be attributed to the Sun during that time euery yeare. Others fable, Varinus that there is another starre close to him (called Orion, ) who was an excel∣lent hunter, and after his death was placed among the starres, and the starre Canis beside him was his hunting dogge: but by this starre called of the Egyptians Solachin, and of the Graecians Astrocynon, Hesychius Arnobius commeth that Egyptian Cynicke yeare which is accomplished but once in a 1460. yeares. Vnto this starre were offered many sacrifices of Dogges in auncient time whereof there can be no cause in the World, as Ouid well noteth in these verses: Pro cane sidereo canis hic imponitur arae: Et quare fiat nil nisi nomen habet. As among the Carians, whereupon came the prouerbe of Caricum Sacrificium, for they sacrified a Dog in stead of a Goate, Pliny and the young Puppyes or Whelpes were also ac∣counted among the most auaileable sacrifices, for the pacifing of their idoll Gods. The Romans and Graecians had also a custom to sacrifice a Dog in their Lycaan and Lupercall feastes, which were kept for the honor of Pan, who defended their flocks from the Wolfe, Plutarch and this was performed in February yearely, either because that the Dogs were enimies to Wolues, or else for that by their barking, they draw them away in the night time from their Citty: or else, because they reckoned that a dogge was a pleasing beast to Pan, who was the keeper of Goats: so also the Graecians did offer a dog to Hecata who hath three heads, one of a Horse, another of a dogge, and the third head in the midst of a wilde man: and the Romans to Genetha, for the safe custody and welfare of all their houshold affayres. Their houshold Gods (called Lares ) were pictured and declared to the people sitting in Dogs-skinnes, and Dogges sitting beside them, eyther because they thereby signified their duty to defend the house and houshold, or else as Dogges are terrors to theeues and euill beasts, so these by their assistance were the punishers of wicked and euill persons: or rather that these Lares were wicked spirits pryeng into the affayres of euery priuate hou∣shold, P stus Coelius whom God vsed as executioners of his wrathful displeasure, vpon godlesse men. There were Dogges sacred in the Temple of Aesculapius, because he was nourished by their milke; and Iupiter himselfe was called Cynegetes, that is, a Dogge-leader ; because he taught the Arcadians first of all to hunt away noysome beasts by the helpe of Dogges: so also they sacrificed a Dogge to Mars, because of the boldnesse of that creature. To con∣clude, such was the vnmemorable vanity of the Heathens in theyr goddes and sacrifices, as it rather deserueth perpetuall obliuion then remembrance, Arnobius Gyraldus for they ioyned the shapes of men and Beastes togither (saith Arnobius ) to make Goddes Omnigenumque deum mon∣stra & latrator Anubis, such were theyr Cynocephali, Ophiocephali, Anubis, Hecata, that is as much to say, as halfe men, halfe Dogges, halfe Serpents, but generally all Monsters: and for the many imaginary virtues the ancients haue dreamed to be in Dogs, they also in many places haue giuen vnto them solemne funerals in their hallowed Coemiteries, & af∣ter they were dead, they ceased not to magnifie them, as Alexander, Of dishonor and ignobili∣ty of Dogs. which built a City for the honor of a Dog. All this notwithstanding, many learned and wise men in al ages haue rekconed a Dogge but a base and an impudent creature, for the Flamen Dialis of Iupiter in Rome, was com∣maunded to abstaine from touching of Dogges, for the same reason, that they were pro∣hibited & not permitted to enter into the castle of Athens & Isle of Delos, bycause of their publique and shamelesse copulation: and also, that no man might be terrified by their presence from supplication in the temples. The foolishnesse of a Dogge appeareth in this, that when a stone or other thing is cast at him, he followeth the stone and neglect∣eth the hand that threw it, according to the saying of the Poet: Marcellus Arripit vt lapidem catulus, morsuque fatigat, Nec precussori mutua damna facit. Sic plerique sinunt reros clabier hostes, Et quos nulla grauant noxia dente petant. Likewise men of impudent wits, shamlesse behauiors in taking and eating meat, were called Cynicks ; for which cause Athenaeus speaketh vnto Cynicks in this sort: You do not O Cynici leade abstinent and frugall liues but resemble Dogges: and whereas this foure-footed beast differeth from other creatures in foure things, Porphyrius you only follow him in his vi∣ler and baser qualities, that is, in barking and license of railing, in voracity and nudity, without all commendation of men. The impudency of a Dogge is eminent in all cases to be vnderstood, Homer Horace for which cause that audatious Aristogiton sonne of Cidimachus was called a Dogge, and the furies of an∣cient time were figured by blacke Dogges, and a Dog was called Erinnis: Cerberus him∣selfe with his three heads signified the multiplicity of Diuels, that is, a Lyons, a Wolfes, and a fawning Dogges, one for the earth, another for the Water, and the thirde for the aire: for which cause Hercules in slaying Cerberus, is said, to haue ouercome all temptati∣on, vice, and wickednesse, for so did his three heads signifie: other by the three heads, vn∣derstand, the three times; by the Lyon, the time present; by the wolfe, the time past; and by the fawning Dog, the time to come. It is deliuered by authors, that the roote of Oliander, or else a Dogs tooth bound a∣bout the arme, do restraine the fury and rage of a Dogge: also there is a certain litle bone in the left side of a Toade (called Apocynon ) for the vertue it hath in it against the violence of a Dogge: It is reported by Pliny, that if a liue Rat be put into the pottage of Dogges, after they haue eaten thereof they will neuer barke any more, and Aelianus affirmeth so much of the Weasils taile, cut off from him aliue, and carried about a man: also if one carry about him a Dogges hart, or Lyuer, Constantius or the skinne wherin Puppies lye in their dams belly (called the Secundine) the like effect or operation is attributed to them against the violence of dogs. There is a little blacke stone in Nylus about the bignesse of a Beane, at first sight whereof a dog wil run away. Such as these I saw at Lyons in France, which they called Sea-beanes, Stobaeus and they prescribed them to be hanged about a Nurses necke to encrease her milke: but to conclude the discourse of the basenesse of a Dogge, those two prouerbes of holy Scrip∣ture, one of our Sauiour Mat. 7. Giue not that which is holy to Dogs ; and the other of Saint Peter 2. Epistle Cap. 2. the Dogge is returned to the vomit, doe sufficiently conuince, that they are emblems of vile, cursed, rayling, and filthy men; The vse of their parts. which esteeme not holy things, but eate vp againe their owne vomits. The skinnes of Dogges are dressed for gloues, and close Bootes, the which are vsed by such as haue vlcerous and swelling Legges or Limbes, for by them the aflicted place re∣ceiueth a double reliefe; first, it resisteth the influent humors, and secondly, Blondus. it is not exas∣perated with Woollen. The Turkes colour their Dogs tailes withred, and it is a custom of Hunters to take Dogges and tie them in the Woods vnto trees by their stones, for by crying they prouoke the Panther to come vnto them. It is not to be doubted but that the flesh of dogges, is vsed for meate in many places although the opinion of Rasis be true and consonant to reason, that all deuouring Crea∣tures, as Dogges, Foxes, and Wolues; haue no good flesh for meate, bycause they en∣gender melancholy; and yet Galen thinketh, that it is like to the flesh of a Hare, especial∣ly young Whelpes were held amonge the Romanes a delicate meate, and were vsed by their priestes; and amonge Whelpes they attrybuted most vertue to their flesh which were eaten before they did see, Oppianus The flesh of Dogs eaten. for by them came no euill humor at al, as is often set down in Plautus. Instaurion . Peter Martir and Scaliger doe affirme, of Cozumella, and Lucatana, and other Islands of the new World, that the people there doe eate a kind of Dogge which cannot barke: These Dogges are vile to looke vpon like young Kyds. The inhabitants of Corsica, which are fierce, angry, Wilde, cruell, audatious, dissemblers, actiue and strong, do also seede vpon Dogges both wilde and tame: and it is thought that their meate is a little furthe∣rance to their inclination, for such is the naturall disposition of Dogs: and Sciltbergerus, in the booke of peregrinations affirmeth also, that the Tartarians in Ibissibur doe after the same manner feede vpon the flesh of Dogges: from hence it commeth, that men resem∣ling a Dog in a plaine forhead and narrow, are said to be foolish; in a smooth and stretched out, flatterers; those which haue great voyces like a Ban-dog, are strong; they which raile much (like often barking Dogges) are of a doggish, angry, disposition. He which hath a great head like a Dog is witty; Admantius hee which hath a little head like an Asses is blockish, they which haue fiery eyes like Dogs, are impudent and shamelesse: Thinne lips with narrow folding corners, in Dogs is a token of generosity, and in men of magnanimity: they whose lippes hange ouer their canine teeth, are also adiudged raylers, and virulent spea∣kers: and as Carnarius obserueth, vaine glorious braggarts. A wide mouth, betokeneth a cruell, madde, and wicked disposition; a sharpe nose, an angry mind: as a round, blunt, and solide Nose, signifieth a Lyons stomach and worthinesse. A sharpe chin, vaine bab∣ling and wantonnesse; they which are small in their girting steade about their Ioynes, doe much loue hunting. Stobaeus in his wicked discourse or dispraise of women affirmeth, that the curst, sharp, smart, curious, daynty, clamorous, implacable and wanton-rowling-eyed Women, were deriued from Dogges: and Hesiode to amend the matter saith, when Iupiter had fashio∣ned man out of the earth, he commaunded Mercury to infuse into him a Canine minde, and a clamorous inclination: but the Prouerbe of Salomon Cap. 30. concludeth the excel∣lency of a Dog saying: There be three things which goe pleasantly, and the fourth ordereth his pace aright: The Lyon, which is the strongest among Beastes, and feareth not the sight of any bo∣dy: Munsterus a hunting Dog strong in his loynes, a Goate, and a King against whom there is no rysing vp: by all which is deciphered a good King; for the Lyon ryseth not against beastes, except he be prouoked; the Dog riseth not against his frends, but wilde beasts; and the he-Goat goeth before his flocke like a guide and keeper. OF THE GREY-HOVND, with a naration of all strong and great hunting DOGGES. A Mong the diuers kinds of hunting Dogs, the Grey-hound or Graecian Dog, The name of a greyhound called Thereuticos or Elatica (by reason of his swiftnesse,) strength, and sagacity to follow and deuoure wilde beastes of great stature, deserueth the first place; for such are the conditions of this Dog, as Plato hath obserued, that he is reasonably sented to finde out, speedy and quicke of foote to follow, and fierce and strong to take and ouer∣come: and yet silent comming vpon his pery at vnawares, according to the obseruation of Gratius ; Siccanis illa suos taciturna superuenit hostes. Like to the Dogs of Acarnania which set vpon their game by stealth. Of these are the grea∣test dogs of the world, which in this place are briefely to be remembred. These haue large bodies little heads, beaked noses, but flat, broad faces aboue their eies, Oppianus Their descrip¦tion. Plutarch long necks but great next to their bodies, fiery eies, broad backs, and most generous sto∣macks, both against al wild beasts & men also. Their rage is so great against their prey, that sometimes for wrath they loose their eie-sight. They will not onely set vpon Buls, Boars, Their desire of fit game. and such like beastes, but also vpon Lyons, which Mantuan noteth in this verse; Et Truculentus Helor certare leonibus audens. The greatest dogs of this kind are in India, Scithia, and Hircania, Countries of Grey∣hounds. and among the Scithians they ioine them with Asses in yoake for ordinary labour. The Dogs of India are concei∣ued by Tigres, for the Indians wil take diuers femals or Bitches, and fasten them to trees in woods where Tygres abide: wherunto the greedy rauening Tiger commeth, Generation by Tygres. Aristotle and instant∣ly deuoureth some one or two of them, if his lust do not restrain him, & then being so filled with meate (which thing Tygers sildome meete withal) presently he burneth in lust and so lymeth the liuing Bitches, who are apt to conceiue by him: which being performd he reti∣reth to some secret place, & in the meane time the Indians take away the Bitches, of whom come these valourous dogs, which retain the stomack and courage of their father, but the shape & proportion of their mother, yet do they not keepe any of the first or second litter for feare of their Tygrian stomacks, but make them away and reserue the third litter. Of this kind were the Dogs giuen to Alexander by the King of Albania, Pliny. A history of Alexanders dogs. when he was going into India, and presented by an Indian, whom Alexander admired, and being desi∣rous to try what vertue was contained in so great a body, Gillius Aelianus Pliny. Strabo Pollux. caused a Boare and a Hart to be turned out to him, and when he would not so much as stir at them, he turned Beares vnto him, which likewise he disdained and rose not from his kennel; wherewithal the king being moued, commaunded the heauy and dul beast (for so he termed him) to be hanged vp: his keeper the Indian informed the king that the dog respected not such beasts, but if he would turne out vnto him a Lyon, he should see what he would do. Immediatly a Lyon was put vnto him, at the first sight whereof he rose with speede (as if neuer before hee saw his match or aduersary worthy his strength) and bristling at him, made force vpon him and the Lyon likewise at the Dogge, but at the last, the Dogge tooke the Chappes or snowt of the Lyon into his mouth, where he held him by maine strength vntill hee strangled him, doe the Lyon what he could to the contrary, the King desirous to saue the Lyons life, willed the Dogge shoulde be pulled off, but the labour of men and all their strength was too litle to loosen those irefull and deepe biting teeth which he had fastened. Then the Indian infourmed the King that except some vio∣lence were done vnto the Dog to put him to extreame paine, he would sooner die then let goe his holde; whereupon it was commaunded to cut off a piece of the Dogges taile, but the Dog would not remoue his teeth for that hurt: then one of his legges were likwise se∣uered from his body, whereat the Dogge seemed not apalled; after that another legge, and so consequently all foure, whereby the truncke of his body fell to the grounde, still holding the Lyons snowt within his mouth, and like the spirit of some malicious man chu∣sing rather to die then spare his enimie. At the last, it was commaunded to cut his heade from his body, all which the angry beast indured, and so left his bodiles head hanging fast to the Lyons iawes: whereat the king was wonderfully mooued, and sorrowfully repented his rashnes in destroying a beast of so noble spirite, which could not be daunted with the presence of the king of beasts: chusing rather to leaue his life then departe from the true strength and magnanimity of mind. Which thing the Indian perceiuing in the K. to mi∣tigate the Kings sorrowe, presented vnto him foure other Dogges of the same quantity and nature, by the gift whereof he put away his passion, and receiued rewarde with such a recompence as well beseemed the dignity of such a King, and also the quality of such a present. Pliny reporteth also that one of these did fight with singular courage and policy with an Elephant: and hauing got holde on his side, neuer left till he ouerthrewe the beast and perished vnderneath him. These Dogges growe to an exceeding greate stature, and the next vnto them are the Albanian Dogs. The Arcadian Dogs are said to be generated of Li∣ons. Pollux Th Alb i∣an Dogges Solmus. Seneca In Canaria one of the fortunate Ilands, their Dogs are of exceeding stature. The Dogs of Creete are called Diaponi, and fight with wilde Boares: the Dogs of Epirus called Chaonides of a Citie Chaon, are wonderfully great and fierce; they are likewise called Molosssi, of the people of Epirus so termed, these are fayned to be deriued of the Dog of Cephalus, The Dogges Molosse of o Creet. Aristotle. Albertus Ʋarinus. the first Greyhound whome stories mention: and the Poe s say, that this Grey∣hound of Cephalus, was first of all fashioned by Vulcax in Monesian brasse, and when he liked his proportion, he also quickned him with a soule, and gaue him to Iupiter for a guift, who gaue him away againe to Europa, she also to Minos, Minos to Procris, and Procris gaue it to Cephalus : his nature was so resistable, that he ouertook all that he hunted, like the Teume∣sian Foxe. Therefore Iupiter to auoid confusion, turned both the incomprehensible beasts into stones. This Moloskus or Molossus Dog, is also framed to attend the folds of Sheepe, and doth defend them from Wolues and theeues, whereof Virgill writeth thus: Veloces Spartae catulos acremque Molossum Pasce fero pingui nunquam custo dibus illis Nocturum stabulis, furem incursusque luporum Aut imparatos a Tergo horrebis Iberos. These hauing taken holde, will hardly be taken off againe, like the Indians and Prasian Dogs, for which cause they are called incommodestici, that is, modi nescij such as knowe no meane, which caused Horace to giue counsell to keepe them tied vp saying. Teneant acres tora molossos. The people of Epirus doe vse to buy these Dogges when they die, and of this kind were the Dogges of Scylla, Pollux. Nicomedes, and Eupolides. The Hircanian Dogges are the same with the Indian. The Poeonian, Persian, and Median, are called Syntheroi, that is companions, bost of hunting, and fighting, as Gratius writeth: Indocilis dat proelia medus. The Dogges of Locus and Lacaene are also very great and fight with Bores. There are also a kind of people called Cynamolgi, Xenophon. e as neere India, so called because for one halfe of the yeare they liue vpon the milke of great Dogges, which they keepe to defend their Coun∣trey from the great oppression of Wilde cattell, of people that liue vpon the m of Dogs which descend from the Woodes and Mountaines of India vnto them yearely, from the Summer solstice to the middle of Wynter, in great numbers of swarmes like Bees returning home to their Hiues and Hony-combes; These cattell set vpon the people and destroy them with their Hornes, except their Dogges be present with them, which are of great stomach and strength, that they easily teare the Wilde cattell in pieces, and then the people take such as be good for meate to themselues, and leaue the other to their dogges to feed vpon: Aelianus the residue of the yeare they not onely hunt with these Dogs, but also milke the females drinking it vp like the milke of sheepe or Goats. These great dogs haue also deuoured men, for when the seruant of Diogenes the Cynike ranne away from his maister, beinge taken againe and brought to Delphos, for his punishment he was torne in pieces by Dogs. Aelianus Dogs deuou∣rers of men. Euripedes also is said to be slaine by dogs, whereupon came the prouerb C os Dike, a Dogs reuenge: for King Archelaus had a certain dog which ran away from him into Thracia, and the Thracians (as their manner was) offered the same Dog in sacrifice, the King hearing thereof, Valerius m laied a punishment vpon them for that offence, that by a certaine day they should pay a talent; the people breaking day, suborned Evripides the Poet (who was a great fauorite of the Kings) to mediate for them, for the release of that fine; wherunto the king yealded: after∣ward as the said king returned from hunting, his dogs stragling abroad, met with Euripedes and tore him in pieces, as if they sought reuenge on him, for being bribed against their fellow which was slaine by the Thracians. But concerning the death of this man, it is more probable that the dogs which killed him, were set on by Aridaeus and Cratenas, two Thessa∣lian poets his emulatours & corriuals in poetry, which for the aduancement of their own credit, cared not in most sauage and Barbarous manner, to make away a better man then themselues. There were also other famous men which perished by Dogges, as Actaeon, Thrasus, and Linus ; of Thrassus Onid writeth thus; Praedaque sis illis quibus est laconia Delos Aute diem Raptonon ade unda Thraso. And of Linus and Actaeon in this manner; Quique verecunda speculantem membra Dianae, Quique Crotopiaden diripuere Linum. Lucian that scoffing Apostata, who was first a Christian and afterward endeauored all his wit to raile at christian religion, euen as he lacerated and rent his first profession, so was he rent in pieces by dogs; and Heraclitus the Phylosopher of Athens, hauing beene long sick and vnder the hands of Physitians, he oftentimes anointed his body with Bugils-sewet, & on a day hauing so annoynted himselfe, lying abroad sleeping in the sun, the dogs came, Ranisius and for the desire of the fat tore his body in pieces. I cannot heere forget that memora∣ble story of two christian Martyres, Gorgonius and Dorotheus, which were put to death vn∣der Diocletian in the ninth persecution, and when they were dead, Ranisius Text their carkases were cast vnto hungry dogs of this kind, kept for such purposes, yet would not the dogges once so much as stir at them, or come neere to touch them; & because we may iudge that the ra∣uening nature of these creatures was restrained by diuine power, we also read that when Benignus the Martyr, by the commaundement of Aurelian, was also throwen aliue to be deuoured of these dogs, he escaped as free from their teeth, as once Daniell did from the Lyons den. I may also adde vnto these the dogs of Alania and Illiria, called Mastini, who haue their vpper lips hang ouer their neather, and looke fierce like Lyons, whom they re∣semble in necke, eies, face, colour, and nailes; falling vpon Beares, and Boares, like that which Anthologius speaketh off, that leaped into the sea after a Dolphin, and so perished; or that called Lidia, slaine by a Boare; whose epitaph Martiall made as followeth: Amphitheatrales inter nutrita magistros Lydia dicebar, domino fidissima dextro Nec qui Dictaea Cephalum de gente secutus. Non me longa dies, nec inutilis abstulit aetas. Fulminea spumantis apri sum dente perempta, Nec quaerar inferras quamuis cito rapta per vmbras. Venatrix siluis aspera, blanda domi Qui non Erigones mallet habere Caenem Lucifera pariter venit ad aestra deae Qualia Dulychio fata fuere cani Quantus erat Calydon aut Erymanthe tuus, Non potui fato nobiliore mori. There be in France certaine great Dogs (called Auges ) which are brought out of great Brittaine, The French Dogges. to kill their Beares, Wolues, and wilde Boares; these are singularly swift and strong, and their leaders, the better to arme them against the teeth of other beasts, couer some of their parts with thicke cloutes, and their neckes with broad collars, or else made of Badgers skins. In Gallia Narbon, they call them Limier, and the Polonians call all great made Dogs for the Wolfe and such like beastes, ( Vislij :) and peculiarly for the Beare and Bore, Charzij, for Hares and foule, Pobicdnizcij, and Dogs of a middle scantling bee∣twixt the first and the second psij. Grey-hounds are the least of these kinds, and yet as swift and fierce as any of the residue, refusing no kind of Beast, if he be turnd vp thereunto, except the porcupine, who casteth her sharp pens into the mouth of al dogs. The quali∣ties and parts of a good Grey-hound Pliny. Xenophon. The best Grey-hound hath a long body, strong and reasonable great, a neate sharpe head, and splendent eyes, a long mouth, and sharp teeth; little eares and thin gristles in them, a streight neck, and a broad and strong brest, his forelegs straight and short, his hinder legs long and straight, broad shoulders, round ribs, fleshy buttockes, but not fat, a long taile, strong and full of sinnewes, which Nemesi∣an describeth elegantly in these verses. —Sit cruribus altis Costarum sub fine decenter prona carinam: Renibus ampla satis validis diductaque coras Sit Rigidis multamque gerat sub pectore lato Quae sensim rursus sicca se colligat aluo; Cuique nimis molles fluitent in cursibus aures Elige tunc cursu facitem facilem facilem{que} recursis Dum superant vires, dum loeto flore iuuentus. Of this kind, that is alway the best to be chosen among the whelps, which way gheth ligh∣test: for it will be soonest at the game, and so hang vpon the greater beasts hindering their swiftnes, Bellisarius. vntill the stronger and heauier dogs come to helpe: and therefore besides the markes or necessary good parts in a Grey-hound already spoken of, it is requisite that he haue large sides, & a broad midriffe or filme about his hart, that so he may take his breath in and out more easily: a small belly, for if it be great it will hinder his speedy course, like∣wise his legs haue long, thin, and soft haires, and these must the hunter leade on the left hand if he be a foot, Pollux. and on the right hand if he be on horsebacke. The time of teaching a grey-hound. The best time to try them, and traine them to their game is at twelue months old, how∣beit some hunt them at ten months if they be males, and at 8. monthes if they be females, yet is it surest not to straine them or permit them to run any long course till they be 20. moneths old, according to the old verse, Libera tunc primum consuescant colla ligari: Iam cum bis denos phoebe repauerit ortus, Sed paruos vallis spatio septoue nouelli nec cursus virtute parem &c. Keepe them also in the leame or slip while they are abroad vntill they see their course, I meane the Hare or Deere, Aristotle Xenophon. & losen not a yong Dog, til the game haue ben on foot a good season, least if he be greedy of the prey he straine his lim still they breake. When the Hare is taken, deuide some part thereof among your Dogges, that so they may be prouoked to speed by the sweetnes of the flesh. The time of engendring. The Lacedemon grey-hound was the best breed, they were first bred of a Fox and a dog, and therefore they were called Alopecides, these admit copulation in the eight moneth of their age, and sometime in the sixt, and so continuing bearing as long as they liue, bea∣ring their burthen the sixth part of a yeare, that is, about sixty daies, one or two more or lesse, and they better conceiue and are more apt to procreation while they are kept in la∣bor, Pliny. Aristotle. then when they lie idle without hunting, & these Lacedemon Dogs differ in one thing from all other Dogges whatsoeuer, for wheras the male outliueth in vulgar dogges of all countries the female, in these the female out-liueth the male, yet the male performeth his labour with more alacrity, although the female haue the sharper sence of smel∣ling. The noblest kind of dogs for the Hare keep home, vnlesse they be led abroad, and sil∣dome barke: they are the best which haue the longest neckes, for which cause, Albertus. they vse this artificiall inuention to stretch their neckes; they dig a deep hole in the earth, wherein they set the Grey-hounds meat, who being hungry thrusteth downe his head to take it, but finding it to be past his reach, stretcheth his neck aboue the measure of nature, by cu∣stome wherof, his necke is very much lengthned. Other place the Grey-hound in a ditch, An inuentiō to make a Grey-hound haue a long necke. and his meat aboue him, and so he teacheth vpward, which is more probable. It is the pro∣perty of these Dogs to be angry with the lesser barking Curs, and they will not run after euery trifling beast, by secret instinct of nature, discerning what kind of beast is worthy or vnworthy of their labor, disdaining to meddle with a little or vile creature. The diet of a good Grey-hound. They are nori∣shed with the same that the smaller hunting dogs are, and it is better to feede them with milk then whay. There are of this kind called Veltri, and in Italian Veltro, which haue bene procreated by a Dog and Leopard, and they are accounted the swiftest of all other. The grey-hounds which are most in request among the Germans are called Windspill, alluding to compare their swiftnes with the wind, the same are also called Turkischwind and H tz∣hund, and Falco a Falcon, is a common name whereby they call these Dogges. The French make most account of such as are bred in the mountaines of Dalmatia, or in any other mountains, especially of Turkey, for such haue hard feet, long eares, and bristle tayles. There are in England and Scotland, two kind of hunting dogs, and no where else in al the world; the first kind they call in Scotland Ane Rache, and this is a foot smelling creature, both of wilde beasts, Birds, and Fishes also, which he hid among the Rockes, the female hereof in England is called a Brache. The second kind is called in Scotland a Sluth-hound, being a little greater then the hunting hound, and in colour for the most part browne, or sandy-spotted. The sence of smelling is so quicke in these, that they can follow the foote∣steps of theeus, and pursue them with violence vntill they ouertake them; and if the theef take the water, they cast in themselues also, and swim to the other side, where they find out againe afresh their former labor, vntill they find the thing they seeke for: for this is com∣mon in the borders of England and Scotland, where the people were wont to liue much vpon theft, and if the dog brought his leader vnto any house, where they may not be suf∣fred to come in, they take it for granted, that there is both the stollen goods and the theef also hidden. THE HVNTING HOVND OF Scotland called Rache, and in En∣glish a HOVND. THE SLVTH-HOVND OF Scotland, called in Germany a Schlatthund. THE ENGLISH BLOVD-HOVNDE. W E are to discourse of lesser hunting Dogs in particular, as we finde them remembred in any Histories and descriptions, Poets or other Authors, according to the seuerall Countries of their breede and education; and first for the Brittish Dogges, their nature and qualities heereafter you shall haue in a seuerall discourse by it selfe. The blood-hounde differeth nothing in quality from the Scottish Sluth hound, sauing they are greater in quantity and not alway one and the same colour, for among them they are sometime red, san∣ded, blacke, white, spotted, and of such colour as are other hounds, but most common∣ly browne or red. The vertue of smelling called in Latine Sagacitas, is attributed to these as to the for∣mer hunting Hound, of whom we will first of all discourse, and for the qualities of this sence which maketh the Beast admirable, Plautus seemeth to be of opinion, that it re∣ceiued this title from some Magitians or sage wisards (called Sagae ) for this he saith; in Cureull. What smel∣ling or saga∣city in Dogs is. spea∣king of this beast: Canem hanc esse quidem Magis par fuit: nasum aedepoll sagax habet: It is also attributed to Mise, not for smelling, but for the sence of their palate or tast; and also to Geese: In a Dogge it is that sence which searcheth out and descryeth the roustes, fourmes, and lodgings of Wilde Beasts, as appeareth in this verse of Liuius Andro∣nicus : —Cumprimis fida canum vis Dirige odoriesquos ad certa cubilia canes. And for this cause it hath his proper Epithets as Odora canum vise, promissa canum vis, & naribus acres, & vtilis: Pincianus called this kind Plaudi, for so did Festus before him, and the Germans, Spurhund, and Leidthund, Iaghund, because their eares are long, thin, and hanging down, and they differ not from vulgar dogs in any other outward proportion, ex∣cept onely in their cry or barking voice. The nature of these is, being set on by the voice and Words of their leader, to cast a∣bout for the sitting of the Beast, and so hauing found it, with continuall cry to follow after it till it be wearied, without changing for any other, so that sometime the hunters them∣selues take vp the beast, at least wise the hounds sildome faile to kil it. They sildome barke, Bell sari except in their hunting chase; and then they follow their game throgh woods, thickets, thornes, and other difficult places, being alway obedient and attentiue to their leaders voice, so as they may not goe forward when he forbiddeth, nor yet remayne neere to the Hunters, whereunto they are framed by Art and discipline, rather then by any natu∣rall instinct. The White Houndes are said to be the quickest-sented and surest nosed, and there∣fore best for the Hare: the blacke ones for the Boare, and the red ones for the Hart and Roe: but heereunto I cannot agree, because their colour (especially of the two later) are too like the game they hunt, although there can be nothing certaine collected of their co∣lour, yet is the blacke hound harder and better able to endure cold, then the other which is white. In Italy they make account of the spotted one, especially white and yellowish, for they are quicker nosed: they must be kept tyed vp till they hunt, yet so as they be let loose now and then a little to ease their bellies, for it is necessary that their kennell be kept sweete and dry. It is questionable how to discerne a hound of excellent sence, yet (as Blondus saith) the square and flat Nose is the best signe and index thereof: likewise a small head, The choyce of a hound of the best nose. hauing all his Legs of equall length, his brest not deeper then the belly, and his backe plaine to his taile, his eies quicke, his eares long hanging, but sometime stand vp: his taile nimble, and the beake of his Nose alway to the earth, and especially such as are most silent or bark least. There are some of that nature, who when they haue found the beast they will stand still vntill their Hunter come, to whom in silence by their face, eie, and taile, Zenophon. Omni bonus Oppianus they shew their game. Now you are to obserue, the diuers and variable disposition of Houndes in their findidg out the beast: some, when they haue found the footesteps goe forward without any voice or other shew of eare or taile. Againe, another sort when they haue found the footings of the beast, pricke vp their eare a little, but either barke or wag their tailes; o∣ther will wag their taile but not moue their eares, other again wring their faces and draw their skins through ouer much intention, (like sorrowfull persons) and so follow the sent holding the taile immoueable. There be some againe which do none of these, but wander vp and down, barking about the surest markes, and confounding their own foot steps with the beastes they hunt, or else forsake the way, and so runne backe againe to the first heade; but when they see the Hare, they tremble and are affraid, not daring to come neare her, except she runne away first: these with the other, which hinder the cunning labors of their colleagues, trusting to their feet, and running before their betters, deface the best marke, or else hunt coun∣ter (as they terme it) take vp any false scent for the truth, or which is more reprehensible, neuer forsake the high waies, and yet haue not learned to hold their peace: vnto these al∣so you may adde, those which cannot discerne the footings or prickings of the Hare, yet will they runne speedily when they see her, or else at the beginning set forth very hot, and afterward tyre, and giue ouer lazily; all these are not to be admitted into the kennell of good hounds. But the good and aproued hounds on the contrary, when they haue found the Hare, make shew therof to the hunter, by running more speedily, and with gesture of head, eyes, ears, and taile, winding to the Hares muse, neuer giue ouer prosecution with a gallant noise, no not returning to their leaders, least they loose aduantage: these haue good and hard feet, and are of stately stomacks, not giuing ouer for any hate, and feare not the rockes or other mountaine places, as the Poet expresseth: Quae laus prima canum? quibus est audacia praeceps: Quae nunc elatis rimantur naribus auras: Et perdunt clamore feram, domiunque vocando Insequitur tumulosque anis camposque per omnes. Venandi sagax virtus viresque sequendi, Et nunc demisso quaerunt vestigia rostro. Increpitant quem si collatis effugit armis, Noster in arte labor positus, spes omnius in illa &c. And therefore also it is good oftentimes to lead the hounds to the mountaines for exer∣cise of their feet, when you haue no Hare or other beast. And whereas the nature of this Hare is, sometimes to leape and make headings, some∣time to tread sof ly without any great impression in the earth, or sometimes to lie downe and euer to leape or iumpe out and in to hir owne forme or sitting, the poore hound is so much the more busied and troubled to retaine the small sauour of her footings which she leaueth behind her: for this cause also it is to be noted, that the hound must be holpe no onely with the voyce, he best o hun∣ting. eye, and hand of the hunter, but also with a seasonable time, for in frosty weather the sauour congealeth and freezeth with the earth, so as you cannot hunt with any certainty vntil a thaw thereof, or till the sunne arise. Likewise if raine fall betwixt the going of the Hare and the hunting time, you cannot hunt till the water be dryed vp, for the drops disperse the scent of the Hare and the drye weather recollecteth it againe. The Summer time also is not for hunting, by reason the heate of the earth consumeth the sauour, and the night being then but short, the Hare trauaileth but little, feeding onely in the euening and morning. Likewise the fragrancy of euery greene herbe yeeldeth such a sauour, as doth not a little obliterate and ouersway the sauour of the beast: and therefore Aristotle in his wonders, sheweth that in Aetna in the summer time, there are such plenty of sweete smelling flowers especially of violets, which ouercome the Nostrils of the houndes, so as in vaine they follow the Hare. The best time therefore for hun ing with these hounds is the Autumne or fall of the leafe, by∣cause that then the odours of herbs are weakned, and the earth barer then at other times. The best manner to teach these hounds, The first training of hounds. is to take a liue Hare and trayle her after you vp∣on the earth, now one way, now another; and so hauing drawen it a conuenient space hide it in the earth; afterward set forth your hound neere the traile, who taking the winde run∣neth to and fro through Woods, fields, pastures, path-wayes, and hedges, vntill he finde which way the Hare is gon, but with a soft and gentle pace, vntill at length comming neer the lodged Hare, he mendeth his pace and bestirreth himselfe more speedily, leaping vpon his prey like some serpent, or as an arrow shot out of a bow, and so tearing it in pei∣ces or killing it with ioy, loadeth himselfe with his conquest and bringeth it to his maister with triumph, who must receiue both dog and it, with all tokens of loue into his owne bo∣some, which thing caused Nemesian to write thus; Quia freta si Morinum dubio refluentia ponto O quanta est merces & quantum impendia supra Protinus, haec vna est catulis iactura Britannis Veloces, nostrique orbis venatibus aptos. There are diuers Country Dogges like vnto these, as the Geloni and Gnosij, Of the hoūds of sundry countries. which cau∣sed Ouid to reckon and cal Ichnobates one of Actaeons Dogs Gnosius : whom Oppianus com∣pareth to the Polipus fish, which smelling in the waters the leaues of Oliues, by the sent is drawne to the land to eate them. The Spanish Dogs whome the French call Espagneulx, haue long eares, but not like a Braches, and by their noses hunt both Hares and Conies, they are not rough but smooth haired. The Tuscan Dogs are commended by Nemesian, notwithstanding, they are not beautifull to looke vpon, hauing a deepe shaggy haire, yet is their game not vnpleasant. Soepe Canum forma est illis licet obsita villo, Haud tamen in iucunda dabunt tibi munera praeda. Atque etiam leporum secreta cubilia monstrant, Quin et Tuscorum non est extrema voluptas. The Vmbrian Dogge is sharpe nosed, but fearefull of his sporte, as Gratius expresseth. Aut exigit Vmber: nare sagax e calle feras, At fugit aduersus idem quos efferent hostes Tanta foret virtus; & tantum vellet in armis. The Aetolian Dogs haue also excellent smelling Noses, and are not slow or fearefull, whom Gratius expresseth as followeth: Aetola quaecunque canis de stirpe malignum: Seu frustra ruinis properat furor et tamen illud Mirum quam celeres & quantum nare merentur: Et clangore citat, quos nondum conspicit apros, officium, &c. The French Dogges are deriued or propagated of the Dogges of great Brittaine, and are swift and quike sented, but not all, for they haue of diuers kindes as Gratius expresseth in these words: Magnaque diuersos extollit gloria celtas. They are very swift and not sharp nosed, wherefore they are mingled in generation with the Vmbrian Dogges, and therefore he celebrateth in many verses, the praise of the first Hunter (as he taketh him.) Hagno Baeonius and his Dog Metagon : and afterward the Dog Petronius, but it may be, that by Metagon, he meaneth the dogs of Lybia, because there is a Citty of that name: and by Petronius the dogs of Italy, for Petronia is a riuer that falleth into Tiber. The Gramarians cal a Dog engendered of a hound and an ordinary French Dog, Verta∣gus a tumbler: bycause he setteth himselfe to hunting, and bringeth his pray to his mai∣ster, whereupon Martiall made this Distichon: Non sibi, sed domino venatur vertagus acer Illaesum leporem qui tibi dente feret. Such be also other smelling Dogges, called in the German tongue (Lochhundle) that is Terriors or Beagles: these will set vpon Foxes and Badgers in the earth, and by biting expell them out of their Denns; whereof Aristotle reporteth a wonder, that one of them followed a Foxe vnder the ground in Boeotia, and there made so great anoyse by barking, that the hunters went also into the caue, where they saw many strange things which they related to the chiefe magistrate. The water Spagnell. Vnto all these smelling Dogs, I may also adde the water Spagnell, called in French Bar∣beti, and in Germany ( Wasserhund :) who is taught by his maister to seeke for thinges that are lost, (by words and tokens) and if he meet any person that hath taken them vp, he cea∣seth not to bay at him, and follow him til he appeare in his maisters presence. These also will take water-foule, and hunt Otters and Beauers (although houndes also will doe the same and watch the stroke of a gunn when the fouler shooteth, and instantly run into the water for the dead fowle, which they bring to their Maister. They vse to sneare their hin∣der parts, that so they may be the lesse annoyed in swimming; whose figure is in the bot∣tome of the former page described. I may heere also adde the Land-spani∣ell, attending a Hawke, who hath no proper name in English, except from the foule he hunteth; for which cause the French cal them dogs of the quails, and the Germaines Vogel-hund, a fowle hound, although all birdes little feare Dogs except the Bustard, who hath a heauy body, and is not able to fly farre: yet are these taught by Falconers to retriue & raise Partridges, for they first take them into the fields & shew them Partriges, whom after they haue sauoured twice or thrice, by custome they remember, and being vncoupled will bestirre themselues into all corners to finde them, being after a while very proud of emploiment, and very vnderstanding in their game: they are for the most part white or spotted, with red or blacke: the Pollonians call them ( Pobicuitzij ) & a poet describeth them thus: Stroza. Nare sagax alius, campisque vndisque volucres Quaerit & aduncus huc indefessus & illinc Discurrit. Of the mixt kind of Dogs called in English Mangrels or Mongrels. T Hose we call Mangrels which though they be on both sides, propagated by Dogges, yet are they not of one kind: for as once doggs coupled with Asses, Leopards, Lyons, Tigres, Apes, or any such beasts, according to the old verse; Cani congeneres lupus, vulpes, Hyaena Tygris So now it is ordinary for the greyhound to couple with the mastiue, the hound with the Grey-hound, the mastiue with the Shepherds dog, and the shepherds dog with anie other cur or Beagle, of these kinds we will now speak in order. And it is not to be omitted that this comixtion of kinds haue bin inuented by hunters for the amendment of some natural fault or defect they found in the Monophyli, that is, one single kind, and so heereby they added some qualities to their kind which they wanted before either in strength of body, or craft of wit: for they deriue both of these from their sires, Commixtiō of kinds in procreation. Pliny. wherfore Oppianus declareth that in the Commixtion of dogs, the ancients coupled together these kinds, the Arcadians with the Eleians, the Cretensians with the Paeonians, the Carians, with the Thracians, the Lacedemonians with the Tyrrhenian, the Sarmatian with the Iberian, & the Gallican dogs with the Vmbrian, because they want the quicke sence of smelling: according to these verses: Quondam inconsultis mater dabit vmbrica Gallis Sensum agilem, traxere animos de parte Gelonae Hyrcano, & vanae tantum Calydoniae linguae Exibit vitium patre emendata Molosso These dogs so generated are peculiarly termed in Greeke Hybris and Hybrida as Porphy∣rius writeth. The French Wolues were wont to haue a dog for their captain or leader, and it is ordinary for wolues & dogs to couple together as by experience it hath bin obserued: And it is certaine that mastiue dogs had their first beginning from this copulation, wher∣fore Virgill calleth one of these dogs Lycisa, Referensque lupumtoruo ore Lycisca. The dogs which are bred of Thoes, are commended for their rare qualities and vnder∣standing parts in the time of warres, by Hagnon Boeotius in these verses; Hic & semiferam thoum de sanguine prolem Seu norit voces, Seu Nudi ad pignora martis Ee subiere ascu, & paruis domuere lacertis vulpina specie. The Dogges of Hircania doe of themselues runne into the Woods, (like adulterers) and seeke out the Tygres to engender with them, which thing Gratius remembreth ele∣gantly in many verses: —Vltroque grauis succedere Tigrini Ausa canis, maiore tulit de sanguine fortum Excutiet silua magnus pugnator adepta: In the ranke of these Mangrels, I may adde in the next place those Dogges, Of Dogs de∣fenders and attenders on men. Blondus. called by the the Graecians Symmaschi, and Somatophylakes, because they attend vpon men in their tra∣uelles and labors to defend them, and are taught to fight for them, both against men and other beastes; wherein they are as ready both to take knowledge of violence offered to their maister, and also to reuenge or hinder it, as a reasonable creature can be. These are called of the Latines Canes socij defensores, sociable dogs; of which there be two sorts, the first, is lesser, beeing of rough and long curled haire, his head couered with long haire, Aelianus of a pleasant and tractable disposition, neuer going far from his maister, such was the Dog of Tobit, and the Dog of Codrus the Poet, called Chiron, where of Iuuenall maketh menti∣on; whose beneuolence and ready mind toward their keepers and norishers may appear by this story of Colophonius. Vpon a season he with a Seruant, and a Dog, A history of the rare trust of a Dog and and care to keepe his maisters goods. Tzetzes. went to a certaine Mart to buy merchan∣dise, and as they trauailed, his Seruant which caried the purse, diuerted a little out of the way, to performe the worke of nature, and the dog followed him: which being done, hee forgat to take vp the purse of mony that had fallen from him to the ground in that place, and so departed; the dog seeing the pursse, lay downe beside it and stirred not a foot; af∣terward the mayster and man went forward, missing their dog, and not their money, vn∣till they came to their mart or faire, and then for want of money were constrained to re∣returne backe againe without doing any farther thing: wherfore they resolued to go back againe the same way they came, to see if they could heare of their mony, and at last when they came to the place where the Seruant had left the pursse, there they found both Dog and monie togither the poore cur scarceable to see or stand for hunger: when he saw his maister and the seruant come vnto him, hee remoued from the earth, but life not able to tary any longer in his bodie, at one and the same time in the presence of his friendes and norishers he also died, and tooke of them both his last farewell, through the faithfull cu∣stodie of their forgotten goods; for which it is apparant, that one part of their faithful dis∣position is, to keepe their nourishers goods committed vnto them, as shall be afterwarde more at large manifested. Their watchfull care ouer their maisters may appeare also by these stories following, Aelianus. Tzetzes. for the dogs of Xantippus followed their maister to the ship, at what time he was forewar∣ned by the Oracle to depart out of Athens, by reason of the Persians war in Greece, and so they sailed with him to Salamine ; and as they sailed, by the waie he commanded one of them to be cast into the sea, who continued swimming after the ship vntill hee died, for which cause his maister buried him. When Galon the Syracusan, in his sleepe had a fearefull dreame that hee was strucken with fire from heauen, and with impression of feare, cryed out very lamentably; Asclepiades. Aelianus Pollux. his dog lying beside him, and thinking that some perill or theefe was doing violence to his mai∣ster, he presentlie leaped vp to the bed, and with scratching and barking awaked him, and so was he deliuered from a horrible feare▪ by the barking of his Dogge. The Tyrians which haue the best and the first purple in the world, are said in Historie to haue it by the first occasion of Hercules dog. Hercules falling in loue with a Nimph called Tyro, and trauelling toward her with his dog, he saw the purple fish creeping vpon a stone, the hungry dog caught the fish to eat it, and hauing deuoured it, his lippes were all dyed or coloured with the same: when the virgin Nymph saw that colour vpon the dogs lips, she denied the loue of Hercules, except he could bring her a garment of that colour, wher∣upon the valiant man knowing by what occasion the dogges lips receiued such a tincture, went and gathered all the purple fishes and Wormes hee coulde finde, and pressing their blood out of them, therewithall coloured a garment and gaue it to the Nymphe; for re∣ward whereof, he possessed the virgin, being by this meanes the first inuentor of the Phoe∣nissian tincture. Among these are to be remembred those louing Dogges, who either haue fought for their maisters and so defended them, Of fighting Dogs defending Men Aelianus. Tzetzes. or else declared them that murdered their keepers, or that which is more admirable, leaped into the burning fires which consumed the dead bodies of their norishers. Such an one was the dog of Caluus, who being slaine in a cer∣taine ciuill warre at Rome, and his enemies comming about him to cut off his head, his poore dog interposed his body betwixt the blowes, and would not suffer any foe once to touch his maisters carcasse, vntill by more then six hundred souldiors the dog was cut in pieces, so liuing and dying a most faithfull companion and thankefull friend to him that fed him. The like was in a dog of Darius the last king of the Persians, after he was slain by Besus & Narbazanes in the battell against Alexander, and so did the dog of Silanion fight for his Maister against theeues, Pliny▪ and when he was slaine, hee departed not from the body, but kept it warily from Dogs, Birds or wilde Beasts, sitting vpon his priuy parts, and couering them vntill the Roman captaines came and buryed it. Tzetzes. But most admirable was the loue of a certaine dog to his maister punished with death for the fact against Germanicus. Among other this dog would neuer go from the prison, and afterward when his maisters dead bodie was broght in the presence of many Romans, the cur vttered most lamentable and sorrowful cries; for which cause one of the compa∣ny threw vnto him some meat, to see if that would stoppe his mouth, and procure silence but the poore dog tooke vp the meat and caried it to his maisters mouth, not without the singular passion of the beholders: at last the body was taken vp and cast into the riuer Ti∣ber, the poore dog leaped in after it, and endeauored by all the meanes his weaknes could afford, to keep it from sinking, in the presence of an inumerable multitude, which without teares could not looke vpon the louing care of this brute beast. The dogs of Gelon, Hieron, Lysimachus, Pyrrhus king of Epirus, Polus the Tragoedian, and Theodorus, leaped into the burning fires which consumed their maisters dead bodies. Nicias a certaine hunter going abroad in the woods, chaunced to fall into a heape of bur∣ning coales, hauing no helpe about him but his dogs, there he perished, yet they ranne to the high waies and ceased not with barking and apprehending the garments of passen∣gers, to shew vnto them some direfull euent: and at last one of the trauailers followed the dogs, and came to the place where they saw the man consumed, and by that coniectured the whole story. The like did the dogs of Marius Caesarinus, for by their howling they pro∣cured company to draw him out of a deepe Caue, whereinto he was fallen on horse-back, and had there perished (being alone) except his hounds had released him. But that dogs will also bewray the murtherers of their friends and maisters, these stories following, may euidently manifest. Dogs detect∣ors of mur∣ders As King Pyrrhus by chance trauailed in his countrey, he found a dog keeping a deade corps, Plutarch. and he perceiued that the dog was almost pined, by tarrying about the body with out all food, wherefore taking pittie on the beast, he caused the body to be interred, and by giuing the dog his belly full of meat, he drew him to loue him, and so led him awaie: afterward as Pyrrhus mustred his souldiours, and euery one appeared in his presence, the dog also being beside him, he saw the murtherers of his maister, and so not containing himselfe with voice, tooth, and naile, he set vppon them: the king suspecting that which followd, examined them if euer they had seen or known that dog, they denied it, but the k. not satisfied, charged them that surely they were the murtherers of the dogs maister, (for the dog all this while remained fierce against them) and neuer barked before their appea∣rance, at the last their guilty consciences brake forth at their mouthes and tongues end, and so confessed the whole matter. The like was of two French Merchants which trauailed togither, Blondus and when they came into a certaine wood, one of them rose against the other for desire of his money, and so slew him and buried him. His dog would not depart from the place, but filled the woodes with howlings and cries; the murtherer went forwarde in his iourney, the people and in∣habitants neer the said wood, came and found both the murdered corps and also the dog which they tooke vp and nourished til the faire was done and the merchants returned, at which time they watched the high waies hauing the dog with them, who seeing the mur∣therer instantly made force at him without al prouocation, as a man would do at his mor∣tall enemy, which thing caused the people to apprehend him, who being examined, con∣fessed the fact, and receiued condigne punishment for so foule a deede. To conclue this discourse with one memorable story more out of Blondus, who rela∣teth that there was a certaine maid neer Paris, who was beloued of two young men; one of them on a daye tooke his staffe and his Dog and went abroad (as it was thought of pur∣pose to go to his loue) but it hapned that by the way he was murthered and buried, & the dog would not depart from the graue of his maister: at the last he being missed by his fa∣ther and brethren, one of them went also to seeke him and see what was become of him, and so seeking found the dog lying vpon his graue, who houled pittifully when he saw his maisters brother: the young man caused the ground to be opened, and so founde the wounded corps of his brother, which he brought away & caused to be buried til the mur∣therer could be descried: afterward in processe of time, the dogge in the presence of the dead mans brethren espied the murtherer, and presently made force vpon him very ea∣gerly; which the brethren suspecting, aprehended him, and broght him before the gouer∣nors of the citty, who examining him with all the policies they could inuent, what should be the occasion why the dog should so eagerly fly vppon him at all times, whensoeuer hee was brought into his presence, could not get any confession of the fact from him▪ then the magistrate adiudged that the young man and the Dogge should combate toge∣ther. The Dog was couered with a dry sod skin instead of armor, and the murtherer with a speare, and on his body a little thin linnen cloath, both came forth to the fight, A Combat. and so the man presently made force at the dog, who leaping vp to the face of the murtherer tooke him fast by the throat, and ouerthrew him, whereat the wretch amazed, cryed out, saying, take pitty on me you reuerend fathers, and pull off the dog from my throat, and I will con∣fesse al, the which they performed and he likewise declared the cause and manner of the whole murther, for which thing he was deseruedly put to death. And thus far of the lesser sociable dogs, now followeth the second kind of the greater. The greater sociable Dogs of defence are such as souldiors vse in warres, Blondus. The greater sociable dogs or defenders or else are a∣customed to keepe houses or cattell. This kind ought to be horrible, fierce, strange and vnacquainted with all except his maister, so that he be alway at daggers drawing, and rea∣dy to fight with all which shall but lay their handes vppon him, for which cause hee is to bee instructed from his littering or infancy by art and continuall discipline, to supply in him the defects of nature: let him be often prouoked to wrath by boies, and and afterward as he groweth, let some stranger set vppon him with Weapon, as staffe or sword, with whom let him combate till he be wearied, and then let him teare some peece of the prouokers garment, that so he may depart with a conceit of victory, after the fight tie him vp fast, and suffer him not to straggle loose abroad, but feed him thus tyed vp, so shall he in short time prooue a strong defender, and eager combatant against all men and beasts which come to deale with him. Of this sort they nourish many in Spaine and in o∣ther places. Such an one was the Dogge of Phaereus the tyrant of Thessalye, Blondus. Of defēding dogs. being a very greate and fierce beast, and hurtfull to all, except them who fed him dayly. He vsed to set this Dogge at his chamber dore to watch & gard him when he slept, that whosoere was afraid of the Dog, might not aproach neare without exquisite torments. Angcas gaue one of these to the Poet Eupolis, who taught him by many signes and gestures for the loue of his meate, to obserue his seruant Ephialtes, if at any time he stole money from him. And at the last, the wily Dog obserued the seruant so narrowly, that he found him robbing his maisters cof∣fers: wherefore he instantly fell vppon him and tore him in pieces. The which Dog after∣ward died for sorrow of his maisters death; wherupon Aelianus saith that the place of his death in A gina was called the place of mourning, to the day of his writing. Nicomedes king of Bythinia had one of these Molosssian great Dogs, which he norished verie tenderly, Tzetzes. A rianus. and made it very familiar with him selfe: it fell out on a time, that this king being in dalliance with his wife Ditizele in the presence of the Dog, and she againe hang∣ing about the kings necke, kissing and prouoking him to loue with amorous gestures, the Dog thinking she had beene offering some violence to his maister the king, presently lew vpon her, and with his teeth pulled her right shoulder from her bodie, and so left the amo∣rous Queen to die in the armes of her louing husband: which thing caused the king to ba∣nish the Dogge for euer out of his sight, A cruel mur∣ther of a Q. by a Dogge. for sorrow whereof he soone after died; but the Queene was most nobly buried, at Nicomedia in a golden sepulcher: the which was ope∣ned in the raigne of the Emperour Michaell, sonne of Theophilus ; and there the womans body was found whole and not putrified, being wrapped in a golden vesture, which taken off, and tried in furnace, yeilded aboue an hundred and thirteen pounds of pure gold. When a Dragon was setting vppon Orpheus, as he was occupied in hawking, by his Dogs his life was saued and the Dragon deuoured. And when Caelius one of the Senators of Placentia being sicke, was set vpon by certaine lewd fellowes, he reeceiued no wounde till his Dog was slaine. A most me∣morable sto∣ry of the dog of Rhodes There was neuer any thing more strange in the nature of Dogs, then that which hap∣ned at Rhodes besieged by the Turke, for the Dogges did there descerne betwixt Christi∣ans and Turkes; for toward the Turkes they were most eager, furious, and vnappeasable, but towards Christians although vnknowne, most easie, peaceable and placidious, which thing caused a certaine Poet to write thus: His auxere fidem quos nostro fulua sub aere Arua, & Carpathij defendit littora ponti. Pectora thoracum tunica sacrumque profano Miratur, nutritque Rhodos, custodibus illis It noctes animosa Phalanx innexa trilici Seligit, & blande exceptum deducit ad vrbem. There were two hundred of these Dogges which brought the king of Garamants from banishment, Aelianus. rescuing him from all that resisted. The Colophonian and Castabalensian or Cas∣pian Dogges fought in all their battels: Textor. so likewise the Cimbrian, Hircanian, and Magnesia Dogs: Pliny. Pet. Martyr. these also the Spaniards vsed in India to hunt out the naked people, falling vppon them as fiercely as euer they would vpon Bores, or other wilde beasts, being pointed vn∣to by their leaders finger. And for this cause was it, that Vaschus the Spaniard caused Pa∣era an Indian Lord, Deserued pu¦nishment of vnnatural co¦pulation and three other his wicked companions to be cast vnto Dogs for their vnnaturall lust: but the inhabitants of Caramair and Carib, doe driue away the Dogges, for through their admirable actiuitie in casting dartes, they pierce the Dogges ere euer they come neare them with poysoned arrowes. And thus much for the greate warlike defensiue Dogs. The Shep∣heards Dog. In the next place followeth the Shepheards Dog, called by Virgill, Pecuarius Canis : and this cannot properly be tearmed a dumbe keeper, for there is no creature that will more stirre, barke, and moue noise, then one of these against thiefe or wilde beast. They are al∣so vsed by Heards-men, Swine-heards, and Goate-heards, to driue away all annoyances from their Cattell, and also to guide and gouerne them, in executing their maisters plea∣sure vpon signes giuen them, to which of the stragling beastes they ought to make force. Neither is it requisite that this Dog be so large or nimble as is the Greyhounde, which is apointed for Deer and Hares. But yet that he be strong, quick, ready, and vnderstanding, both for brauling & fighting, so as he may feare away and also follow (if need be) the rauening Wolfe, and take away the prey out of his mouth; wherefore a square proportion of body is requisite in these beasts, and a tolerable lightnes of foot, such as is the village dog, vsed onely to keep hou∣ses, and hereof also they are the best, who haue the greatest or lowdest barking voices, Columella. & are not apt to leape vpon euery straunger or beast they see, but reserue their strength till the iust time of imployment. They approue also in this kind aboue all other, the white colour; because in the night time they are the more easily discernd from the Wolfe, or other noisome beast; Blondus. for ma∣ny times it falleth out that the Shepheard in the twy-light, Fronto. striketh his Dog insted of the Wolfe: these ought to be well faced, blacke or dusky eies, and correspondent Nostrils of the same colour with their eies, blacke ruddy lippes, a crooked Camoyse nose, a flat chap with two great broches or long straight sharpe teeth growing out thereof, couered with their lips, a great head, great eares, a broad breast, a thicke necke, broad and solide sholders, straight legs, yet rather bending inward then standing outward; great and thick feet, hard crooked nailes, a thicke taile which groweth lesser to the end thereof, then at the first ioynt next the body, and the body all rugged with haire, for that maketh the dog more terrible; and then also it is requisite that he be prouided of the beast breede, ney∣ther buy him of a hunter (for such an one will be gone at the sight of a Deer or Hare) nor yet of a Butcher, for it will be sluggish; therefore take him yong, Strabo and bring him vp con∣tinually to attend sheepe, for so will he be most ready, that is trained vppe among Shep∣heards. They vse also to couer their throat and necke with large broad collars, pricked throgh with nailes, for else if the wilde beast bite them in those places, the dogge is easily killed: varro Fronto. Ths loue of dogs to the cattell they attend. but being bitten at any other place he quickly auoideth the wound. The loue of such to the cattel they keepe is very great, especially to sheep; for when Publius Aufidius Pontianus, bought certaine flockes of Sheepe in the farthest part of Vmbria, and brought Shepherds with him to driue them home; with whome the dogs went along vnto Heraclea, and the Metapontine coasts, where the drouers left the cattell; the dogs for loue of the Sheepe yet continued and attended them, without regard of any man, and forraged in the fields for Rats and Mice to eat, vntill at length they grew weary and leane, and so returned back a∣gaine vnto Vmbria alone, without the conduct of men, to their first maisters, being many daies iourney from them. It is good to keep many of these together, at the least two for euery flock, that so when one of them is hurt or sick, the herd be not destitute: & it is also good to haue these male and female, yet some vse to geld these, thinking that for this cause they will the more vi∣gilantly attend the flocke: howbeit I cannot assent hereunto, because they are too gentle and lesse eager when they want their stones. They are to be taken from their dam at two moneths old, and not before: and it is not good to giue them hot meate, for that will en∣crease in them madnes, neither must they tast any of the dead carkasses of the Cattell, lest that cause them to fal vpon the liuing; for when once they haue taken a smatch of their blood or flesh, you shal sildom reclaim thē from that deuouring appetite. The vnderstan∣ding of these Shepherds dogs is very great, (especially in England) for the Shepherds wil there leaue their dogs alone with the flocks, and they are taught by custome, to keepe the sheep within the compasse of their pasture, and discern betwixt grasse and corn▪ for when they see the sheep fall vpon the corne, they run and driue them away from that forbidden fruit of their own acord; and they likewise keep very safely their maisters garments & vi∣ctuals, from all annoyance vntill their return. Ther is in Xenophon a complaint of the sheep to the shepherds concerning these dogs: we maruel (said the sheep) at thee, that seeing we yeeld thee milk, lambs, and cheese, wherupon thou feedest; A pretty fa∣ble of the Sheep & the Dogge. neuertheles thou giuest vnto vs nothing but that which groweth out of the earth, which we gather by our own industry; and whereas the dog doth none of al these, him thou feedest with thine own hand, & bred from thine own trencher: the dog hearing this complaint of the sheep, replyed; that his reward at the shepherds hand was iust, and no more then he deserved, for (saide hee) I looke vnto you, and watch you from the rauening Wolfe, and pilfering theefe, so as if once I forsake you, then it will not bee safe for you, to walke in your pastures, for perrill of death, whereunto the sheepe yeelded, and not replyed to the reasonable an∣swer of so vnreasonable a beast, and this complaint you must remember was vttered when Sheepe could speake, as well as men, or else it noteth the foolish murmuring of some vulgar persons, against the chiefe ministers of state, that are liberally rewarded by the princes owne hands, for their watchfull custody of the common-wealth, and thus much for the shepheards Dogge. OF THE VILLAGE DOGGE or house-keeper. T His village Dogge ought to be fatter and bigger then the Shepheards Dog, of an elegant, square and strong body, be∣ing blacke coloured, The colour of this Dog. and great mouthed, or barking bigly, that so he may the more terrifie the Theefe, both by day and night, for in the night the beast may seize vpon the rob∣ber before he discerne his blacke skinne, and therefore a spotted, branded, party-coloured Dogge is not approued. His head ought to be the greatest part of his body, hauing great eares hanging downe, and blacke eies in his head, a broade breast, thicke necke, large shoulders, strong Legs, a rough haire, short taile, and great nailes: his disposition must not be to fierce, nor yet to familiar, for so he will fawne vpon the theife as well as his maisters friend. Yet is it good that sometime he rise against the house-hold seruantes, and alway against strangers, and such they must be as can wind a stranger a farre off, and descry him to his maister by bar∣king as by a watch-word and setting vpon him, when he approcheth neere if he be prouo∣ked. Blondus commendeth in this kinde, such as sleepe with one eie open and the other shut, Of marriners dogs on ship∣board so as any small noyse or stirre wake and raise him. It is not good to keepe many of these curst Dogs together, and them fewe which bee kept must bee tyed vppe in the day time, that so they may be more vigilant in the night when they are let loose. There are of this kind which Marriners take with them to Sea, to preserue their goodes on ship-board, they chose them of the greatest bodyes and lowdest voice, like the Croatian Dog, resembling a Wolfe in haire and bignesse, and such as are very watchful, according to the saying of the Poet. Exagitant & lar, & turba Dianiae fures Peruigilant que lares peruigilant que canes. Vegetius And such also they nourish in Towers and Temples; in Towers, that so they may descry the approching enemy when the Souldiers are asleepe: for which cause, Dogs seene in sleepe, A temdorus signifie the carefull and watchfull wife, seruants, or Souldiers, which foresee dan∣gers and preserue publique and priuate good. There was in Italy a Temple of Pallas, wherein were reserued the axes, instruments, and armour of Diomedes and his colleages, Aristotle. r ldus keepers . D Chriso. the which temple was kept by Dogges, whose na∣ture was, as the Authour saith) that when Graecians came to that Temple, they would fawne vpon them as if they knew them; but if any other countrey men came, they shewed themselues Wild, fierce, and angry against them. The like thing is reported of a Temple of vulcan in Aetna, wherein was preserued a perpetuall and vnquencheable fire, for the watching whereof, were Dogges designed; who would fawne and gently flatter vpon all those which came chastly and religiously to worship there, leading them into the Temple like the familiars of their God; but vpon wicked and euill disposed leude persons, they barked and raged, if once they endeauored so much has to enter either the Wood or tem∣ple; but the true cause hereof was the imposture of some impure and deceiteful, vnclean, diabolical spirits. And by the like instinct, Scipio Affricanus was wont to enter into the Ca∣pital, and commaund the Chappel of Iupiter to be opened to him, at whom no one of the keeper-Dogs would euer stir, which caused the men-keepers of the temple much to mar∣uaile, whereas they would rage fiercely against all other: whereupon Stroza made these verses, falsely imputing this daemonicall illusion to diuine reuelation. Quid tacitos linquam quos veri haud niscia Crete Nec semper mendax, ait aurea templa tuentes Parcereque haud vlli solitos, (mirabile dictu) Docta Tyanei Aratos senioris ad ora Non magico Cantu sed quod diuinitus illis Insita vis omnio virtutis gnara latentis. The like strange thing is reported of a Temple or Church in Cracouia, Schneb rg▪ dedicated to the Virgin Mary, wherein euery night are an assembly of dogs, which vnto this day (saith the Author) meete voluntarily at an appointed houre, for the custody of the Temple, and those ornaments which are preserued therein against theefes and robbers: and if it for∣tune any of the Dogges be negligent and slacke at the houre aforesaide, then will he bark about the church vntill he bee let in, but his fellowes take punishment of him, and fall on him biting and rending his skinne, yea sometime killing him; and these Dogs haue a set dyet or allowance of dinner, from the Canons and preachers of the Church, which they duely obserue without breach of order; for to day twoe of them will goe to one Cannons house, and two to anothers, and so likewise al the residue in turnes successiuely visit the se∣uerall houses within the cloyster yard, neuer going twice together to one house, nor pre∣uenting the refection of their fellowes; and the story is reported by Antonius Schneberge∣rus for certaine truth, vpon his owne knowledge. OF THE MIMICKE OR GETVLI∣an Dogge, and the little Melitaean Dogges of GENTLEVVOMEN. T Here is also in England two other sortes of dogs, Iohn Cay. the figure of the first is heere expressed, being apt to imitate al things it seeth, for which cause some haue thoght, that it was cōceiued by an Ape, for in wit & disposition it resembleth an ape, The first ge∣neration of Mimicke Dogs. but in face sharpe and blacke like a Hedghog, hauing a short re∣curued body, very long legs, shaggy haire, and a short taile: this is called of some ( Canis Lucernarius ) these being brought vp with apes in their youth, learne very admirable & strange feats, The feates of dogs. wherof there were great plenty in Egypt in the time of king Ptolomy, which were taught to leap, play, & dance, at the hearing of musicke, and in many poore mens houses they serued insteed of seruants for diuers vses. These are also vsed by plaiers and Puppet-Mimicks to worke straunge trickes, for the sight whereof they get much money: Albertus such an one was the Mimicks dog, of which Plu∣tarch writeth that he saw in a publicke spectacle at Rome before the Emperor Vespasian. The dog was taught to act a play, wherein were contained many persons parts, I meane the affections of many other dogs: at last there was giuen him a piece of bread, wherein as was saide was poison, hauing vertue to procure a dead sleepe, which he receiued and swallowed; and presently after the eating thereof he began to reele and stagger too and fro like a drunken man, and fell downe to the ground, as if he had bin dead, and so laie a good space not stirring foot nor lim, being drawne vppe and downe by diuers persons, ac∣cording as the gesture of the play he acted did require, but when hee perceiued by the time and other signes that it was requisite to arise, he first opened his eies, and and lift vp his head a little, then stretched forth himselfe like as one doth when he riseth from sleepe; at the last vp he geteth and runneth to him to whom that part belonged, not without the ioy and good content of Caesar and all other the beholders. To this may be added another story of a certaine Italian about the yeare 1403. called Andrew who had a red Dog with him of strange feats, and yet he was blind. For standing in the Market place compassed about with a circle of many people, there were brought by the standers by many Rings, Iewels, bracelets and peeces of gold and siluer, and there within the circle were couered with earth, then the dog was bid to seeke them out, who with his nose and feet did presently find and discouer them, then was hee also commaun∣ded to giue to euery one his owne Ring Iewell, Bracelet, or money, which the blind dog did performe directly without stay or doubt. Afterward the standers by, gaue vnto him diuers peeces of coine, stamped with the images of sundry princes, and then one called for a piece of English money, and the Dog deliuered him a peece, another for the Em∣perors coine, and the dog deliuerd him a piece thereof: and so consequently euery prin∣ces coine by name, till all was restored; and this story is recorded by Abbas Vrspergensis, whereupon the common people said, the dog was a diuell or else possessed with some py∣thonicall spirit: & so much for this dog. Strabo. O the Meli∣taean Dogs. There is a towne in Pachynus, a promontory of Sicily (called Melita ) from whence are transported many fine little Dogs called ( Melitaei canes ) they were accounted the Iewels of women, but now the said towne is possessed by Fisher-men, and there is no such recko∣ning made of those tender little dogs, for these are not bigger then common Ferrets, or Weasils, yet are they not small in vnderstanding, nor mutable in their loue to men: for which cause they are also nourished tenderly for pleasure; whereupon came the prouerbe Melitaea Catella, for one norished for pleasure, & Canis digno throno, because princes hold them in their hands sitting vpon their estate. Theodorus the tumbler and dauncer had one of these, which loued him so well, that at his death he leaped into the fire after his body. Aelianus Now a daies, they haue found another breede of little dogs in all nations, Blondus. The arte of making of lit¦tle Dogs. beside the Melitaeon Dogs, either made so by art, as in∣closing their bodies in the earth when they are Whelpes, so as they cannot grow great, by reason of the place, or els, lessening and impayring their growth, by some kind of meat or nourishment. These are called in Germany▪ Bracken Schosshundle and Gutschenhundle, the Italians Bottolo, other Nations haue no common name for this kind that I know. Mar∣tiall made this Distichon of a little French dog; for about Lyons in France there are store of this kind, and are sold very deare; sometimes for ten Crownes, and sometimes for more. Delitias paruae si vis audire catellae Narranti breuis est pagina tota mihi. They are not aboue a foote▪ or halfe a foot long, and alway the lesser the more delicate and precious. Their head like the head of a Mouse but greater, their snowt sharpe, their eares like the eares of a Cony, short Legs, little feete, long taile, and White colour, and the haires about the shoulders longer then ordinary, is most cōmended. They are of plea∣sant disposition, and will leape and bite, without pinching, and barke prettily, and some of them are taught to stand vpright, holding vp their fore legs like hands, other to fetch and cary in their mouths, that which is cast vnto them. There be some wanton Women which admit them to their beds, and bring vp their young ones in their owne bosomes, for they are so tender, that they sildome bring aboue one at a time, but they loose their life. It was reported that when Grego in Syracuse was to goe from home among other Gossips, she gaue hir mayd charge of two thinges, one that she should looke to her child when it cryed, the other, that she should keepe the litle dog within doores. Publius had a little dog (called Issa ) hauing about the necke too siluer bels, vpon a silken Collar, which for the neatnesse thereof, seemed rather to be a picture then a creature; whereof Martiall made this elegant Epigram, comprehending the rare voyce and other gestures in it; Issa est purior osculo columbae Issa est earior indicis lapillis Hanc tu, si queritur loqui putabis Collo nexa cubat capitque somnos Et desiderio coacta ventris Sed blandopede suscitat toroque Castae tantus inest pudor catellae Pictam publius exprimit tabella Vt fit tam similis sibi nec ipsa Aut vtramque putabis esse veram Issa est blandior omnibus puellis, Issa est delitiae eatella publij Sentit tristitiamque gaudiumque Vt suspiria nulla sentiantur Gutta pallia, non fefallit vlla. Deponi monet & rogat leuari Hanc ne lux rapiat suprema totam. In qua tam similem videbis issam Issam denique pone cum tabella Aut vtranque putabis esse pictam. Marcellus Empiricus reciteth a certaine charme, made of the rinde of a wild figtree, held to the Spleene or liuer of a little dog, and afterward hanged vp in the smooke to dry, and pray that as the rind or barke dryeth, so the liuer or Spleene of the dog may neuer grow; and thereupon the dog, (saith that foolish Empericke) shall neuer grow greater, then it was at the time that the barke was hanged vp to drying. To let this trifle goe, I will end the discourse of these little dogs with one story of their loue and vnderstanding. There was a certaine noble Woman in Sicily, Aelianus A lamenta∣ble story of the discouery of an adul e∣rer by a little dog. which vnderstanding her husband was gone along iorney from home, sent to a louer (I should say an adulterer) she had, who came, & by bribery & mony giuen to her seruants, she admitted him to her bed, but yet priuately, more for feare of punishenent, then care of modesty; and yet for all her craft, she mistrusted not her little Dog, who did see euery day where she locked vp this adulte∣rer: at last, her husband came home, before her louer was auoyded, and in the night the little Dog seeing his true maister returned home, ranne barking to the doore and leaped vp thereupon, (within which the Whoremonger was hidden) and this he did oftentimes together, fawning and scraping his Lord and maister also; insomuch as he mistrusted (and the iustly) some strange euent: At last, he brake open the doore, and found the adulte∣rer ready Armed with his sword, wherewithall he slew the goodman of the house vna∣wares: and so enioyed the adulterate Woman for his wife, for murther followeth if it go not before adultery. This story is related by Aelianus to set forth a vertue of these little Dogs, how they obserue the actions of them that nourish them, and also some descreti∣on betwixt good and euill. The Dogs of Egypt are most fearefull of all other, and their custome is to runne and drinke, or drinke of the Ryuer Nilus running, for feare of the Crocodils; Aelianus Solinus. Whereupon came the Prouerbe, of a man that did any thing slightly or hastily, Vt canis & Nilo bi∣bit. Alcibiades had a Dog which he would not sell vnder 28. thousand Sesterces, that is se∣uen hundred French Crownes; it was a goodly and beautiful Dog, yet he cut off his taile, whereof he gaue no other reason, being demaunded why he so blemished his Beast, Pollux. but onely that by that fact hee might giue occasion to the Athenians to talke of him. The Dogges of Caramania can neuer be tamed, for their men also are wilde and liue without al law and ciuility: and thus much of Dogs in special. In the next place I thoght good to insert into this story the treatise of English Dogs, Aelianus first of all written in Latine by that famous Doctour in Phisicke Iohn Cay, and since translated by A. F. and directed to that noble Gesner, which is this that followeth, that so the reader may chuse whether of both to affect best. The Preamble or entrance, into the Treatise following. I Wrote vnto you (well beloued friend Gesner ) not many years past, a manifolde history, containing the diuers forms and fi∣gures of Beasts, Birds, and Fishes, the sundry shapes of plants, and the fashions of Hearbes, &c. I wrote moreouer, vnto you seuerally, a certaine abridge∣ment of dogs, which in your discourse vppon the formes of Beasts in the second order of milde and tamable beasts, wher you make mention of Scottish Dogs, and in the winding vp of your letter written and directed to Doctour Turner, com∣prehending a Catalogue or rehersall of your books not yet extant, you promised to set f r h in print, and openly to publish in the face of the world among such your workes as are not yet come abroad to light and sight. But, because certain circumstances were wan∣ting in my breuiary of English dogs (as seemed vnto me) I staied the publication of the same, making promise to send another abroad, which might be committed to the hands, the eies, the eares, the minds, and the iudgements of the Readers. Wherefore that I might performe that precisely, which I promised solemnly, accom∣plish my determination, and satisfie your expectation: which are a man desirous and ca∣pable of all kind of knowledg, and very earnest to be acquainted with al experiments: I wil expresse and declare in due order, the grand and generall kind of English dogs, the diffe∣rence of them, the vse, the properties, and the diuers natures of the same, making a tri∣partite diuision in this sort and manner. All English dogges be either of a gentle kind ser∣uing the game, a homely kind apt for sundry necessary vses, or a currish kind, meete for may toies. Of these three sorts of kindes so meane I to intreate, that the first in the first place, the last in the last roome, and the middle sort in the middle seate be handled. I call them vni∣uersally all by the name of English dogs, as wel because England only, as it hath in it En∣glish dogges, so it is not with the Scottish, as also for that wee are more inclined and de∣lighted with the noble game of hunting, for we Englishmen are adicted and giuen to that exercise and painefull pastime of pleasure, as well for the plenty of flesh which our parks and Forrests do foster, as also for the opportunity and conuenient leisure which wee ob∣taine, both which, the Scots want. Wherefore seeing that the whole estate of kindly hun∣ting consisteth principaly in these two points, in chasing the beast that is in hunting, or in taking the bird that is infowling. It is necessary and requisite to vnderstand that there are two sorts of dogs by whose meanes, the feates within specified are wroght, and these pra∣ctises of actiuity cunningly and curiously compassed, by two kindes of Dogs, one which rouzeth the beast & continueth the chase, another which springeth the bird, and bewrai∣eth the flight by pursute. Both which kinds are termed of the Latines by one common name, that is, Canes Venatici, hunting dogs. But because we English men make a diffe∣rence betweene hunting and fowling, for they are called by these seuerall words Venatio, & Aucupium, so they term the dogs whō they vse in these sundry games by diuers names, as those which serue for the beast, are called Venatici, the other which are vsed for the fowl are called Aucupatorij. The first kind called Venatici I deuide into fiue sorts, the first in perfect smelling, the se∣cond in quicke spying, the third in swiftnes and quicknes, the fourth in smelling and nim∣blenes, the fift in subtility and deceitfulnes, heerein these fiue sorts excelleth. Of the Dogge called a Harier, in Latine Leuerarius. T Hat kinde of Dogge whome nature hath indued with the vertue of smel∣ling, whose property it is to vse a lustines, a readines, and a couragiousnes in hunting, and draweth into his nostrelles the aire or sent of the beast pur∣sued and followed, we call by this word Sagax, the Grecians by this woorde Ichueuten of tracing or chasing by the foote, or Rinelaten, of the nostrells, which be the instruments of smelling. We may knowe these kinde of Dogs by their long, large and bagging lips, by their hanging eares, reaching downe both sides of their chaps, and by the indifferent and measurable proportion of their making. This sort of Dogges we call Leuerarios Hariers, that I may comprise the whole number of them in certain spe∣cialities, and apply to them their proper and peculier names, forsomuch as they cannot all be reduced and brought vnder one sort, considering both the sundry vses of them, and the difference of their seruice whereto they be appointed. Some for the Hare, the Foxe, the Wolfe, the Hart, the Bucke, the Badger, the Otter, the Polcat, the Lobster, the Wea∣sell, the Conny. &c. Some for one thing and some for another. As for the Conny, whome we haue lastly set downe, we vse not to hunt, but rather to take it, sometime with the nette, sometime with a Ferret, and thus euery seuerall sorte is notable and excellent in his naturall quality and appointed practise. Among these sundry sortes, there be some which are apt to hunt two diuers beastes, as the Foxe otherwhiles, and other whiles the Hare, but they hunt not with such towardnesse and good lucke after them, as they doe that whereunto nature hath formed and framed them, not onely in ex∣ternal composition and making, but also in inward faculties & conditions, for they swarn oftentimes, and do otherwise then they should. Of the Dogge called a Terrar, in Latine Terrarius. A Nother sorte there is which hunteth the Foxe and Badger or Gray onely, whome we call Terrars, because they (after the maner and custom of Ferrets in searching for Connies) creep into the ground, and by that meanes make afraide, nippe, and bite the Foxe and the Badger in such sort, that either they teare them in peeces with their teeth being in the bosome of the earth, or else haile and pull them perforce out of their lur∣king angles, darke dungeons, and close caues, or at the least through conceiued feare, driue them out of their hollowe harbours, in so much that they are compelled to prepare speedy flight, and being desirous of the next (albeit not the safest) refuge, are otherwise taken and intrapped with snares and nets laide ouer holes to the same purpose. But these be the least in that kind called Sagaces. Of the Dogge called a Bloudhound, in Latine Sanguinarius. T He greater sorte which serue to hunt, hauing lips of a large size, and eares of no small length, doe not onely chase the beast whiles it liueth, (as the o∣ther do of whom mention aboue is made) but being dead also by any man∣ner of casualty, make recourse to the place where it lyeth, hauing in this pointe an assured and infallible guide, namely, the sent and sauour of the bloud sprinkled here and there vpon the ground. For whether the beast beeing wounded, doth notwithstanding enioy life, and escapeth the hands of the huntsman, or whether the said beaste being slaine is conuayed cleanly out of the parke (so that there be some signifi∣cation of bloud shed) these Dogges with no lesse facility and easinesse, then auidity and greedinesse can disclose and bewray the same by smelling, applying to their pursute, agi∣lity and nimblenesse, without tediousnesse, for which consideration, of a singuler speci∣alty they deserued to be called Sanguinarij bloodhoundes. And albeit peraduenture it may chaunce, (as whether it chanceth seldome or sometime I am ignorant) that a peece of flesh bee subtily stolne and cunningly conuayed away with such prouisoes and preca∣ueats, as thereby all apparance of blood is either preuented, excluded, or concealed, yet these kinde of Dogs by certaine direction of an inward assured notice and priuy marcke, pursue the deede dooers, through long lanes, crooked reaches, and weary waies, without wandering awry out of the limites of the land whereon these desperate purloiners prepa∣red their speedy passage. Yea, the natures of these Dogs is such, and so effectuall is their foresight, that they can bewray, separate, and pick them out from among an infinite mul∣titude and an innumerable company, creepe they neuer so farre into the thickest throng, they will finde him out notwithstanding he lie hidden in wilde Woods, in close and ouer∣growen groues, and lurke in hollow holes apt to harbor such vngracious guestes. Moreouer, although they should passe ouer the water, thinking thereby to auoide the pursute of the hounds, yet will not these Dogs giue ouer their attempt, but presuming to swim through the streame, perseuer in their pursute, and when they be arriued and got∣ten the further bancke, they hunt vp and down, to and fro runne they, from place to place shift they, vntill thay haue attained to that plot of ground where they passed ouer. And this is their practise, if perdy they cannot at the first time smelling, find out the way which the deede doores tooke to escape. So at length get they that by art, cunning, and diligent indeuour, which by fortune and lucke they cannot otherwise ouercome. In so much as it seemeth worthely and wisely written by Aelianus in his sixt Booke, and xxxix. Chapter, To enthumaticon kai dialecticon, to be as it were naturally instylled into these kinde of dogges. For they will not pause or breath from their pursute vntil such time as they be apprehen∣ded and taken which committed the fact. The owners of such houndes vse to keepe them in close and darke channels in the day time, and let them loose at liberty in the night season, to the intent that they might with more courage and boldnesse practise to follow the fellon in the euening and solitary hours of darkenesse, when such ill disposed varlots are principally purposed to play their impu∣dent pageants, and imprudent pranks. These hounds (vpon whom this present portion of our treatise runneth) when they are to follow such fellowes as we haue before rehearsed, vse not that liberty to raunge at will, which they haue otherwise when they are in game, (except vpon necessary occasion whereon dependeth an vrgent and effectuall perswasion) when such purloyners make speedy way in flight, but being restrained and drawne backe from running at randon with the leame, the end whereof the owner holding in his hand is led, guyded, and directed with such swiftnesse and slownesse (whether he goe on foote, or whether he ride on horsebacke) as he himselfe in heart would wish for the more easie apprehension of these venturous varlots. In the borders of England and Scotland, (the often and accustomed stealing of cattell so procuring) these kind of Dogges are very much vsed, and they are taught and trayned vp first of all to hunt cattel, as well of the smaller as of the greater grouth; and afterwardes (that quality relinquished and lefte) they are learned to pursue such pestilent persons as plant their pleasure in such practises of purloyning as we haue already declared. Of this kind there is none that taketh the Water naturally, except it please you so to suppose of them which follow the Otter, which sometimes haunt the land, and sometime vseth the water. And yet neuertheles al the kind of them boyling and broyling with greedy desire of the prey which by swimming passeth through ryuer and flood, plunge amyds the water, and passe the streame with their pawes. But this property proceedeth from an earnest desire wherewith they be inflamed, ra∣ther then from any inclination, issuyng from the ordinance and appointment of nature. And albeit some of this sort in English be called Brache, in Scottish Rache, the cause herof resteth in the she-sex and not in the generall kind. For we English men call Bitches be∣longing to the hunting kind of Dogs, by the tearme aboue mentioned. To be short it is proper to the nature of houndes, some to keepe silence in hunting vntill such time as there is game offered. Other some so soone as they smell out the place where the beast lurketh, to bewray it immediately by their importunate barking, notwithstanding it be far & many furlongs of, cowching close in his cabbin. And these Dogs the younger they be, the more wantonly barke they, and the more liberally, yet, oftentimes without necessity, so that in them, by reason of their young yeares and want of practise, small certainty is to be reposed. For continuance of time, and experience in game, ministreth to these hounds, not onely cunning in running, but also (as in the rest) an assured foresight what is to be done, principally, being acquainted with their maisters watchwords, either in re∣uoking or imboldening them to serue the game. Of the Dogges called the Gasehound, in Latine Agasaeus. T His kinde of Dog which pursueth by the eye, preuaileth little, or neuer a whit, by any benefite of the nose, that is by smelling, but excelleth in perspicuity and sharpenesse of sight altogether, by the vertue whereof, being singuler and no∣table, it hunteth the Foxe and the Hare. This Dogge will choose and separate any beast from among a great flocke or heard, and such a one will it take by election as is not lancke, leane and hollow, but well spred, smooth, full, fat, and round, it followes by direction of the eye-sight, which indeede is cleere, constant, and not vncertaine, if a beast be wounded & go astray the dog seeketh after it by the steadfastnes of the eie, if it chance peraduenture to returne and be mingled with the residue of the flocke, this Dog spyeth it out by the vertue of his eye, leauing the rest of the cattell vntouched, and after he hath set sure sight vpon it he seperateth it from among the company and hauing so done ne∣uer ceaseth vntill he haue wearyed the Beast to death. Our countrey men cal this Dog Agasaeum. A gase-hound, because the beames of his sight are so stedfastly setled and vnmoueably fastned. These Dogs are much and vsually occu∣pied in the Northern parts of England more then in the Southern parts, & in feeldy lands rather then in bushy and woody places, horsemen vse them more then footmen, to the intent that they might prouoke their horses to a swift gallop (wherewith they are more delighted then with the prey it selfe) & that they might acustome their horse to leap ouer hedges and ditches, without stop or stumble, without harme or hazard, without doubt or danger, and to escape with safegard of life. And to the end that the riders themselues when necessity so constrained, and the feare of further mischiefe inforced, might saue themselues vndamnified, and preuent each perillous tempest by preparing speedy flight, or else by swift pursute made vpon their enimies, might both ouertake them, encounter with them, and make a slaughter of them accordingly. But if it fortune so at any time that this dog take a wrong way, the maister making some vsuall signe and familiar token, hee returneth forthwith, & taketh the right and ready trace, begining his chase afresh, & with a cleare voice, and a swift foot followeth the game with as much corage and nimblenes as he did at the first. Of the Dogge called the Grey-hound, in La∣tine Leporarius. W E haue another kind of dog, which for his incredible swiftnes is called Leporarius a Grey-hound, because the principall seruice of them de∣pendeth and consisteth in starting and hunting the Hare, which Dogs likewise are indued with no lesse strength then lightnes in maintenance of the game, in seruing the chase, in taking the Bucke, the Hart, the Doe, the Fox, and other beasts of semblable kind ordaind for the game of hunting. But more or lesse, each one according to the measure and proportion of their desire, and as might and hability of their bodies will permit and suffer. For it is a spare and bare kind of Dog, (of flesh but not of bone) some are of a greater sort, and some of a lesser, some are smooth skinned, and some are curled, the bigger therefore are appointed to hunt the bigger Beasts, and the smaller serue to hunt the smal∣ler accordingly. The nature of the Dogges I finde to be wonderfull by the testimony of all histories. For, as Iohn Froisart the historiographer in his 4. lib. reporteth. A Greyhound of King Richard, the second that wore the Crowne, and bare the Scepter of the realme of England, neuer knowing any man, beside the kings person, when Henry Duke of Lancaster came to the castle of Flinte to take king Richard, the Dog forsaking his former Lord and maister came to Duke Henry, fawned vpon him with such resemblances of goodwill and conceiued affection, as he fauoured king Richard before: he followed the Duke, and vtter∣ly left the King. So that by these manifest circūstances a man might iudge his Dog to haue beene lightened with the lampe of foreknowledge and vnderstanding, touching his old maisters miseries to come, and vnhappines nie at hand, which king Richard himselfe eui∣dently perceiued, accounting this deede of his dog a Prophecy of his ouerthrow. Of the Dogge called the Leuiner, or Lyemmer in Latine Lorarius. A Nother sort of Dogs be there, in smelling singular, and in swiftnesse in∣comparable. This is (as it were) a middle kind betwixt the Harier and the Greyhound, as well for his kind, as for the frame of his body. And it is called in Latine Leuinarius, a Leuitate, of lightnesse, and therefore may well be called a light-hound, it is also called by this word Lorarius, a Loro, a leame wherewith it is led. This Dogge for the excellency of his conditions, namely smelling and swift running, doth follow the game with more eagernes, and taketh the prey with a iolly quicknesse. Of the Dogge called a Tumbler, in Latine Vertagus. T His sort of Dogges, which compasseth all by craftes, fraudes, subtilties and deceiptes, we English men call Tumblers, because in hunting they turne and tumble, winding their bodyes about in circle-wise, and then fiercely and violently venturing vpon the beast, doth suddenly gripe it, at the very entrance and mouth of their receptacles, or closets before they can recouer meanes, to saue and succor themselues. This Dogge vseth another craft and s btilty: namely, when he runneth into a warren, or fetcheth a course about a conybur∣rough, he hunts not after them, he fraies them not by barking, he makes no countenance or shaddow of hatred against them, but dissembling friendship, and pretending fauour, passeth by with silence and quietnesse, marking and noting their holes diligently, where∣in (I warrant you) he will not be ouershot nor deceiued. When he commeth to the place where Conies be, of a certainety, he cowcheth downe close with his belly to the ground, prouided alwaies by his skill and pollicie, that the winde be neuer with him but against him in such an enterprize. And that the Conyes spy him not where he lurketh. By which meanes he obtaineth the scent and sauour of the conies, carryed towardes him with the wind and the ayre, either going to their holes, or comming out, either passing this way, or running that way, and so prouideth by his circumspection, that the silly simple Conny is debarred quite from his hole (which is the hauen of their hope, and the harbour of their health) and fraudulently circumuented and taken, before they can get the aduantage of their hole. Thus hauing caught his prey he carrieth it speedily to his maister, wayting his Dogs returne in some conuenient lurking corner. These Dogges are somewhat lesser then the houndes, and they be lancker and leaner, beside that they be somewhat pricke eared. A man that shall marke the forme and fashion of their bodies, may well cal them mungrel Grey-hounds if they were somewhat bigger. But notwithstanding they counteruaile not the Greyhound in greatnesse, yet will he take in one daies space as many Conies as shall arise to as big a burthen, and as heauy a loade as a horse can carry, for deceipt and guile is the instrument whereby he maketh this spoile, which pernicious properties supply the places of more commendable qualities. Of the Dogge called the theeuish Dogge, in Latine Canis furax. T He like to that whom we haue rehearsed, is the theeuish dog, which at the mandate & bidding of his master fleereth and leereth abrod in the night, hunting Conies by the aire, which is leuened with the sauour and conuei∣ed to the sence of smelling by the meanes of the wind blowing towardes him. During all which space of his hunting, he will not barke, least he should be preiudicial to his own aduantage. And thus watcheh and snatcheth vp in course as many Conies as his maister will suffer him, and beareth them to his maisters standing. The farmers of the countrey and vplandish dwellers, call this kind of Dog a night cur, be∣cause he hunteth in the darke. But let thus much seeme sufficient for dogs which serue the game and disport of hunting. Of gentle Dogges seruing the hauke, and first of the Spaniell, called in Latine Hispaniolus. S Vch Dogs as serue for fowling, I thinke conuenient and requisite to place in the second Section of this treatise. These are also to be reckoned and accounted in the number of the Dogs which come of a gentle kinde, and of those which serue for fowling, there be two sorts, The first findeth game on the land, the other findeth game on the water. Such as delight on the land, play their parts, either by swiftnesse of foot, or by often questing, to search out and to spring the bird for further hope of aduantage, or else by some secret signe and priuy token bewray the place where they fall. The first kind of such serue the Hauke, the second, the net, or, traine, The first kind haue no peculiar names assigned vnto them, saue onely that they be denominated after the birde which by naturall appointment he is alotted to take; for the which consideration, some bee called dogs for the Falcon, the Phesant, the Partridge, and such like. The common sort of people call them by one ge∣neral word, namely Spaniels. As though these kind of dogs came originally and first of al out of Spaine. The most part of their skins are white, and if they be marked with any spots they are commonly red, and somewhat great therewithall, the haires not growing in such thicknes but that the mixture of them may easily be perceiued. Othersome of them be reddish and blackish, but of that sort there be but a very few. There is also at this day a∣mong vs a new kinde of Dog brought out of France (for we Englishmen are marueilous greedy gaping gluttons after nouelties, and couetous cormorants of thinges that be sel∣dome, rare, strange, and hard to get.) And they be speckled al ouer with white and black, which mingled colours incline to a marble blew, which beautifieth their skins and affoor∣deth a seemely show of comlinesse. These are called French dogs as is aboue declared al∣ready. The Dog called the Setter, in Latine Index. ANother sort of Dogs be there, seruiceable for fowling, making no noise either with foot or with tongue, whiles they follow the game. These attend diligently vpon their maister & frame their conditions to such becks, motions, & gestures, as it shal please him to exhibite and make, either going forward, drawing backward, inclining to the right hand, or yealding toward the left, (In making mencion of fowles, my meaning is of the Patridge and the Q aile) when he hath found the bird, he keepeth sure and fast silence, he st ieth his steps and wil proceede no further, and with a close, couert, watching eie, layeth his belly to the ground and so creepeth forward like a worme. When he approcheth neere to the place where the bird is, he lies him down, and with a marke of his pawes betrayeth the place of the birds last abode, wherby it is supposed that this kind of dog is called Index, Setter, being indeede a name most consonant & agreeable to his quality. The place being knowne by the meanes of the Dog, the fowler immediatly openeth and spreedeth his net, intending to take them; which being done the dog at the customed becke or vsuall signe of his Maister riseth vp by and by, and draweth neerer to the fowle that by his presence they might be the authors of their own insnaring, and be ready intangled in the prepared net which cunning and artificiall indeuor in a dog (being a creature domesticall or hou∣shold seruant, brought vp at home with offals of the rencher, and fragments of victuals,) is not so much to be marueiled at, seeing that a Hare (being a wild and skippish beast) was seene in England to the astonishment of the beholders, in the yeare of our Lorde God, 1564. not only dauncing in measure, but playing with his former feete vpon a tabberet, and obseruing iust number of strokes (as a practitioner in that Art) besides that, nipping and pinching a dog with his teeth and clawes, and cruelly thumping him with the force of his feete. This is no trumpery tale, nor trifle toy (as I imagine) and therefore not vnwor∣thy to be reported, for I recken it a requital of my trauaile, not to drowne in the seas of si∣lence any speciall thing, wherein the prouidence and effectuall working of nature is to be pondered. Of the Dog called the water Spaniell, or finder, in Latine Aquaticus seu Inquisitor. T Hat kind of dog whose seruice is required in fowling vpon the water, part∣ly through a naturall towardnes, and partly by diligent teaching, is indu∣ed with that property. This sorte is somewhat big, and of a measurable greatnes, hauing long, rough, and curled haire, not obtained by extra∣ordinary trades, but giuen by natures appointment; yet neuerthelesse (friend Gesner ) I haue described and set him out in this manner, namely powled and not∣ted from the shoulders to the hindermost legs, and to the end of his taile, which I did for vse and customs cause, that being as it were made somewhat bare and naked, by shearing off such superfluity of haire, they might atchiue the more lightnesse, and swiftnes, and be lesse hindred in swimming, so troublesome and needelesse a burthen being shaken off. This kind of dog is properly called, Aquaticus, a water spaniel, because he frequenteth and hath vsuall recourse to the water where al his game lyeth, namely water fowles, which are taken by the help and seruice of them, in their kind. And principally ducks and drakes, whereup∣on he is likewise named a dog for the duck, because in that quality he is excellent. With these Dogs also we fetch out of the water such fowle as be stounge to death by any vene∣mous Worme▪ we vse them also to bring vs our boultes and arrowes out of the Water, (missing our marke) whereat we directed our leuell, which otherwise we should hardly recouer, and oftentimes they restore to vs our shaftes which wee thought neuer to see, touch, or handle againe, after they were lost: for which circumstaunces they are called Inquis tores, searchers, and finders. Although the Ducke otherwhiles notably deceiueth both the Dog and the Maister, by dyuing vnder the Water, and also by naturall subtilty, for i any man shall approch to the place where they builde, breede, and sit, the hennes goe out of their neasts, offering themselues voluntarily to the handes, as it were, of such as drawe neere their neastes. And a certaine weakenesse of their Wings pretended, and infirmity of their feet dissembled, they goe slowly and so leasurely, that to a mans think∣ing it were no maisteries to take them. By which deceiptfull tricke they doe as it were entise and allure men to follow them, til they be drawn a long distance from their nestes, which being compassed by their prouident cunning, or cunning prouidence, they cutte of all inconueniences which might grow of their returne, by vsing many careful and curi∣ous caueats, least their often hunting bewray the place where the young duklings be hat∣ched. Great therefore is their desire, and earnest is their study to take heede, not only to their brood but also to themselus▪ For when they haue an inkling that they are espied, they hide themselues vnder turfes or sedges, wherewith they couer and shroud themselues so closely and so craftely, that (notwithstanding the place where they lurk be found and pre∣fectly perceiued) there they will harbor without harme, except the water spaniel by quick smelling discouer their deceiptes. Of the Dogge called the Fisher, in Latine Canis Piscator. T He Dog called the fisher, whereof Hector Boethus writeth, which seeketh for fish by smelling among rockes and stones, assuredly I know none of that kind in England, neither haue I receiued by report that there is any such, albeit I haue beene diligent and busie in demaunding the question as well of fisher∣men, as also of hunts-men in that behalfe, being carefull and earnest to learne and vnder∣stand of them if any such were, except you hold opinion that the Beauer or Otter is a fish (as many haue beleeued) and according to their beleefe affirmed, as the bird Pupine, is thought to be a fish, and so accounted. But that kinde of Dog which followeth the fish to apprehend and take it (if there be any of that disposition and property) whether they do this thing for the game of hunting, or for the heate of hunger, as other Dogs doe which rather then they will be famished for want of foode, couet the carcases of carrion and pu∣trified flesh. When I am fully resolued and disburthened of this doubt I will send you cer∣tificate in writing. In the meane season I am not ignorant of that both Aelianus and Aeli∣us, call the Beauer kunapotamion a water dog, or a Dog-fish, I know likewise thus much more, that the Beauer doth participate this propertie with the dog, namely, that when fi∣shes be scarce they leaue the water and range vp and downe the land, making an insatia∣ble slaughter of young lambes vntill their paunches be replenished, and when they haue fed themselues full of flesh, then returne they to the water, from whence they came. But albeit so much be granted that this Beauer is a Dog, yet it is to be noted that we recken it not in the beadrow of English Dogs as we haue done the rest. The sea Calfe, in like man∣ner, which our contry men for breuity sake cal a Seele, other more largely name a Sea Vele, maketh a spoile of fishes betweene rockes and banckes, but it is not accounted in the ca∣talogue or number of our English Dogs, notwithstanding we call it by the name of a sea Dog or a sea-Calfe. And thus much for our Dogs of the second sort, called in Latine Au∣cupatorij, seruing to take fowle either by land or water. Of the delicate, neate, and pretty kind of dogges called the Spaniell gentle, or the comforter, in Latine Melitaeus or Fotor. T Here is, besides those which wee haue already deliuered, another sort of gentle dogs in this our English soile but exempted from the order of the residue, the Dogs of this kind doth Callimachus call Melitaeos of the Ise∣land Melita, in the sea of Sicily (which at this day is named Malta, an Ise∣land indeede, famous and renowned, with couragious and puisaunt soul∣diers valliantly fighting vnder the banner of Christ their vnconquerable captaine) where this kind of dogs had their principall beginning. These dogs are little, pretty, proper, and fine, and sought for to satifie the delicatenes of dainty dames, and wanton womens wils, instruments of folly for them to playe and dal∣ly withall, to tryfle away the treasure of time, withdraw their mindes from more com∣mendable exercises, and to content their corrupted concupiscences with vaine disport (A selly shift to shunne yrkesome idlenesse.) These puppies the smaller they be, the more pleasure they prouoke, as more meete play-fellowes for minsing mistrisses to beare in their bosomes, to keepe company withal in their chambers, to succour with sleep in bed, and nourish with meate at bourde, to lay in their lappes, and licke their lips as they ride in their Waggons, and good reason it should be so, for coursenesse with finenesse hath no fellowship, but featnesse with neatnesse hath neighbourhood enough? That plau ible prouerbe verified vpon a Tyrant, namely that he loued his Sow better then his son, may well be applyed to these kind of people, who delight more in Dogs that are depriued of all possibility of reason, then they do in children that be capeable of wisedome, and iudg∣ment. But this abuse peraduenture raigneth where there hath beene long lacke of issue, or else where barrennes is the best blossom of beauty. The vertue which remaineth in the Spaniel gentle, otherwise called the comforter. N Otwithstanding many make much of those pritty puppies called Spany∣els gentle, yet if the question were demaunded what property in them they spye, which should make them so acceptable and precious in their sight, I doubt their answer would belong a coyning. But seeing it was our intent to trauaile in this treatise, so, that the reader might reape some benefit by his reading, we will communicate vnto such coniectures as are grounded vpon reason. And though some suppose that such dogs are fit for no seruice, I dare say, by their leaues, they be in a wrong boxe. Among all other qualities therefore of nature, which be knowne (for some conditions are couered with continuall and thick clouds, that the eie of our capacities cannot pearse through thē) we find that these litle dogs are good to as wage the sicknes of the stomack, being oftentimes thereunto applied as a plaster preseruatiue, or borne in the bosom of the diseased and weake person; which effect is performed by their moderate heat. Moreouer the disease and sicknes changeth his place and entreth (though it be not precisely marked) into the dog, which to bee truth, experience can testifie, for these kind of dogs sometime fall sicke, and sometime die, without any harme outwardly inforced, which is an argument that the disease of the gentleman, or gentlewoman or owner whatsoeuer, entreth into the dog by the operation of heare intermingled and in∣fected. And thus haue I hetherto handled dogs of a gentle kind whom I haue comprehen∣ded in a triple diuision. Now it remaineth that I annex in due order, such dogs as be of a more homely kind. Dogges of a course kind seruing for many necessary vses, called in Latine Canis rustici, and first of the Shepherds dog called in Latine Canis Pastoralis. T He first kind, namely the shepherds hound is very necessary and profita∣ble for the auoyding of harmes, and inconueniences which may come to men by the meanes of beastes. The second sort serue to succour against the snares and attemptes of mischieuous men. Our shepherds dog is not huge, vaste, and big, but of an indifferent stature and growth, because it hath not to deale with the blood thirsty wolfe, sythence there be none in England, which happy and fortunate benefit is to be ascribed to the puisaunt Prince Edgar, who to the in∣tent that the whole countrey might be euacuated and quite cleered from wolfes, charged and commaunded the Welshmen (who were pestered with these butcherly beasts aboue measure) to pay him yearely tribute which was (note the wisedome of the king) three hun∣dred Wolfes. Some there be which write that Ludwall Prince of Wales paid yeerely to king Edgar three hundred wolfes in the name of an exaction (as we haue said before.) And that by the meanes hereof, within the compasse and tearme of foure years, none of those noysome and pestilent beastes were left in the coastes of England and Wales. This Edgar wore the crowne royall, and bare the Scepter imperiall of this kingdome, about the yeare of our Lord, nine hundred, fifty nine. Since which time we reade that no Wolfe hath beene seene in England, bred within the bounds and borders of this country, mary there haue beene diuers brought ouer from beyond the seas, for greedines of gaine and to make money, for gasing and gaping, staring, and standing to see them, being a strange beast, rare, and seldome seene in England. But to returne to our shepherds Dog. This dog ei∣ther at the hearing of his maisters voice, or at the wagging and whisteling in his fist, or at his s rill and horse hissing bringeth the wandering weathers and straying sheepe, into the selfe same place where his maisters will and wish is to haue them, wherby the shepherd reapeth this benefit, namely, that with little labour and no toyle or mouing of his feete he may rule and guide his flock, according to his own desire, either to haue them go for∣ward, or to stand still, or to draw backward, or to turne this way, or take that way. For it is not in England, as it is in France, as it is in Flaunders, as it is in Syria, as it is in Tartaria, where the sheepe follow the shepherd, for heere in our Countrey the shepherd followeth the sheepe. And sometimes the straying sheepe, when no Dog runneth before them, nor goeth about and beside them, gather themselues together in a flock, when they heere the shepherd whistle in his fist, for feare of the dog (as I imagine) remembring this (if vn∣reasonable creatures may be reported to haue memory) that the Dog commonly run∣neth out at his maisters warrant which is his whistle. This haue we oftentimes diligently marked in taking our iourney from towne to towne, when we haue hard a shepherd whi∣stle we haue rayned in our horse and stood still a space, to see the proofe and tryall of this matter. Furthermore with this dog doth the Shepherd take sheepe for the slaughter, and to be healed if they be sick, no hurt or harme in the world done to the simple creature. Of the mastiue or Bandogge called in Latine Villaticus or Cathenarius. T His kind of dog called a mastiue or Bandog is vaste, huge, stubborne, ougly, and eager, of a heuy and bourthenous body, and therefore but litle swiftnesse, terrible, and frightfull to behold, and more fierce and fell then any Arcadian cur (notwithstanding they are said to haue their generation of the violent lion.) They are called Villatici, because they are appointed to watch and keepe farme places and countrey cotages sequestred from common recourse, and not abutting vpon other hou∣ses by reason of distance, when there any feare conceiued of theeues, robbers, spoylers, and nightwanderers. They are seruiceable, against the Foxe and Badger, to driue Wilde and tame Swine out of Medowes, pastures, glebelands and places planted with fruite, to baite and take the Bull by the eare, when occasion so requireth. One Dog or two at the vttermost, sufficient for that purpose be the Bull neuer so monstrous, neuer so fierce, ne∣uer so furious, neuer so stearne, neuer so vntameable. For is is a kind of Dog capeable of courage, violent and valiant, striking cold feare into the hearts of men, but standing in feare of no man, insomuch that no weapons wil make him shrinke, nor abridge his bold¦nesse. Our English men (to the intent that their dogs might the more fell and sierce) assist nature with Arte, vse, and custome, for they teach their Dogs to bayte the Beare, to baite the Bull and other such like cruell and bloody Beastes (appointing an ouerseer of the game) without any Collar to defende their throates, and oftentimes they traine them vp in fighting and wrestling with any man hauing for the safegarde of his life, either a Pikestaffe, a Clubbe or a sword, and by vsing them to such exercises as these, their Dogs become more sturdy and strong. The force which is in them surmounteth all beleefe, the fast hold which they take with their teeth exceedeth all credit, three of them against a Beare, foure against a Lyon are sufficient, both to try masteries with them and vtterly to ouermatch them. Which thing Henry the seuenth of that name, King of England (a Prince both politique and warlike) perceiuing on a certaine time (as the report runneth) commaunded all such dogs (how many soeuer they were in number) should he hanged, being deepely displeased, and conceiuing great disdaine, that an ill fauoured rascall curre should with such violent villany, assault the valiant Lyon king of all beastes. An example for all subiectes worthy remembraunce, to admonish them, that it is no aduantage to them to rebell against the regiment of their ruler, but to keepe them within the limits of loyalty. I read an history answerable to this of the selfe same Henry, who hauing a nota∣ble and an excellent faire Falcon, it fortuned that the kings Falconers, in the presence and hearing of his grace, highly commended his maiesties Falcon, saying, that it feared not to intermeddle with an Eagle, it was so ventrous a Birde and so mighty, which when the king heard, he charged that the Falcon should be killed without delay, for the selfe same re son as it may seeme) which was rehearsed in the conclusion of the former history con∣cerning the same king. This dog is called in like manner, Cathenarius, a Cathena, of the chaine wherewith he is tyed at the gates, in the day time, least being lose he shoulde doe much mischiefe, and yet might giue occasion of fear and terror by his big barking. And albeit Cicero in his Oration had Pro. S. Ross. be of this opinion, that such dogs as barke in the broad day light should haue their legs broken, yet our countrey men, on this side the Seas for their carelesnes of life setting all at cinque and sice are of a contrary iudgement. For theeues rogue vp and downe in euery corner, no place is free from them, no not the princes pallace, nor the countreymans cotage. In the day time they practise pilfering, picking, open robbing, and priuy stealing, and what legerdemaine lack they? not fearing the shamefull and horrible death of hanging. The cause of which inconuenience doth not onely issue from nipping need and wrin∣ging want, for all that steale are not pinched with pouerty, some steale to maintain their excessiue and prodigall expences in apparrel, their lewdnes of life, their hautines of hart, their wantonnes of manners, their wilfull ydlenes, their ambitious brauery, and the pride of the sawcy Salacones me galorrou ton, vaine glorious and arrogant in behauiour, whose delight dependeth wholy to mount nimbly on horsse-backe, to make them leape lustilie, spring and prance, gallop and amble, to run a race, to wind in compasse, and so foorth, li∣uing altogither vpon the fatnes of the spoile. Othersome there be which steale, being ther∣to prouoked by penury and need, like masterles men applying themselues to no honest trade, but ranging vp and downe, impudently begging and complaining of bodily weak∣nesse where is no want of ability. But valiant Valentine the Emperor, by holsom lawes pro∣uided that such as hauing no corporall sickenes, sold themselues to begging, pleaded po∣uerty with pretended infirmity, and cloaked their ydle and slothfull life with colourable shifts and cloudy cozening, should be a perpetuall slaue and drudge to him, by whome their impudent idlenes was bewrayed, and laid against them in publick place, least the in∣sufferable slouthfulnes of such vagabonds should be burthenous to the people, or being so hatefull and odious, should grow into an example. Alfredus likewise in the gouernment of his common wealth, procured such increase of credite to iust ce and vpright dealing by his prudent acts and statutes, that if a man traue∣ling by the high way of the country vnder his dominion, chanced to loose a budget full of Gold, or his capcase farsed with things of great value, late in the euening, he should find it where he lost it safe, sound, and vntouched the next morning, yea (which is a wonder) at any time for a whole months space if he sought for it, as Ingulphus Croyladensis in his hi∣story recordeth. But in this our vnhappy age, in these (I say) our diuelish daies, nothing can scape the clawes of the spoiler, though it be kept neuer so sure within the house, albe∣it the doors be lockt and boulted round about. This dog in like maner of the Graecians is called Oikouros. Of the Latinists Canis Coltos, in English the Dog-keeper. Borrowing his name of his seruice, for he doth not onely keepe farmers houses, but also merchants mansions, wherein great wealth, riches, substance, and costly stuffe is re∣posed. And therefore were certaine dogs found and maintained at the common costs and charges of the Cittizens of Rome in the place cald Capitolium, to giue warning of theeues comming. This kind of dog is so called, In Latine Canis Laniarius, in English the Butchers dog. So called for the necessity of his vse, for his seruice affoordeth great benefit to the but∣cher as well in following as in taking his cattell when neede constraineth, vrgeth, and re∣quireth. This kind of Dog is likewise called, In Latine Molossicus or Molossus After the name of a countrey in Epirus called Molossia, which harboureth many stoute, strong, and sturdy Dogs of this sort, for the Dogs of that countrey are good indeede, or else there is no trust to be had in the testimony of writers. This dog is also called, In Latine Canis Mandatarius a Dog messen∣ger or Carrier. Vpon substanciall consideration, because at his maisters voice and commaundement, he carrieth letters from place to place, wrapped vp cunningly in his lether collar, fastned thereto, or sowed close therein, who, least he should be hindred in his passage, vseth these helpes very skilfully, namely resistance in fighting if he be not ouermatched, or else swiftnesse and readinesse in running away, if he be vnable to buckle with the Dog that would faine haue a snatch at his skinne. This kinde of Dog is likewise called, In Latine Canis Lunarius, in English the Mooner. Because he doth nothing else but watch and ward at an inch, wasting the wearisome night season without slombering or sleeping, bawing and wawing at the Moon (that I may vse the word of Nonius ) a quality in mine opinion strange to consider. This kind of dog is also called, In Latine Aquarius, in English a water drawer. And these be of the greater and the waighter sort, drawing water out of wels and deepe pits, by a wheele which they turne round about by the mouing of their burthenous bo∣dies. This dog is called in like manner. Canis Sarcinarius in latine, and may aptly be Englished, a Tynkers Curre. Because with marueilous patience they beare big budgets fraught with Tinkers tooles, and mettall meete to mend kettels, porrige-pots, skellets, and chafers, and other such like trumpery requisite for their occupacion and loytering trade, easing him of a great burthen, which otherwise he himselfe should carry vpon his shoulders; which condition hath challenged vnto them the forsaid name. Besides the qualities which we haue already recounted, this kind of Dogs hath this principall property ingrafted in them, that they loue their maisters liberally, and hate straungers despightfully; whereupon it followeth that they are to their maisters in traueiling a singuler safegarde, defending them force∣ably from the inuasion of villayns and theeues▪ preseruing their liues from losse, and their health from hazzard, their flesh from hacking and hewing, with such like desperate daun∣gers. For which consideration they are meritoriously tearmed. In latine Canes defensores : defending dogs in our mother tongue. If it chance that the maister be oppressed, either by a multitude, or by the greater vio∣lence and so be beaten downe that he lie groueling on the ground, (it is proued true by experience) that this dog forsaketh not his maister, no not when he is starke dead: But in∣during the force of famishment and the outragious tempestes of the weather, most vigi∣lantly watcheth and carefully keepeth the deade carkasse many daies, indeuouring fur∣thermore, to kill the murtherer of his maister, if he may get any aduantage. Or else by barking, by howling, by furious iarring, snarring, and such like means betrayeth the male∣factor as desirous to haue the death of his aforsaid maister rigoriously reuenged. An ex∣ample heerof fortuned within the compasse of my memory. The Dog of a certaine way∣faring man trauailing from the Citty of London directly to the Towne of ingstone (most famous and renowned by reason of the triumphant coronation of eight seuerall Kings) passing ouer a good portion of his iourney, was assaulted and set vpon by certaine confe∣derate theeues lying in waight for the spoyle in Come-parcke, a perillous bottom, compas∣sed about with Woods too well knowne for the manifold murders and mischeeuous rob∣beries their committed. Into whose handes this passieger chaunced to fall, so that his ill luck cost him the price of his life. And that Dog whose syer was English, (which Blondus registreth to haue beene within the bankes of his remembrance) manifestly perceiuing that his maister was mur∣thered (this chanced not farre from Paris ) by the hands of one which was a suiter to the same woman, whom he was a wooer vnto, did both bewray the bloody Butcher, and at∣tempted to teare out the villains throat, if he had not sought meanes to auoid the reuen∣ging rage of the dog. In fyers also which fortune in the silence and dead time of the night or in stormy weather of the saide season, the older dogs barke, ball, howle, and yell, (ye notwithstanding they be roughly rated) neyther will they stay their tongues till the hou∣should seruants awake, rise, search, and see the burning of the fire, which being perceiued they vse voluntary silence, and cease from yolping. This hath bin, and is found true by triall, in sundry parts of England. There was no fainting faith in that Dog, which when his maister by a mischance in hun∣ting stumbled and fel, toppling downe a deepe ditch being vnable to recouer of himselfe, the dog signifying his maisters mishap, rescue came, and he was hailed vp by a rope, whom the Dog seeing almost drawne vp to the edge of the ditch, cheerefully saluted, lea∣ping and skipping vpon his maister as though he would haue imbraced him, being glad of his presence, whose longer absence he was loath to lacke. Some Dogs there be, which will not suffer fierie coales to ly scattered about the hearth, but with their pawes will rake vp the burning coales, musing and studying first with themselues how it might conueni∣ently be done. And if so be that the coales cast to great a heat, then will they bury them in ashes and so remoue them forward to a fit place with their noses. Other dogs be ther which execute the office of a Farmer in the night time. For when his maister goeth to bedde to take his naturall sleepe. And when, A hundred bars of brasse and yron boltes, Make all things safe from startes and from reuolts. When Ianus keepes the gate with Argos eye, That dangers none approach, ne mischiefe nie. As Virgill vaunteth in his verses, Then if his maister biddeth him goe abroad, he linge∣reth not, but raungeth ouer all his lands there about, more diligently, Iwys, then anie farmer himselfe. And if he find any thing ther that is strange and pertaining to other per∣sons besides his maister, whether it be man, woman, or Beast, he driueth them out of the ground, not meddling with any thing that do belong to the possession and vse of his ma∣ster. But how much faithfulnes, so much diuersity there is in their natures. For there be some, which barke onely with free and open throat but wil not bite, some which do both bark and bite, and some which bite bitterly before they barke. The first are not greatly to be feared, because they themselues are fearefull, and feare∣full dogs (as the prouerbe importeth) barke most vehemently. The second are dangerous, it is wisedome to take heed of them, because they sound as it were, an Alarum of an afterclap, and these dogs must not be ouer much moued or pro∣uoked, for then they take on outragiously as if they were mad, watching to set the print of their teeth in the flesh. And these kind of dogs are fierce and eager by nature. The third are deadly, for they fly vpon a man without vtterance of voice, snatch at him, and catch him by the throat, and most cruelly bite out collops of flesh. Feare these kinde of Curres, (if thou be wise and circumspect about thine owne safety) for if they be stoute and stubborne Dogs, and set vpon a man at a suddaine vnwares. By these signes and to∣kens, by these notes and arguments our men discerne the cowardly Curre from the co∣ragious Dog, the bolde from the fearefull, the butcherly from the gentle and tractable. Moreouer they coniecture that a whelpe of an ill kind is not woorth keeping, and that no dog can serue the sundry vses of men so aptly and so conueniently as this sort of whom we haue so largely written already. For if any be disposed to draw the aboue-named seruices into a table, what man more clearely, and with more vehemency of voice giueth warning either of a wastfull beast, or of a spoiling theefe then this? Who by his barking (as good as a burning Beacon) foresheweth hazzardes at hand? What manner of beast stronger? What seruaunt to his maister more louing? What companion ruore trusty? What Watchman more vigilaunt? What reuenger more constaunt? What messenger more speedie? What Water▪bearer more painefull? Finally, what Packe-horsse more patient? And thus much concerning English dogs, first of the gentle kind, second∣ly of the courser kind. Now it remaineth that we deliuer vnto you the dogs of a mungrell or currish kind, and then will we performe our taske. Containing Curres of the mungrell and rascall sort, and first of all the Dog called in Latine, Admonitor, and of vs in English, Wappe or Warner. O F such Dogs as keepe not their kind, of such as are mingled out of sundry sortes, not imitating the conditions of some one certaine spice, because they resemble no notable shape, nor exercise any worthy propertye of the true, perfect and gentle kinde, it is not necessary that I write any more of them, but to banish them as vn∣profitable implements, out of the bounds of my booke, vnprofi∣table I say, for any vse that is commendable, except to entertaine strangers with barking in the day time, giuing warning to them of the house, that such and such be newly come, wherupon we cal them admonishing dogs, because in that point they performe their office. Of the Dog called Turnespete in Latine Veruuersator. THere is comprehended, vnder the Curres of the coursest kinde, a certaine dog in kitchen-seruice excellent. For when any meat is to be roasted, they go into a wheel, which they turning round about with the waight of their bodies, so dilligently looke to their businesse, that no drudge nor scullion can do the feate more cunningly. Whom the popular sort hereupon call Turnespets, being the last of all those which wee haue first mentioned. Of the Dogge called the dauncer, in Latine Saliator or Tympanista. THere be also dogs among vs of a mungrel kind, which are taught and excercised to daunce in measure at the musicall sound of an instrument, as, at the iust stroke of the drumbe, at the sweet accent of the Citerne, and tuned stringes of the harmonious Harp, shewing many pretty trickes by the gesture of their bodies. As to stand bolt vp∣right, to lie flat vpon the ground, to turn round as a ring holding their tails in their teeth, to beg for their meat, and sundry such properties, which they learne of their vagabundi∣call maisters, whose instruments they are to gather gaine withall in Citty, country, town, and village. As some which carry old Apes on their sholders in coloured iackets to moue men to laughter for a little lucre. Of other Dogs, a short conclusion, wonderfully ingendred within the coasts of this country. OF these there be three sorts. The first, bred of a bitch and a Wolfe, called in Latine Lyciscus. The second of a Bitch and a Fox, in Latine Lacaena. The third of a Beare and a Bandog, Vrcanus. Of the first we haue none naturally bred within the borders of England. The reason is for the want of Wolues, without whome no such dog can be ingendred. Againe, it is deliuered vnto thee in this discourse, how and by what meanes, by whose be∣nefit, and within what circute of time, this country was cleerely discharged of rauening Wolus, and none at al left, no, not to the least number, or to the beginning of a number, which is an Vnari. Of the second sort we are not vtterly voide of some, because this our English soile is not free from Foxes, (for indeed we are not without a multitude of them, insomuch as di∣uers keepe, foster, and feed them in their houses among their hounds and dogs, either for so e malady of mind, or for some sicknes of body) which peraduenture the sauor of that subtill beast would either mitigate or expell. The thirde which is bred of a Beare & a Bandog we want not heere in England, (A strange and wonderfull effect, that cruell enemies should enter into the worke of copula∣tion and bring forth so sauage a curre.) Vndoubtedly it is euen so as we haue reported, for the fiery heat of their flesh, or rather the pricking thorne, or most of all, the tickling lust of lechery, beareth such swing and sway in them, that there is no contrarietie for the time, but of constraint they must ioyne to engender. And why should not this be conso∣nant to truth? why should not these beasts breed in this land, as well as in other forreine nations? For we read that Tigres and Dogs in Hircania, that Lyons and dogs in Arcadia, and that Wolues and Dogs in Francia, couple and procreate. In men and women also lightned with the Lantarne of reason (but vtterly voide of vertue) that foolish, franticke, and fleshly action (yet naturally sealed in vs) worketh so effectualy, that many times it doth reconcile enemies, set foes at friendship, vnanimity, and attonement, as Moria mentio∣neth. The Vicane which is bred of a Beare and a dog, Is fierce, is fell, is stout and strong, And biteth sore to flesh and bone. His furious force indureth long In rage he will be rul'd of none. That I may vse the words of the Poet Gratius. This dog exceedeth all other in cruell con∣ditions, his leering and fleering lookes, his sterne and sauage vissage, maketh him in sight fearefull and terrible, he is violent in fighting, and wheresoeuer he set his tenterhooke teeth, he taketh such sure and fast hold, that a man may sooner teare and rend him assun∣der, then loose him and seperate his chaps. He passeth not for the Wolfe, the Beare, the Lyon, nor the Bull, and may woorthelie (as I thinke) bee companion with Alexanders Dog which came out of India. But of these, thus much, and thus farre may seeme suffi∣cient. A start to outlandish dogges in this conclusion, not impertinent to the Authors purpose. VSe and custome hath entertained other dogs of an outlandish kind, but a fewe and the same being of a pretty bignes, I meane Island dogs, curled and rough all ouer, which by reason of the length of their haire make shew neither of face nor of body. And yet these curs, forsooth, because they are so strange are greatly set by, esteemed, ta∣ken vp, and many times in the roome of the Spaniell gentle or comforter. The natures of men is so moued, naie rather married to nouelites without all reason, wit, iudgement or perseuerance, Erromen allotrian paroromen suggeneis. Outlandish toyes we take with delight, Things of our owne nation we haue in despight. Which fault remaineth not in vs concerning Dogs onely, but for artificers also. And why? it is manifest that we disdaine and contemne our owne workemen, be they neuer so skilfull, be they neuer so cunning, be they neuer so excellent. A beggerly beast brought out of barbarous borders, from the vttermost countries Northward, &c, we stare at, we gaze at, we muse, we meruaile at, like an Asse of Cumanum, like Thales with the brazen shanks, like the man in the Moone. The which default Hippocrates marked when he was aliue, as euidently appeareth in the beginning of his booke Peri agmon, so intituled and named: And we in our worke intituled De Ephemera Britanica, to the people of England haue more plentifully expressed. In this kind looke which is most blockish, and yet most waspish the same is most esteemed, and not among Cittizens onely and iolly Gentlemen, but a∣mong among lusty ordes also, and noblemen. Further I am not to wade in the foorde of this discourse, because it was my purpose to satisfie your expectation with a short treatise (most learned Conrade ) not wearisome for me to write, nor tedious for you to peruse. A∣mong other things which you haue receiued at my hands heretofore, I remember that I wrote a seuerall description of the Getullian dog, because there are but a few of them, and therefore very sildome seene. As touching dogs of other kinds you your selfe haue taken earnest paine in writing of them both liuely, learnedly, and largely. But because we haue drawne this libell more at length then the former which I sent you (and yet breefer then the nature of the thing might well beare) regarding your most earnest and necessary stu∣dies. I will conclude making a rehearsall notwithstanding (for memories sake) of certaine specialties contained in the whole body of this my breuiary. And because you participate principall pleasure in the knowledge of the common and vsuall names of Dogs (as I ga∣ther by the course of your letters) I suppose it not amisse to deliuer vnto you a short table containing as well the Latine as the English names, and to render a reason of euery par∣ticular appellation, to the intent that no scruple may remaine in this point, but that eue∣ry thing may be sifted to the bare bottome. A Supplement or Addition, containing a demonstration of Dogs names how they had their Origi∣nall. T He names contained in the generall table, forsomuch as they signifie no∣thing to you being a stranger, and ignorant of the English toong, except they be enterpreted: as we haue giuen a reason before of the Latin words, so meane we to do no lesse of the English, that euery thing may be mani∣fest vnto your vnderstanding. Wherein I intend to obserue the same order which I haue followed before. SAgax, in English Hund, is deriued of our English word hunt. One letter changed in another, namely T, into D, as Hunt, Hund, whom if you coniecture to be so named of your country word Hund, which signifieth the generall name ( Dogge ) because of the similitude and likenes of the words I will not stand in contradiction (friend Gesner ) for so much as we retaine among vs at this day manie Dutch words which the Saxons left at such time as they enioyed this countrie of Britaine. Thus much also vnderstand, that as in your language Hund is the common word, so in our naturall tongue ( Dogge ) is the v∣niuersall, but Hund is perticuler and a speciall, for it signifyeth such a dog onely as serueth to hunt, and therefore it is called a Hund. Of the Gasehound. The Gasehound called in latine Agasaeus, hath his name of the sharpenes and stedfast∣nes of his eie-sight. By which vertue hee compasseth that which otherwise he cannot by smelling attaine. As we haue made former relation, for to gase is earnestly to view & be∣hold, from whence floweth the deriuation of this Dogs name. Of the Grey-hound. The Grey-hound called Leporarius, hath his name of this word Gre, which word soun∣deth, Gradus in latine, in English Degree. Because among al dogs these are the most prin∣cipall, hauying the chiefest place, and being simplie and absolutelie the best of the gentle kind of hounds. Of the Leuyner or the Lyemmer. This dog is called a Leuyner, for his lightnes, which in latine soundeth Leuitas. Or a Lyemmer which word is borrowed of Lyemme, which the Latinnists name Lorum : and wherefore wee call him a Leuiner of this worde Leuitas : (as we doe manie things besides) why we deriue and draw a thousand of our tearmes, out of the Greeke, the Latine, the Ita∣lian, the Dutch, the French, and the Spanish tongue; (Out of which fountaines indeede, they had their Original issue.) How many words are buried in the graue of forgetfulnesse? growne out of vse? wrested awry? and peruersly corrupted by diuers defaults? we will declare at large in our booke intituled, Symphonia vocum Britannicarum. Of the Tumbler. Among hounds the Tumbler called in Latine Vertagus, which commeth of this word Tumbler, flowing first from the French fountaine. For as we say Tumble, so they Tum∣bier, reseruing our sence and signification, which the Latinnists comprehend vnder this word Vertere. So that we see thus much, that Tumbler commeth of Tumbier, the Vowell, I, changed into the Liquid, L, after the maner of our speech. Contrary to the French & the Italian tongue. In which two languages. A Liquid before a Vowell for the most part is turned into another Vowell. As, may be perceiued in the example of these two words Im∣plere & plano, for Impiere & panio, L, before, E, changed into I, and L, before A, turned into I, also. This I thought conuenient for a tast. After such as serue for hunting, orderly do follow such as serue for hawking and fow∣ling, Among which the principall and cheefest is the Spaniell, called in Latine Hispanio∣lus, borrowing his name of Hispania, wherein we Englishmen not pronouncing the A∣spiration H, nor the Vowell I, for quicknes and readinesse of speech say roundly a Spag∣nell. Of the Setter. The second sort is called a Setter, in Latine Index. Of the word ( Set ) which signifieth in English that which the Latinist; meane by this word Locum disignare, the reason is reher∣sed before more largely, it shall not therefore need to make a new repetition. Of the water Spaniell or Finder. THe water Spaniell consequently followeth, called in Latine Aquaticus, in English a water Spagnell, which name is compound of two simple words, namely Water, which in Latine soundeth Aqua, wherein he swimmeth. And Spaine, Hispania, the Country from whence they came, not that England wanteth such kind of Dogs, (for they are naturally bred and ingendred in this country,) but because they bear the general and common name of these Dogs since the time they were first brought ouer out of Spaine. And we make a certaine difference in this sort of dogs, either for somthing which in their qualities is to be considered, as for an example in this kind called the Spaniel by the appo∣sition and putting to of this word water, which two coupled together sound water Spani∣ell. He is called a finder, in Latine Inquisitor, because that by serious and secure seeking, he findeth such things as be lost, which word Find in English is that which the latins mean by this verbe Inuenire. This dog hath this name of his property, because the principall point of his seruice consisteth in the premisses. Now leauing the surueiwe of hunting and hawking dogs, it remaineth that we run ouer the residue, whereof some be called, fine dogs, some course, othersome mungrels or Rascals. The first is the Spaniell gentle called Canis Melitaeus, because it is a kind of dog accepted among Gentils, Nobles, Lords, Ladies, &c. who make much of them, vouch∣safing to admit them so farre into their company that they will not onelie lul them in their laps, but kisse them with their lips, and make them their pretty play-fellowes. Such a one was Gorgons little puppy mentioned by Theocritus in Siracusis, who taking his iourney, straightly charged and commaunded his maid to see to his dog as charily and warely as to his childe: To call him in alwaies that he wandred not abroad, as well as to rock the babe asleepe, crying in the cradle. This puppitly and pleasant Curre, (which some frumpingly tearme fysting houndes) serue in a maner to no good vse, except (as we haue made former relation) to succor and strengthen quailing and quamming stomackes, to bewray bawdery, and filthy abhomina∣ble leudnes (which a little Dog of this kinde did in Sicilia ) as Aelianus in his 7. booke of beasts, and 27. chapter recordeth. Of dogs vnder the courser kind, we will deale first with the Shepherds Dog, whome we call the Bandog, the Tydog, or the Mastiue, the first name is imputed to him for ser∣uice, Quoniam pastori famulatur, because he is at the Shepheards his maisters commande∣ment. The second a Ligamento of the band or chaine wherewith hee is tied, The thirde a Sagina, of the fatnes of his body. For this kind of Dog which is vsually tyed, is mighty, grosse, and fat fed. I know this that Augustinus Niphus, calleth this Mastinus (which we call Mastiuus and that Albertus wri∣teth howe the Lyciscus is ingendred by a Beare and a Woolfe. Notwithstanding the selfe same author taketh it for the most parte pro Molosso. A Dog of such a country. Of Mungrels and Rascals somewhat is to be spoken: and among these, of the Wappe or Turnespet, which name is made of two simple wordes, that is, of Turne, which in latine soundeth Vertere, and of spete which is Veru, or spede, for the English word inclineth clo∣ser to the Italian imitation: Veruuersator, Turnespit. He is called also Waupe, of the na∣turall noise of his voice Wau, which he maketh in barking. But for the better and readi∣ner sound, the vowell u, is changed into the consonant P, so that for waupe we say wappe. And yet I wot well that Nonius borroweth his Baubari of the naturall voice Bau, as the Graecians doe their Bautein of wau. Now when you vnderstand this, that Saltare in latine signifieth Dansare in English. And that our Dogge thereupon is called a Daunser, and in the latine Saltator, you are so farre taught as you were desirous to learne: and now I suppose, there remaineth nothing, but that your request is fully acomplished. THus (Friend Gesner ) you haue, not onely the kindes of our countrey Dogges, but their names also, as well in Latine as in English, their Offices, Seruices, Diuersities, Natures, and Properties, that you can demaund no more of me in this matter. And albeit I haue not satisfied your mind peraduenture (who suspectest al speed in the perfor∣mance of your request imploied, to be meere delaies) because I staid the setting forth of that vnperfect pamphlet, which fiue yeares agoe I sent to you as a priuate friend for your owne reading, and not to be printed and so made common, yet I hope (hauing like the Beare lickt ouer my young) I haue waded ouer in this worke to your contentation, which delay hath made somewhat better and Deuterai phrontides, Of the disea∣ses of dogs & their cures. Blondus. after wit more meete to be per∣used. Now it is conuenient to shut vp this treatise of Dogges, with a recitall of their seuerall diseases and cures thereof; for as all other creatures, so that this beast is annoyed with many infirmities. First, therefore if you giue vnto a dog euery seuenth day or twice in se∣uen daies broath or pottage, wherein Iuy is sod, it will preserue him sound without any o∣ther medicine, for this hearbe hath the same operation in Dogs to make wholesom their meat, that it hath in sheepe to clense their pasture. Pliny. Tardinus. The small roots of Ellebor which are like to Onions, haue power in them to purge the belly of Dogs: Other giue them goats-milk, or salt beaten small, or Sea-crabs beaten small and put into water, or Staues-acre, & imediatly after his purgation, sweet milke. If your dog be obstructed and stopped in the belly, which may be discerned by his trembling, sighing, Albertus. and remoouing from place to place, giuen vnto him Oaten meal and water to eat, mingled together and made as thick as a pultisse, or leauened oten-bread, and sometime a little whay to drinke. The ancients haue obserued that Dogs are most annoyed with three diseases, the swel∣ling of the throat, the gowt, and madnes; but the later writers haue obserued many noy∣some infirmities in them. First, they are oftentimes wounded by the teeth of each other, and also of wilde beasts: for cure whereof, Blondus out of Maximus writeth these remedies following: First, let the sinnewes, Fibres, or gistles of the wound be layed togither, then sow vp the lips or vpper skin of the wound with a needle and thred, and take of the haires of the dog which made the wound and lay thereupon, vntil the bleeding be stanched, and so leaue it to the dog to be licked; for nature hath so framed the Dogs tongue, that ther∣by in short space he cureth deepe wounds. And if he cannot touch the sore with his toong▪ then doth he wet his foot in his mouth, Albertus. and so oftentimes put it vpon the maime: or if neither of these can be performed by the beast himselfe, then cure it by casting vpon it the ashes of a dogs heade, or burned salte, mingled with liquid pitch powred therupon. When a dog returning from hunting is hurt about the snowt, Blondus. by the venemous teeth of some wilde beast, I haue seene it cured by ma∣king incision about the wound, whereby the poysoned blood is euacuated, and afterward the sore was annointed with oile of Saint Iohns wort. Wood-worms cureth a dog bitten by serpents. Plinyus. When he is troubled with vlcers or rindes in his skin, pieces of Pot-sheardes beaten to powder and mingled with vineger and Turpentine, with the fat of a Goose; or else waterwort with new Lard, applyed to the sore, easeth the same: and if it swel, anoint it with Butter. For the drawing forth a thorne or splinter out of a Dogs foote, take coltes-foote and Lard, or the pouder there of burned in a new earthen pot, and either of these applyed to the foot, draweth forth the thorne and cureth the sore: for by Dioscorides it is said, to haue force to extract any point of a Speare out of the body of a man. For the wormes which breede in the vlcers of their heeles, take Vnguentum Egiptiacum, and the iuice of peach leaues: There are some very skilfull hunters which affirme, that if you hang about the Dogs necke sticks of Citrine, as the wood drieth, so will the wormes come forth and dy. Again for th s euil they wash the wounds with water, then rub it with pitch, time, and the dung of an Oxe in Vineger; Tardinus. afterward they apply vnto it the powder of Ellebor. When a dog is troubled with the maungie, itch, or Ring-wormes, first let him blood in his fore legs in the greatest veyne, afterward make an ointment of Quick siluer, Brimstone, net∣tle-seed, Albertus. Rasis and twice so much olde sewet or Butter, and therewithal all anoint him, putting thereunto if you please decoction of Hops and salt water. Some do wash maungy Dogs in the Sea-water, and there is a caue in Sicily (saith Gra∣tius ) that hath this force against the scabs of Dogs if they be brought thither, and set in the running water which seemeth to be as thicke as oyle. Flegme or melancholly doth of∣ten engender these euils, and so after one Dog is infected, all the residue that accompa∣ny or lodge with him, are likewise poisoned: for the auoyding thereof, you must giue them Fumitory, Sorrel, and whay sod together, it is good also to wash them in the sea, or in Smiths-water, or in the decoction aforesaid. For the taking awaie of warts from the feet of Dogs or other members, first rub and friccase the wart violently, and afterward anoint it with salt, Oyle, Vineger, and the pow∣der of the rind of a Gourd, or else lay vnto it Alloes beaten with mustard-seed, to eat it off, and afterward lay vnto it the little scories or iron chips, which flie off from the Smithes hotte iron while he beateth it, mingled with Vineger, and it shall perfectly remooue them. Against Tikes, Lyce, and Fleas, annoint the Dogs with bitter Almonds, Staues acre, or Roots of Maple, or Cipers, or froth of Oile and if it be old; and annoint also their ears with Salt-water, and bitter Almondes, then shall not the flies in the Summer time enter into them. If Bees, or Waspes, or such Beasts sting a Dogge, lay to the sore burned Rue, with Water; and if a greater Fly, as the Hornet, let the Water be warmed. A Dog shall be neuer infected with the Plague if you put into his mouth in the time of any common pestilence, Blondus. the powder of a Storks craw, or Ventrickle, or any part thereof with Water: which thing ought to be regarded, (for no creature is so soone infected with the plague as is a Dogge and a Mule) and therefore they must either at the beginning receiue me∣dicine, or else bee remooued out of the ayre, according to the aduise of Gra∣tius: Sed varij mitus nec in omnibus vna potestes, Disce vices & quae tutela est proxima, tenta. Woolfe-wort, Pliny. and Apocynon, whose leaues are like the leaues of Iuye, and smell strongly, will kill all Beasts which are littered blind; as Wolues, Foxes, Beares, and Dogs, if they eat thereof: So likewise will the root of Chamaeleon and Mezereon, in water and oyle, it kil∣leth Mice, Discorides Swine, and Dogs▪ Ellebor, and Squilla, and Faba Lupina, haue the same opera∣tion▪ There is a Gourd (called Zinziber of the Water) because the tast thereof is like to Ginger, the Flower, Fruite, and Leafe thereof killeth Asses, Mules, Dogs, and manie o∣ther Foure-footed beastes. The nuts Vomicae, are poison to Dogges, except their care be cut presently and made to bleed. It will cause them to leape strangely vp and downe, and kill him within two houres after the tasting, if it be not preuented by the former remedy. Theophrastus Chrysippus affirmeth, that the water wherein Sperrage beene sodde gi∣uen to Dogges, killeth them: the fume of Siluer or Leade hath the same opperati∣on. If a Dog grow lean, and not through want of meat, Albertus it is good to fill him twice or thrice with Butter, and if that doe not recouer him, then it is a signe that the worme vnder his tongue annoieth him, (which must be presently pulled out by some Naule or Needle) & if that satisfie not, he cannot liue, but will in short time perish. And it is to be noted, that Oaten bread leauened, will make a sluggish dog to become lusty, agile, and full of spirit. Blondus. Dogs are also many times bewitched, by the onely sight of inchaunters, euen as infants, Lambes, and other creatures, according to Virgils verse; Nescio quis teneros oculus mihi fascinat agnos. For bewitching spirit entereth by the eie into the hart of the party bewitched: for re∣medy whereof, they hang about the necke a chaine of Corrall, as for holy hearbs I hold them vnprofitable. To cure the watry eyes of Dogs, take warme water, and first wash them therewith, and then make a plaister of meale and the white of an Egge, and so lay it thereunto. By rea∣son of that saying, Eccles. 20. cap. Bribes and gifts blind the eies of Iudges, Ʋnicentius. euen as a dumbe dog turneth away Correction. Some haue deliuered, that greene Crow-foote forced into the mouth of a Dog, maketh him dumbe and not able to barke. When a Dog becommeth deafe, the oile of Roses with new pressed wine infused into his eares, cureth him: and for the wormes in the eares, make a plaister of a beaten spunge and the white of an Egge, Tardinus. and that shall cure it. The third kind of Quinancy (called Synanche ) killeth Dogs, Pollux. Niphus. because it bloweth vppe their chaps, and includeth their breath. The cough is very noisome to Dogs, wherefore their keepers must infuse into their Nostrils two cuppes of wine, with brused sweete Al∣monds: but Tardinus for this disease, prescribeth great parceley sod with Oyle, Honey, and Wine, and so giuen to the Dog. For the shortnes of the breath, Blondus. bore him thorough the eare, and if there be any helpe that will preuaile. If a bone sticke in the mouth of a Dog, hold vppe his head backward, and powre Ale into his mouth vntill he cough, and so shall he be eased. When a Dog hath surfetted, and falleth to loth his meat, he eateth the hearbe Canaria and is releeued (both against his sur∣fet and also the bitings of Serpents.) For the wormes in the belly, he eateth wheate in the stalke. The gowt maketh the Dogs legs grow crooked, and it is neuer so cured, but that af∣ter a course or two they grow lame againe. When his skin flyeth from his nailes, take meale & water & bind them therunto for a remedie; and these are for the most part, those diseases wherewithall dogs are infected, and the other are either cured by heat, or by ea∣ting of grasse: and so for this part, I conclude both the sicknes and cure of dogs, with the saying of Gratius: Mille tement pestes curaque potentia maior. Concerning the madnes of dogs, and their venemous bitings, we are now to speake: Of the bitīgs of mad dogs and their curs. and first of al, no reasonable man ought to doubt, why the teeth of a mad dog should do more harme then of a sound and healthy one; because in rage and anger, the teeth of euery beast and creature, receiue venome and poison from the head (as it is well obserued by Aegineta ) and so at that time fastning their teeth, they do more harm then at other times. Against the simple biting of a dog, it is sufficient to vse but the vrine of a dog, for there is not much venome in those wounds, and the vrine also wil draw out the prickles of a hedg∣hog, because such wounds haue in them but little poyson. Also (as Aetius prescribeth) it is very Soueraigne in such wounds: first of all to couer and rub the sore with the palme of ones hand, and then powre into it Vineger and Nitre, so as it may discend to the bot∣tome of the wound, and afterward lay vnto it a new spunge wetted in the same Vineger & nitre, and let it be so continued for the space of three daies, and by the working thereof it shal be whole. Also it is generally to be obserued in all the bitings of men by Dogs, that first of all it is requisite, that the wound be well rubbed ouer by the palme of the hand with Vineger, then poure into the wounds, vineger mixed with water or with nitre, laying also a spunge thereupon, and so bind it vpon the place, hauing first wetted the cloathes wherewithall you bind it with the said vineger mixed, so let it remaine bound vp three daies together, and afterward follow the common course of curing, as in euery vulgar woundes, or else, lay thereunto pellitory of the wall, mingled and beaten with salt, changing it euery day, vntill the crust or vpper skin thereof fall away. It is also good sometimes the holes being small, to wet Lint in vineger, and to purge the wound with pouder of Annisse-seed, or Cumin; laying the Lint vpon the Annisse for two or three daies. The same being thus purged, take a medicine of the equall partes of Hony, Turpentine, Butter, Goose-greace, Marrow of a Hart, or Calfe, melted betwixt the teeth of a man, and lay it thereunto, for it also cureth the bitinges of men: but if the sore be inflamed, then lay vnto it, Lentils sod with the parings of apples and dried, or the crummes of bred with the iuyce of beetes, and a little oyle of Roses, made like a plai∣ster. Diuers Authors haue also prescribed these outward medicines against the bitinges of Dogs in generall, namely Vineger spunged, the lees of Vineger, with Nigella Romana, Venus haire, Alablaster, Brine with Lint, Garlicke mixed with hony and taken into the bo∣dy, Lees of Wine, Almonds both sweet and bitter mingled with Hony, dried Annisse-seeds burned, the leaues of blacke Hore-hound or Archangell beaten with salt, scallions with Hony and Pepper of the case, the iuyce of Onions with Rue and Hony, or raw O∣nions with Hony and Vineger, but sod ones with hony & wine, (if they be green) let them lie to the wound three dayes: the ashes of Vine-trees with oyle, ashes of a figtree with a seare-cloath, beside infinite other elaborate medicines, drawne from Trees, Fruits, fields, Gardens, and all other creatures as if nature had onely strouen to prouide sundry ready cures for this euill aboue all other. Leauing therefore the simple bitings of Dogs, let vs proceed to the madnesse of Dogs and their bitings, wherein the greater danger must be considered, with greater circum∣spection of remedies. First therfore, the ancients haue deriued Rabiem, of Rauiem, mad∣nesse, of the hoarsnes of voice, (because a Dog at that time hath no perfect voice.) But it is more probable, that Rabies commeth of Rapiendo, because when a Dog beginneth to be oppressed heerewith, he biteth, snatcheth, runneth too and is fro, and is carryed from home and Maister, to his owne perdition: this by the Graecians is called Lytta, and Cynolossos. By this euill, not onely Dogs perish, but all other creatures (except a Goose) bitten by them: and a man doth not escape without great perill. For Albertus relateth a story, of a man whose arme was bitten by a mad Dog, and after twelue yeares the sore brake forth a∣gaine, and he died within two dayes; and the reason heerof was (as in all likelihood that of Coelius ) that when one and the same nature infecteth each other, as Dogs do Dogs, and men do men, then by reason of their similitude and naturall sympathy, they receiue the consuming poyson with all speed: but if another nature infect that, betwixt whom in in∣clination and passion, there is a dissimilitude & Antipathy (as is betwixt a dog and a man) then will the poison receiue greater opposition, and bee so much the longer be∣fore it receiue predominant operation, because the first ouercommeth nature by trea∣son, against which there is no resistaunce; and the s cond by open force and proclama∣tion of Warre, against which all the strength and force of nature is combined and oppo∣sed. Heereof also it came to passe, that the Noble Lawyer Baldus, playing with his Dog at Trent, Mathaeolus. A History of the death of Baldus. was bitten by him in his lip, and neglecting the matter (because he neuer suspected the Dogs madnes) after foure moneths the poison wrought vppon him, and he perished miserably. Those Beastes which haue teeth like sawes, (as Dogges, Wolues, and Foxes) goe madde by nature, without the bitinges of others, but those which haue no such teeth (as Asses and Mules,) fall not madde at any time vntill they be bitten by other. Mishal Ephe¦s us. Also it hath bene obserued, that sometimes a mad dog hath bitten, Aug. Niphus and there hath follo∣wed no harme at all, whereof this was the reason, because poison is not equally in all his teeth; and therefore biting with the purer and wholsomer, the wound became not peril∣lous. A man bitten with a mad Dogge, falleth mad presently when he commeth vnder the shadow of a Corn-tree; as it is affirmed by most Phisitians, Ponzettus. for that shaddow setteth the poyson on fire: but a man falling mad, of all creatures auoydeth a Dog, and a Dog most of all falleth vpon men. There are many things which engender madnes in Dogs, as hot wheaten bread dipped in beane-water, melancholy bred within them and not purged by Canaria or other Hearbes, the menstruous pollutions of Women, and the paine of his teeth. Their madnesse is most dangerous in the Dog-daies, for then they both kil and pe∣rish mortally, for at that time their spittle or fome, falling vppon mans body, Pliny. Do daies most perilous for mad dog breedeth great daunger; and that if a man tread vpon the Vrine of a mad Dog, he shall feele paine by it if he haue a sore about him: from whence it came to passe, that a stone bitten by such a Dog, was a common prouerbe of discord. Also it is obserued, that if a wound be dres∣sed in the presence of man or woman, which hath beene bitten by a madde Dog, that the paine thereof wil be encreased: and which is more, that abortment wi l follow vpon beasts with young, or Egs couered by the hen, by their presence: But for remedy, Pliny. they wash their hands and sprinckle themselues, or the Beasts with that water, whereby the euill is to be cured. If the gall of a mad Dog, about the bignes of a Lentill seed be eaten, it killeth within se∣uen daies, or else doth no harme at all, if it passe seuen daies without operation. Bortrutius. When a mad Dog had suddenlie tore in peeces a garment about ones body, the taylor or Bot her tooke the same to mend, and forgetting himself, put on side of the breach into his mouth to stretch it out to the other, & fell mad immediately. Men thus affected, feare al waters, their virile member continually standeth, they suffer many conuulsions, and oftentimes barke like dogs. There was a certaine Mason at Zuricke, who had his finger greeuously bitten with a madde Dog about Iuly, whereunto he layed Garlicke, Rue, and oile of Scorpions▪ and so it seemed to be healed, wherefore he tooke no counsell of any Phisiti n. About August following, he was taken with a feuer, being first very cold, then very hot, and so continu∣ed sweating for a day or two, and could not endure the cold aire. He thirsted much, yet when water or drinke was brought him, he was so afraid thereof that he could not drinke: his sweat was cold, and when he felt any colde ayre, hee cried out for feare it had bin wa∣ter, thus he remained trembling, and offering to vomit at the sight of water, many times howling, and so perished after two daies ended. When a Dog is mad it may be knowne by these signes, for he will neither eat nor drink, Signs to kno a mad Do ▪ he looketh awry and more sadly then ordinary; his body is leane, he casteth foorth thicke fleame out of his Nostrils or mouth: He breathe h gaping, and his toong hangeth out of his mouth. His eares is limber and weake, his taile hangeth downeward: his pace is hea∣uy and sluggish vntil he run, and then it is more rash, intemperate and vncertaine. Some∣times running, and presently after stand still againe: he is verie thirsty but yet abstaineth from drinke, he barketh not, and knoweth no man, biting both strangers and friends. His head hangeth downeward, Bertrurius. Ponzettus. he is fearefull and runneth into secret places from his whelps or fellowes, who often barke at him and will not eat of bread vppon which his blood hath fallen. His eies grow very red, hee many times dieth for feare of water: some discerne it by laying nuts or Graines of corne to the bitten place, and afterward take them away and cast them to Hens or Pullen, who for hunger will eate them, and if after the eating the fowle liue, the dog wil not be mad; but if it die, then for certaintie the dog will fall mad. The which passions do also agree with them that are bitten by him, and it is not to be for∣gotten that the bitings of the female, bring more danger then the males. The bodies of them that are thus wounded grow very dry and are pressed with inward burning fe ers, if by musicke and delightfull sports they be not kept waking; many times they die suddenly, or els recouer for a small time, and then fall into a relapsed malady. Some giue this to be the cause of their feare of Water, because their body growing dry seemeth to forget all participation with humidity, but Rufus affirmeth, this commeth from melancholy, wherewithall these persons are most commonly affected: which agreeth with an imagination they haue, that they see Dogs in the water, and indeed it cannot be but their owne countenance, which in these passions is very red, doth woon∣derfully afflict them: both in the water, and in all looking glasses. When a certaine Philosopher (being bitten by a mad dog) entered into a bath, and a strong apparition of a Dog presented it selfe vnto him therein, Aetius. he stroue against this ima∣gination with a singuler confident corage to the contrary, saying, within himselfe. Quid cani commune est cum balneo, what hath a Dog to do in a Bath? and so went in and ouercam his disease: which thing had sildome chanced, that a man hath recouered this malady af∣ter hee fell into feare and trembling, except Eudemus and Themiso, who obeying the re∣quest of a friend of his, entered likewise into the Water, and after many torments was re∣couered. To conclude, some men in this extremity suffer most fearefull dreames, profusion of seed, hoarsnes of voice, shortnes of breath, retention of vrine, which also changeth co∣lour, being sometimes blacke, sometime like milke, sometime thicke, sometime thin as water, rumbling in the belly, by reason of crudity, rednes of the whole body, distention of nerues, heauines of mind, loue of darkenes, and such like. Yet doth not this operation appeare presently vpon the hurt, but sometimes at nine dayes, sometimes at forty daies, sometimes at halfe a yeare, or a yeare, or seuen, or twelue yeare, as was hath beene already said. The cure of mad Dogs ey¦ther for pre∣u nting or e¦couering. Pliny. For the cure of these Dogges, and first of all for the preuenting of madnes, there are sundry inuented obsuerations. First, it is good to shut them vp, and make them to fast for one day; then purge them with Hellebor, and being purged, nourish them with breade of barley-meale. Other take them when they be young whelpes, and take out of their tongue a certaine little worme, which the Graecians call Lytta ; after which time they neuer grow mad or fall to vomitting, as Gratius noted in these verses; Namque subit nodis qua lingua renascibus haeret Verunculum dixere, mala atque incondita pestis Iam teneris elementa mali, causasque recidunt. But immediatly it being taken forth, they rub the tongue with salt and oyle Columella tea∣cheth that Shepheards of his time, took their Dogs tailes, and pulled out a certaine nerue or sinnew, which commeth from the Articles of the backe bone into their tailes, whereby they not onely kept the taile from growing deformed and ouerlong, but also constantly beleeued, Pliny. that their Dogs could neuer afterward fall madde: whereunto Pliny agreeth, calling it a castration or gelding of the taile, adding, that it must be done before the dog be forty daies old▪ Some againe say, that if a Dog tast of a womans milke which she giueth by the birth of a boy, he will neuer fall mad. Nemesian ascribeth the cure heerof to Casto∣reum dried and put into milke, but this is to be vnderstoode of them that are already mad, whose elegant verses of the cause, beginning, and cure of a ruad dog, I haue thoght good heere to expresse. Exhalat seu terra siuus seu noxius aer Causa male, seu cum gelidus non sufficit humor. Torrida per venas concrescunt semina flammae. Whatsoeuer it be he thus warranteth the cure. Tunc virosa tibi sumes, multumque domabis Castorea adtritu silicis lentescere coges. Exebore huc trito puluis, lectore feratur A miscens{que} diu, facies concrescere vtrunque Mox lactis liquidos sensim superadde fluores Vt non cunctantes, haustos infundere cornu Inserto possis, furiasque repellere tristes. Armetia a ing of Valentia, Albertus prescribeth this forme for the cure of this euill: let the Dog be put into the Water▪ so as the hinderlegs doe onely touch the ground, and his forelegs be tyed vp like hands ouer his head, and then being taken againe out of the wa∣ter, let his haire be shaued off, that he may be pieled vntill he bleede: then annoynt him with oyle of Beetes, and if this do not cure him within seuen daies, then let him be knocked on the head, or hanged out of the way. When a young male Dog suffereth madnesse, shut him vp with a Bitch; Blondus. or if a young Bitch be also oppressed, shut her vp with a Dog, and the one of them will cure the madnes of the other. But the better part of this labor, is more needeful to be emploid about the curing of men, or other creatures which are bitten by dogs, then in curing or preuenting that naturall in∣firmity. Wherefore it is to be remembred, that all other poysoned wounds are cured by incision and circumcising of the flesh, and by drawing plaisters, The cure of a mā or be st bitten by a mad Dogge. which extract the ve∣nom out of the flesh and comfort nature; and by cupping-glasses, or burning yrons (as Coelius affirmeth) vpon occasion of a miraculous fiction of the Temple doore key of S. Bellinus, neere Rhodigium ; for it was belieued, that if a mad man could hold that key in his hand red whot, he should be deliuered from his fittes for euer. There was such another charme or incantantion among the Apuleians, made in forme of a prayer against all bitinges of madde Dogges, and other poysons, vnto an obscure Saint (called Vithus ) which was to be saide three satterdaies in the euening, nyne times together, which I haue heere set downe for no other cause but to shewe their extreame folly. A foolish charme and prayer to vi∣thus. Alme vithe pellicane Littusque polygnanicum Irasque canum mitigas Rictusque canis luridos Oram qui tenes Apulam. Qui morsus rabidos leuas Tu sancte rabiem asperam Tu saeuam prohibbe luem. I procul hinc rabies, procul hinc furor omnis abesto. But to com to the cure of such as haue bin bitten by mad dogs: First I will set down some compound medicins to be outwardly aplyed to the body: secondly, some simple or vn∣compounded medicines: In the third place such compounded and vncompounded poti∣ons, as are to be taken inwardly agaist this poyson. Discoride For the outward compound remedies, a plaister made of Opponax and pitch, is much commended, which Menippus vsed, taking a pound of Pitch of Brutias, and foure ounces of Opponax (as Aetius and Actuarius doe prescribe) adding withall, that the Opponax must be dissolued in vineger, and afterward, the Pitch and that vineger must be boyled toge∣ther, and when the vineger is consumed, then put in the Opponax, and of both together make like taynters of splints and thurst them into the wound, so let them remaine many dayes together, and in the meane time drinke an antidot of sea-crabs and vineger, (for vi∣neger is alway pretious in this confection.) Other vse Basilica, Onyons, Rue, Salt, ruste of Iron, white bread, seedes of horehound, and triacle: but the other plaister is most for∣cible to be applyed outwardly, aboue al medicines in the world. For the simple or vncompounded medicines to be taken against this sore, are many: As Goose-grease, Garlike, the roote of Wilde roses drunke; bitter almonds, leaues of chickweed, or pimpernell, the old skinne of a snake pounded with a male-sea-crab, Beto∣ny, Cabbage leaues, or stalkes, with persneps and vineger, lime and sewet, poulder of Sea-crabs with Hony; poulder of the shels of Sea-crabs, the haires, of a Dog, layed vp∣on the wound, the head of the Dog which did bite, mixed with a little Euphorbium ; the haire of a man with vineger, dung of Goates with Wine, Walnuts with Hony and salte, poulder of figtree in a scarcloath, Fitches in wine, Euphorbium ; warme horse-dung, raw beanes chewed in the mouth, figtree leaues, greene figs with vineger, fennel stalkes, Gen∣tiana, dung of pullen, the Lyuer of a Buck-goate, young Swallowes burned to poulder, also their dung; to vrine of a man, an Hyaenas skin, flower-deluce with hony, a Sea hearb called Kakille, Silphum with salt, the flesh and shels of snayles, leeke seeds with salt, mints, the taile of a field-mouse cut off from her aliue and she uffered to liue, rootes of Burres, with salt of the Sea plantine, the tongue of a Ramme with salt, the flesh of al Sea-fishes, the fat of a sea-calfe and veruine, beside many other superstitious amulets which are vsed to be bound to the Armes, neckes, and brests, as the Canine tooth bound vp in a leafe and tyed to the Arme. A Worme bred in the dung of Dogges hanged about the necke, the roote of Gentian in an Hyaenaes skin, or young Wolfes skin, and such like; whereof I know no reason beside the opinion of men. The inward compound potions or remedies against the bitings of Dogs may be such as these. Take Sea-crabs, and burne them with twigs of white vines, and saue their ashes, then put to them the poulder of Gentian roote well clensed, and small beaten, and as oft as neede requireth take two spoonefuls of the first, and one of the second, and put them into a Cup of pure and vnmixed wine, and so drink it for foure daies together, being well beaten and stirred, so as the Wine be as thicke as a Cawdell; and there is nothing more forcible then Sea-crabs, Hiera, Diascincum, poulder of Walnuts in warme raine Water, Triacle, Castoreum, pilles, spurge-seede, and a decoction of Indian thorne with veruine gi∣uen in water. These may serue for seuerall compound inward remedies against these poy∣sons, and now follow the simple. First eating of garlike in our meate, drinking of wormwood, rams flesh burned and put into wine and so drunk. There is an hearb called Alysson, by reason of the power it hath a∣gainst this euill, which being bruised and drunke, cureth it. The liuer of a Boare dried and drunk in wine, hath the same operation. Iewes lime drunk in water, leeks & onions in meat, dogs blood, the head, the vaine vnder the tongue (commonly supposed to be a worme,) and the liuer of the dog which hath don the hurt, are also prescribed for a remedy of this euill: but especially the liuer or rennet of a young puppy, the rinde of a Wilde figtree, a d am of Castoreum with oyle of roses Centaury, or Chamaeleon ; the roote of a wild rose (cal∣led Cynorrhodon and Cynosbaton) Ellebor, the braine of a hen drunke in some liquor, sorrel, Hony, mints, and plantine: but Pimpinella Germanica is giuen to all cattell which are bit¦ten by a mad Dog. Besides many other such like, which for breuity sake I omit, conclu∣ding against all superstitious curing by inchantments or supposed miracles, such as is in a certaine church of S. Lambert in a citty of Picardye, where the masse priestes, when a man is brought vnto them hauing this euill, they cut a crosse in his forehead, and lay vpon the wound a piece of S. Lamberts stole burning, (which they say (though falesely) is reserued to this day without diminution) then do they sow vp the wound again, & lay another plai∣ster vpon it, prescribing him a diet; which is to drink water, and to eat hard Egs, but if the party amend not within forty daies, they binde him hand and foote in his bed, and laying another bed vpon him, there strangle him (as they thinke without all sinne) and for pre∣uentings of much harme that may come by his life▪ if ee should bite another. This sto∣ry is related by Alysius, and it is worth the noting, how murther accompanieth superstiti∣ous humane inuentions, and the vaine presumptuous confidence of crosse-worshippers: and thus much of the madnesse of dogs, and the cure thereof in men and beasts. In the next place, the conclusion of this tedious discourse followeth, which is, the naturall medicines arising out of the bodyes of dogs, and so wee will tye them vp for this time. The naturall medicines Whereas the inward partes of men are troubled with many euils, it is deliuered for truth, that if little Melitaean Dogs, or young sucking puppies, be layed to the brest of a child or man that hath infectious passions or pains in his entrals, the paine wil depart from the man into the beast; for which cause they burned them when they were dead. Serenus doth expresse this very elegantly saying; Q in etiam catulum lactentem apponere membris Conuenit, omne malum transcurrere fertur in illum. Cui tamen extincto munus debetur humandi, Humanos quia contactus mala tanta sequntur, Et iunctus vitium ducit de coniuge coniux. Amatus If a Whelpe be cut asunder aliue, and layed vpon the head of a mad melancholike Wo∣man, it shall help her, and it hath the same power against the spleene. If a woman growe barren after she hath borne children, Hippocrates let her eate young Whelp-flesh, and Polypus fishe sod in Wine and drinke the broath, and she shall haue ease of all infirmities in her sto∣mach and wombe. Furnerius Water destilled out of Whelpes, causeth that pieled or shauen places shall neuer more haue haire grow vpon them. With the fat of whelps, bowelled and sod til the flesh come from the bones, & then taken and put into another vessell, and the weake, resolute, or paralitike members being there∣with anoynted, they are much eased if not recouered. Alysius saith, he made experience of puppies sod aliue in oyle, whereby he cured his gouty legd horses, and therefore it can∣not chuse but be much more profitable for a man. The skin of a dog held with the fiue fingers, stayeth distillations; it hath the same operati∣on in gloues and stockins, and it will also ease both Ache in the belly, head, and feet, and therefore it is vsed to be worne in the shooes against the gout. Pliny. The flesh of madde Dogges, is salted and giuen in meate to them which are bitten by mad Dogs for a singular remedy. The blood is commended against all intoxicating poy∣sons and paines in the small guts, and it cureth scabs. The fat is vsed against deafenesse of the eares, the gout, nits in the head, and incontinency of vrine, giuen with Alumme. A plaister made of the marrow of a Dog and old wine, is good against the falling of the fun∣dament. The haire of a blacke Dog easeth the falling sicknesse, the braines of a Dog in linte and Wooll layed to a mans broken bones for foureteene dayes together, doeth consolidate and ioyne them together again, which thing caused Serenus to make these ex∣cellent verses: Infandum dictu cunctis procull absit amicis Sed fortuna potens omen conuertat in hostes Vis indigna noue si sparserit ossa fragore, Conuentet cerebrum blandi canis addere fractis Lintea deinde superque inductu nectere lauas Saepius & succos conspergere pinguis oliui Bis septem credunt reuatescere cuncta diebus. The braine-pan or scul of a Dog cloue asunder, is aplied to heale the paine in the eies; that is, if the right eie bee grieued, thereunto apply the right side of the scull, if the left eie, the left side. The vertues of a Dogs head made into poulder are both many and vnspeakeable▪ by it is the biting of mad Dogs cured, it cureth spots and bunches in the head, and a plaister thereof made with Oyle of Roses, healeth the running in the head: it cureth also tu∣mours in the priuy parts, and in the seate, the chippings in the fingers, and many other diseases. The poulder of the teeth of Dogges, maketh Childrens teeth to come forth with speed and easie, and if their gums be rubd with a dogs tooth, it maketh them to haue the sharper teeth: and the poulder of these Dogs teeth rubbed vpon the Gummes of young or olde, caseth tootache and abateth swelling in the gummes. The tongue of a Dogge, is most wholesome both for the curing of his owne woundes by licking, as also of any other crea∣tures. The rennet of a Puppy drunke with Wine, dissolueth the Collicke in the same houre wherein it is drunke: Rasis Sextus and the vomit of a Dog layed vpon the belly of a hydropick man, causeth Water to come forth at his stoole. The gall healeth all wheales and blisters after they be pricked with a Needle, and mingled with Hony it cureth pain in the eies, and taketh away white spots from them: likewise infused into the eares, openeth all stoppings, Pliny. Aesculapius reth all inward paines in them. The Spleene drunke in vrine, cureth the spleenatick; the melt being taken from the Dog aliue, hath the same vertue to help the melt of man. The skinne of Bitches wherein they conceiue their puppies (which neuer touched the earth) is pretious against difficulty in childbirth, and it draweth the infant out of the wombe. Dioscorid The milk of a Bitches first whel∣ping, is an antidote against poyson, and the same causeth haire neuer to come againe, if it be rubbed vpon the place where haires are newly pulled off: Also infused into the eyes, driueth away the whitenes of them. Likewise there is no better thing to annoint the gums of young Children withall, before they haue teeth, for it maketh them to come forth with ease: it easeth likewise the paine of the eares, and withall speed healeth burnt mouthes by any whot meate, Ora ambusta cibo sanabis lacte canino. The vrine of a dog taketh away spots and wartes, and being mingled with salt of nitre, wonderfully easeth the Kings euill. The dung of dogges (called by the Apothecaryes Album Graecum ) because the white is best, being engendered by eating of bones, and therefore hath no ill sauour, Galen affirmeth that his maisters in Physicke, vsed it against old sores, bloody flixes, and the Quinensie, and it is verye profitable to staunche the blood of Dogs, and also against inflamations in the brests of Women, mingled with tur∣pentine. It was well prescribed by Auicen, to expell congeled bloode out of the sto∣macke and bladder, being taken thereof so much in powder as will lye vppon a Golden Noble. Of the Ethiopian Eale. T Here is bred in Ethiopia a certaine strange Beast about the bignesse of a Sea-horse, being of colour blacke or brownish: it hath the cheekes of a Boare, Pliny. Solinus the tayle of an Elephant, and hornes aboue a Cubit long, which are mooueable vpon his head at his owne pleasure like eares; now stand∣ing one way, and anone mouing another way, as hee needeth in fighting with other Beastes, for they stand not stiffe but bend flexibly, and when he fighteth, he al∣way stretcheth out the one, and holdeth in the other, of purpose as it may seeme, that if one of them be blunted and broken, then hee may defend himselfe with the other. It may well be compared to a Sea-horse for aboue all other places it loueth best the Wa∣ters. OF THE ELEPHANT. The great v of the cō¦sideration of an Elephant. T Here is no creature among al the Beasts of the world which hath so great and ample demonstration of the power and wisedome of almighty God as the Elephant: both for pro∣portion of body and disposition of spirit; and it is admira∣ble to behold, the industry of our auncient forefathers, and noble desire to benefit vs their posterity, by serching into the qualities of euery Beast, to discouer what benefits or harmes may come by them to mankind: hauing neuer beene afraid either of the Wildest, but they tamed them; the fiercest, but they ruled them; and the greatest, but they also set vpon them. Witnesse for this part the Elephant, being like a liuing Mountain in quantity & outward appearance, yet by them so handled, as no little dog became more seruiceable and tractable. The first mā in Europ pos¦sessour of ele¦phants. Pausanius Plutarch. Among all the Europaeans the first possessor of Elephants, was Alexander Magnus, and after him Antigonus, and before the Macedonians came into Asia, no people of the world except the Affricans and the Indians, had euer seene Elephants. When Fabritius was sent by the Romanes to King Pyrrhus in Ambassage, Pyrrhus offered to him a great summe of money, to preuent the Warre, but he refused priuate gaine, and preferred the seruice of his Country: the next day he brought him into his presence, and thinking to terrifie him placed behind him a great Elephant, shadowed with cloth of Arras; the cloth was drawne and the huge beast instantly layed his trunke vppon the head of Fabritius, sending forth a terrible and direfull voice: whereat Fabritius laughing, perceiuing the pollicy of the king gently made this speech; Neque heri aurum neque hodie bestia me promouit. I was neither tempted with thy Gold yesterday, nor terrified with the sight of this beast too day : and so afterward Pyrrhus was ouercome in War by the Romans, and Manlius Curius Den∣tatus, Eutropius did first of all bring Elephants in Tryumphe to Rome, calling them Lucanae Bo es, Oxen of the wood, about the 472. year of the Citty: and afterward in the year of Romes building 502. when Metellus was high priest, and ouerthrew the Carthagenian in Sicily, there were 142. Elephants brought in ships to Rome and led in triumph, which Lucius Piso afterward, to take away from the people opinions of the feare of them, caused them to be brought to the stage to open view and handling, and so slaine; which thing Pompey did also by the slaughter of fiue hundred Lyons and Elephants together: so that in the time of Gordianus, Iulius Capit: it was no wonder to see thirty and two of them at one time. An Elephant is by the Haebrewes called Behemah, by way of excellency, as the Latines for the same cause cal him Bellua, Of the seue∣ral names in diuers langua¦ges. the Chaldeans for the same word, Deu. 14. translat Beira, the Arabians Behitz, the Persians Behad, and the Septuagints Ktene, but the Graecians vulgarly Elephas, not Quasi elebas, because they ioine copulation in the Water, but rather from the Haebrew word Dephill ; signifieng the Iuory tooth of an Elephant (as Munster wel obserueth.) The Haebrewes also vse the word Schen for an Elephants tooth. Moreouer Hesychius called an Elephant in the Greek tongue Perissas, the Latines doe indifferently vse Elephas, and Elephantus ; and it is said that Elephantus in the Punicke tongue, signifieth Caesar : wherupon when the Graundfather of Iulius Caesar had slain an Elephant, he had the name of Caesar put vpon him. The original of the Caesars The Italians call this Beast Leofante, or Lionfante, the French Elephante, the Germans Helfant, the Illirians Slon. We read but of three appellatiue names of Elephants; that is of one, called by Alexander the great Aiax, because hee had read that the buckler of great Aiax was couered with an Elephants skin, about whose necke he put a Golden col∣lar and so sent him away with liberty. Antiochus one of Alexander successours had two Ele∣phants, one of them he likewise called Aiax, in imitation of Alexander, and the other Pa∣troclus, of which two this story is reported by Antipater. That when Antiochus came to a certaine foorde or deepe Water, Aiax which was alway the captaine of the residue, ha∣uing sounded the depth thereof, refused to passe ouer, and turned backe againe, then the King spake to the Elephants & pronounced, that he which would passe ouer should haue principality ouer the residue: whereupon, Patroclus gaue the aduenture, and passed ouer safely, and receiued from the king the siluer trappings and al other prerogatiues of princi∣pality; the other seeing it (which had alway beene chiefe till that time,) preferred death before ignominy and disgrace, and so would neuer after eate meate but famished for sor∣row. They are bred in the whot Esterne countries, for by reason they can endure no cold, they keepe onely in the East and South. Countries of the breed of Elephant . Among all, the Indian Elephants are greatest, strong∣est, and tallest, and there are among them of two sorts, one greater (which are called Pra∣sij ) the other smaller, Diodorus called Taxilae. ) They be also bred in Africa, in Lybia, much greater then a Nysaean Horsse,, Aelianu and yet euery way inferiour to the Indian ; for which cause, if an Affrican Elephant do but see an Indian, he trembleth, and laboureth by all meanes to get out of his sight, Philostratus Solinus as being guilty of their owne weakenesse. There are Elephants also in the Ile Taprobane, and in Sumatra, in Affrican. They are bred in Lybia, in Aethiopia, among the Trogloditae, and in the Mountaine Atlas, Syrtes, Zames, Vertomannus and Sala, the seuen Mountaines of Tingitania, and in the Countrey of Basman, subiect to the great Cham. Some Authors affirme, that the Affrican Elephants are much greater then the Indian, Leo Afer Paul venetus but with no greater reason then Columella Writeth; that there bee as great beastes found in Italy as Elephants are: whereunto no sound Author euer yealded. Of all earthly creatures an Elephant is the greatest: for in India they are nine cubits high, The heigh & stature of ele¦phants. and fiue cubits broad; in Affrica foureteen or fifteene ful spans, which is about ele∣uen foot high and proportionable in bredth, which caused Aelianus to Write, that one Elephant is as big as three Bugils; and among these the males are euer greater then the females. In the kingdome of Melinda in Affricke, there were two young ones, not aboue sixe monthes old, whereof the least was as great as the greatest Oxe, but his flesh was as much as you shall find in two Oxen; the other was much greater. Vartomannus The colour and seuerall parts. Their colour is for the most part mouse-colour, or blacke; and there was one all white in Ethiopia : The skinne looketh pieled and scabby; it is most hard on the backe, but softer vnderneath the belly, hauing no couering of haire or gristes nor yet helpe by his taile to driue away the flies, Of the vse of his skinne. Pliny. for that euill doth this beast feele in his great body, but alway hath creuises in his skinne, which by their sauour doe inuite the little flyes to a continuall feast, but when by stretching forth they haue receiued the swarmes, by shrinking together a∣gain, they inclose the flies and so kill them: so that these creuises in his skin, are vnto him insteede of a mane, taile, and haire: yet there are some few haires which grow scattering vppon his hide, whereof some haue beene brought out of America into Germany, which were two palmes long, but not so stiffe as Swines. Their skinne is so hard and stiffe, that a sharpe sworde or iron cannot pierce it. Gillius Their head is very great, and the head of a man may as easily enter into their mouth, as a finger into the mouth of a Dog; but yet their eares and eyes are not aequiualent to the residew of their proportion: for they are smal, like the wings of a Bat or a Dragon, those of the E∣thiopian Sambri want eares altogither. Their eyes are like the eyes of Swine, but very red, Pliny. they haue teeth of either side foure, wherewith they grinde their meate like meale, and they haue also two other which hang forth beyond the residue, in the males downeward, Ʋartomanus and these are the greater and crooked; but in the females vpwarde, and they are the smaller and straight: the one of them they keepe alway sharpe, to reuenge iniuries, and with the other they root vp plants & trees for their meat: of their teeth Aelianus so that nature hath armed both sexes with these, for their chiefest defence; and with these the females are calued at the first, and indued from the mothers belly, and appear so soone as they come foorth: the males not so quickly, but rather after the maner of bores and Sea-horsses, Gillius. Pliny. they hang out of their mouths, and grow to be ten foot long, whereof they make posts of houses in some countries, and cal them Ebora, that is, young yuory: which caused Martial to write thus; Grandia taurorum portant qui corpora quaeris An lybicas possint sustinnisse trabes. There is a certaine booke extant without the name of the Author, written of Iudaea or the holy land, wherein the Author affirmeth that he saw an Elephants tooth sold to a Venetian Merchant, for six and thirty Duccats, it being fourteen spans long, and four spans broad, and it waighed so heauy, that he could not moue it from the ground. Vartomanus also saith, that he saw in the Isle of Sumatra, two Elephants teeth, which waig∣hed three hundred six and thirty pounds. This is certain, that the teeth of those Elephants which liue in the marishes and watry places, are so smooth and harde, as they seeme in∣tractable, and in some places they haue holes in them, and againe certaine bunches as big as hail-stones, which are so hard, as no art or instrument can worke vpon them. The Elephants of the mountaines haue lesser and whiter teeth, fit to be applied to any worke, but the best of all, are the teeth of the Campestriall and fielde Elephants, Philostratus which are whitest and softest, and maye well bee handleth without all paine. The teeth of the female are more pretious then of the male, and these they loose euery tenth yeare; which falling off they bury and couer in the earth, pressing them downe by sitting vppon them, and then heal them ouer with earth by their feet, and so in short time the grasse gro∣weth vpon them: for, as when they are hunted they know it is for no other cause then their teeth, so also when they loose their teeth, they desire to keepe them from men, least the vertues of them being discouered, they which beare them shoulde enioy the lesse peace and security. It is admyrable what deuises the people of India and Affrica haue inuented by naturall obseruation, to finde out these buried teeth, The finding of hidden teeth. which vnto vs liuing in the remote partes of the world, we would iudge impossible by any ordinary or lawfull course, except we should turne vp the earth of a whole country, or go to work by diabolicall coniuration: Aelianus yet haue they found out this facile & ready course. In the woods or fields where they suspect these teeth to be buried, they bring forth pots or bottels of water, and disperse them heere one, there another, and so let them stand, and tarry to watch them, so one sleepeth, another sin∣geth, or bestoweth his time as he pleaseth, after a little time, they go and look in their pots and if the teeth lie neer their bottels, by an vnspeakable and secret attractiue power in na∣ture, they draw all the water out of them that are neere them, which the watchman taketh for a sure signe, and so diggeth about his Bottell, till he find the tooth: a wonderfull natural secret but if their bottels be not emptied, they remoue to seeke in another place. These yuory teeth haue bene alway of great estimation among all the Nations that e∣uer knew them, the Ethyopians payed for a tribute vnto the king of Persia euery 3. yeare twenty or these teeth hung about with gold and Iet-wood. These are sold by waight, and there be many which deceiue the world with the bones of fishes insteed hereof, but the true yuory is paler and heauier, and falling vpon the ground will easily breake, whereas the bones of Fishes are more tenatious, light, and strong. It is like to the Chernites, where∣in Darius was entombed, and the Marble called Lapis Coraliticus Corrol stone: like vnto this is the Alagi stone, and the Paederos Iewell. With this yuory they made images and sta∣tues for their idoll Goddes, as one for Pallas in Athens, for Esculapius in Epidaurus of Ve∣nus vnder the name of Vrania by Phidius, whereupon she was called Elephantina, for Apol∣lo at Rome : and therefore Pausanias wondereth at the Graecians that spared no cost for the vaine worship of their Goddes, for they bought of the Indians and Ethiopians yuory to make their images with more pompe and ostentation: besides of yuory they make the hafts of kniues, and also the best combs, and Salomon as appeareth 3. Reg. 10▪ had a throne of yuory couered all ouer with gold, for the costs and charge wherof he could not expend lesse then thirty thousand talents. The greatnes of these appeareth by their vse, for Polybius reporteth by the relation of Galussa a Noble-man and a great traueller in Affrica, that with them they made posts for houses, ▪ Cenalis. and racks to lay their cattels meat vpon, and likewise folds to enclose them. Apel∣les made an inke of Iuory which was called Elephantes inke, and he painted therewith. It hath bin affirmed by Aelianus & some writers following Pliny, that these teeth are Horns, and that Elephants are hornd beasts, which errour rose vpon the occasion of these words of Pliny; Plin us. Wh ther Ele¦phants haue hornes. Elephantos & arietes candore tantum cornibus assinulatis, in Santonum littore re∣ciprocaos destituit Oceanus : where Aelianus finding a resemblance betwixt Rams and Ele∣phants in their white hornes, was contented to apply that name to them both, which ap∣pertaineth onely to one; for Pliny himselfe Lib. 18. sheweth his meaning by another like speech, of the whetting their hornes vpon trees, and Rhinocerotes vpon stones: for except he had named hornes in the first place it might haue beene questioned whether Rhinoce∣rotes had any hornes, but rather teeth in the second place. But whatsoeuer were the wordes or opinion of Pliny, it is most certaine, that after He∣rodotus and other auncient writers, it is safer to call these teeth, then hornes; and I will breefely set downe the reasons of Philostratus, that will haue them to be teeth, and after∣ward of Grapaldus, Aelianus, and Pausanias, that would make them horns, and so leaue the reader to consider whether opinion he thinketh most agreeable to truth. First, that they are not hornes, it is alledged that hornes fall off and grow euery yeare againe, especially of Harts, and grow forth of their heads, but teeth which are called Fannae or Gang-teeth, standing out of the mouth, fal off together, & are giuen for weapon and defence to beasts, and such are an Elephants: Againe, a horne hath a certaine line or circle neere the roote, which is couered euery yeare, but this commeth vp like a stony substance, without all cir∣cle or couer, and therfore it cannot be a horn. Moreouer, those creatures are said to haue hornes, that haue clouen hooues, this hath no clouen hoofe, but onely fiue distinct fin∣gers vpon a foot. Lastly, all horned beasts haue an empty hollownes in their hornes, (ex∣cept Harts) but this is sound and full thoroughout, except a little passage in the middle like a hole into a tooth: and thus say they which will haue them called teeth. Now on the contrary, those which will haue them Hornes, make these argumentes. First, as the Elks haue their hornes grow out of their eye-lids, the Rhinocerotes or Ethyo∣pian Buls out of their nose, so as it is not vnnaturall for the Elephant to haue his hornes grow out of his mouth. Againe, hornes fall off and come againe in old beasts, but teeth do not so, and therefore these are hornes and not teeth: the power of fire cannot alter teeth, but these teeth breake if you go about to change their proportion or figure, but hornes of Oxen and Elephants may be stretched, bended, altered, straightned, and applied to what fashion so euer you will. Againe, teeth grow out of the gummes and cheeke-bone, as it is apparant, but hornes growe out of the scull and Temples, and so do the Elephants as by obseruation euery man may discern. Lastly as nature hath giuen another shape and grea∣ter proportion of body to Elephants then to any other beasts, so also it is not vnreasona∣ble that it vary in the placing of his horns, for they grow downeward, and the very mole and quantity of his body is sufficient to arme him against the feare of death. Thus they ar∣gument for the horns of Elephants. The Poets haue a prety resemblance of dreames, comparing true dreames to hornes and false dreames to Iuory, because falshoode is euer more burnished, then naked and ragged trueth. And besides the eie of man is translucent, and containeth in it a horny substance, and by the eie we alway receiue the best assurance, but by the mouth (signified by teeth) are many falshoods vented: and for that hornes turne vpwarde to heauen, the fountaine of trueth, but the teeth of an Elephant growe downward towardes the earth the mother of error. And for this cause Aeneas by Virgil and Homer, is said to come in at the horny gate of Somnus, and to go forth at the Iuory: Virgils verses are these: Sunt geminae Somni portae quarum altera fertur, Altera candenti praefecta nitens Elephanto. His vbi dum natum Anchises, vnaque Sibillam; Cornea Qua veris facilis datur exitus vmbris, Sed falsa ad coelum mittunt in somnia manes, Poesequitur dictis, portaque emittit eburna. And here we will leaue, and prosecute no further this discourse of their hornes and teeth, but proceede to the other outward parts of this beast. The toung is very small though broad, his truncke called Proboscis and Promuscis, Aelianus. is a large hollow thing hanging from his nose like skinne to the groundward: Aristotle. and when he fee∣deth it lyeth open, like the skin vpon the bill of a Turkey-cock, to draw in both his meate and drinke, vsing it for a hand, and therefore improperly it is called a hand. For by it he re∣ceiueth of his keeper whatsoeuer he giueth him, with it he ouerthroweth trees, and where soeuer he swimmeth, through it he draweth breath. It is crooked, gristly, and inflexible at the roote nexte to the nose: within, it hath two passages, one into the heade and bodie by which he breatheth, and the other into his mouth, whereby he receiueth his meate: Gillius and herein is the woorke of God most woonderfull, not onely in giuing vnto it such a diuerse proportion and anatomie, but also giuing him reason to knowe this benifite of it, that so long as he is in the water and holdeth vp that trunck, he can not perish. With this hee fighteth in warre, and is able to take vp a small piece of money from the earth: with it he hath beene seene to pull downe the toppe of a tree, Vartomannus which twenty foure men with a rope could not make to bend. With it he driueth away his hunters when he is chased, for he can drawe vp therein a great quantity of water, and shoote it forth againe, to the amazement and the ouerthrow of them that persecute him. The Moores say that he hath twoe heartes, one where withall he is incensed, and another whereby hee is pacifi∣ed. But the trueth is, as Aristotle in the dissection of the hearte obserued, there is a double ventrickle, and bone in the heart of an Elephant. He hath a Liuer without any apparant gall, but that side of the liuer being cut, whereon the gall shoulde lye, a certaine humour commeth foorth like a gall. Wherefore Aelianus sayth, he hath his gall in his maw-gutte, which is so full of sinewes, that one would thinke he had foure bellies; in this receiueth he his meate, hauing no other receptacle for it: his intralles are like vnto a Swines, but much greater. His Liuer foure times so greate as an Oxes, and so all the residue excepte the Melte: he hath two pappes a little beside his breast vnder his shoulders, and not betweene his hin∣der legges or loynes, they are very small and cannot be seene on the side. Aristotle. The reasons hereof are giuen, first that he hath but two pappes, because he bringeth forth but one at a time, and they stand vnder his shoulders like an Apes, because hee hath no hoofes but distinct feet like a mannes, and also bicause from the breaste floweth more aboundance of milke. The genitall parte is like a Horses, but lesser then the proportion of his bodie affoor∣deth: the stones are not outwardly seene, because they cleaue to his raines. But the Fe∣male hath her genitall betwixte her thighes: the forlegges are much longer then the hin∣der legges, and the feet be greater. His legges are of equall quantity, both aboue and be∣neathe the knees, and it hath anckle bones verie lowe. The articles doe not ascende so high as in other creatures, but kept low neere the earth. He bendeth his hinder legs like a mans when he sitteth, but by reason of his great waight hee is not able to bend on both sides together, Gill s but either leaneth to the right hand or to the left and so sleepeth: It is false that they haue no ioynts or articles in their legs, for when they please they can vse, bend, and moue them, but after they grow old, they vse not to lie downe or straine them by rea∣son of their great weight, but take their rest leaning to a tree: and if they did not bend their legs, they could neuer go any ordinary and stayed pace. Their feet are round like a hors∣ses, but so as they reach from the middle euery way two spans length, and are as broad as a bushell, hauing fiue distinct toes vpon each foot, the which toes are very little clouen, to the intent that the foot may be stronger; and yet parted, that when he treadeth vppon soft grounde, the weyght of his body presse not downe the legge to deepe. Hee hath no nailes vpon his toes, his taile is like an Oxes taile, hauing a little haire at the end, and the residue thereof peeled and without haire: He hath not any bristly hairs to couer his back: and thus much for their seuerall parts and their vses. their inward natural parts There is not any creature so capable of vnderstanding as an Elephant, and therefore it is requisite to tarry somewhat the longer in expressing the seuerall properties, and natu∣rall qualities thereof, which sundry and variable inclinations, cannot choose but bring great delight to the reader. They haue a wonderfull loue to their owne Countrey, so as although they be neuer so well delighted with diuers meats and ioyes in other places, yet in memory thereof they send forth teares, Aelianus Tzetzes. The Places of their abod and they loue also the waters, riuers, and ma∣rishes, so as they are not vnfitly called Riparij such as liue by the riuers sides: although they cannot swim by reason of their great and heauy bodies, vntill they be taught. Also they neuer liue solitary but in great flocks, except they be sicke or watch their yong ones, and for either of these they remaine aduenturous vnto death, Pliny. the eldest leadeth the herd, and the second driueth them forward, if they meet any man they giue him way, and goe out of his sight. Leo Afer: Their voice is called by the word Barrire, that is to bray, and thereupon the Elephants themselus are called Barri ; Festus Philomelae avthor. for his voice commeth out of his mouth and nostrils togither, like as when a man speaketh breathing; wherefore Aristotle calleth it rawcity, or hoarsnes, like the low sound of a Trumpet, this sound is verie terrible in battailes as shall be after∣ward declared. They liue vpon the fruits of plants and rootes, and with their truncks and heads, ouer∣throw the tops of trees, The meat of wilde Eleph. Pliny. Solinus and eat the boughes and bodies of them, and many times vpon the leaues of trees he deuoureth Chamaeleons, whereby he is poisoned and dieth if hee eat not immediately a wilde Oliue. They eat earth often without harme, but if they eat it sildome, it is hurtfull and procureth paine in their b l ies; so also they eat stones. They are so louing to their fellowes, that they will not eat their meat alone, but hauing found a prey, they go and inuite the residue to their feastes and cheere, more like to reasonable ciuill men, Aelianus. Hermolaus. then vnreasonable brute beasts. There are certaine noble melons in Aethiopia, which the Elephants being sharpe-smelling-beastes do winde a great way off, and by the conduct of their noses come to those Gardens of Melons, and there eat and deuour them: When they are tamed they will eate Barlie either whole or grounde: of whole at one time is giuen them nine Macedonian Bushels, but of meale six, and of drinke eyther wine or water thirty Macedonian pintes at a time, that is fourteen gallons, but this is obserued, that they drinke not wine except in warre, when they are to fight, but water at all times, whereof they will not tast, except it be muddy and not cleare, for they auoid cleare wa∣ter, Aelianus Simocratus A secret. Pliny. loathing to see their owne shaddow therein; and therefore when the Indians are to passe the water with their Elephants, they choose darke and cloudy nightes wherein the moone affordeth no light. If they perceiue but a mouse run ouer their meat, they will not eat thereof, for there is in them a great hatred of this creature. Also they wil eat dryed Figges, Grapes, Onions, Bulrushes, Palmes, and Iuy leaues: There is a Region in India; called Phalacrus, A secret in a countrey of India. which signifieth Balde, because of an herbe growing therein, which cau∣seth euery liuing thing that eateth therof, to loose both horn and haire, and therefore no man can be more industrious or warie to auoide those places, then is an Elephant, and to beare euery greene thing growing in that place when he passeth thorough it. Aelianus It will forbeare drinke eight daies together, and drinke wine to drunkennesse like an Ape. It is delighted aboue measure with sweet sauours, oyntments, and smelling flowers, for which cause their keepes will in the Summer time lead them into the medowes of flo∣wers, where they of themselues will by the quicknes of their smelling, Their loue to sweet flowers. Aelianus. chuse out and ga∣ther the sweetest flowers, and put them into a basket if their keeper haue any; which being filled, like daintie and neat men, they also desire to wash, and so will go and seeke out wa∣ter to wash themselues, and of their owne accord returne backe againe to the basket of flo∣wers, which if they find not, they will bray and call for them. Afterward being led into their stable, they will not eat meat vntill they take of their flowers and dresse the brimmes of their maungers therewith, and likewise strew their roome or standing place, pleasing themselues with their meat, because of the sauor of the Flowers stucke about their cratch, like dainty fed persons which set their dishes with greene hearbs, and put them into their cups of wine. Their pace is very slow, for a child may ouertake them by reason of their high and larg bodies (except in their feare) and for that cause they cannot swim: as also, Gillius. The shiping of Elephants by reason that the toes of their feet are very short and finally diuided. When they are brought into a ship, they haue a bridge made of wood, and couered with earth, and greene boughes are set on either side, so that they immagine they go vpon the land vntill they enter into the ship; because the boughes keepe them from sight of the Sea. They are most chast, Aelianus. and keepe true vnto their males without all inconstant loue or seperation, admitting no adul∣teries amongest them, and like men which tast of Venus not for any corporall lust, but for desire of heires and successors in their families, so do Elephants, without all vnchast and vnlawfull lust, take their veneriall complements, for the continuation of their kind, and neuer aboue thrice in all their daies, either male or female suffer carnall copulation (but the female onely twice.) Yet is their rage great when the female prouoketh them, and al∣though they fight not among themselues for their females, (except very sildome) yet do they so burne in this fury, that many times they ouerthrow trees and houses in India by their tuskes, and running their head like a Ram against them, wherefore then they keepe them low & down by subtraction of their meat, & also bring some stranger to beat them. There was a certaine cunning hunter sent into Mauritania by the Roman Emp▪ to hunt and take Elephants; on a day he saw a goodly young Elephant in copulation with another, & instantly a third aproched with a direfull braying, as if he would haue eaten vp al the com∣pany, and as it afterward appeared, he was an arriuall to the female, Aelianus. which we saw in co∣pulation with the other male: when he approched neere, both of them set themselues to combat, which they performd like some vnresistable waues of the Sea, or as the hils which are shaken together by an earthquake, wherein each one charged the other most furiously for their loue, to the terror and admiration of all the beholders, and so at last becam both disarmed of their teeth and hornes by their often blowes, before one had ouercome the o∣ther, and so at last by the hunters were parted asunder, being euer afterward quiet from such contentions about their females for copulation. The Indians separate the stables of the females far asunder from the males, because at that time they ouerthrowe their houses. They are modest and shamefast in this action, The place & manner of their copula∣tion Plinyus. for they seeke the Desarts, woodes, and secret places for procreation, and somtimes the waters, because the waters doe support the Male in that action, whereby hee ascendeth and descendeth from the backe of the female with more ease: and once it was seene, that in Virgea (a Countrey of the Corascens ) two Elephants did engender out of India, other∣wise they couple not out of their owne countreys: When they goe to copulation, they turne their heads towards the east, but whether in remembrance of Paradise, or for the Mandragoras, or for any other cause, I cannot tell: the female sitteth while she is couerd. Albertus. They begin to ingender, the male at sixe, ten, twelue, fifteene or twenty yeare olde, the female not before ten yeares old: They couple but fiue daies in two yeares, and neuer af∣ter the female is filled till she haue beene cleare one whole yeare, Solinus. The time of copulation Arrianus and after the second co∣pulation, he neuer more toucheth his female. At that time the male breatheth foorth at his nose a certaine fat humor like a menstruous thing, but the female hath them not til hir place of conception be opened: and alway the day after her filling, she washeth her selfe before she returne to the flocke. Aristotle. The time of their go og with young The time of their going with yong is according to some two years, and according to o∣ther three, the occasion of this diuersity is, because their time of copulation cannot cer∣tainely be knowne, because of their secrecy, for the greater bodies that beasts haue, they are the lesse fruitfull. She is deliuered in great paine, leaning vpon her hinder Legges. They neuer bring forth but one at a time, and that is not much greater then a great cow∣calfe (of three monthes old,) which she nourisheth sixe or eight yeare. As soone as it is Calued, Diodonus Pogius. Aelianus. it seeth and goeth, and sucketh with the mouth, not with the trunke, and so grow∣eth to a great stature. The females when they haue calued are most fierce, for feare of their young ones, but if a man come and touch them, they are not angry, for it seemeth they vnderstand that he toucheth them not for any desire to take or harme them, but rather to stroke and ad∣mire them. The loue of the male to the female & of both to the Calfe. Sometimes they goe into the Water to the belly and there calue for feare of the Dragon: the male neuer forsaketh her, but keepeth with her for the like feare of the Dragon, and feede and defend their young ones with singular loue and constancye vnto death: as appeareth by the example of one, that heard the braying of her calfe fallen into a ditch and not able to arise, the female ranne vnto it, and for hast fell downe vppon it, so crushing it to death, Tzetzes. and breaking her owne Necke with one and the same violente loue. As they liue in heards, so when they are to passe ouer a ryuer or Water, they send ouer the least or youngest first, because their great bodies together should not cause the deepe water to swell or rise aboue their heigth: the other stand on the bancke and obserue howe deepe he wadeth, and so make account that the greater may with more assurance follow after the younger and smaller, Plutarch Aelianus Philostratus. then they the elder and taller; and the females carry ouer their Calues vpon their snowts & long eminent teeth binding them fast with their trunks, (like as with ropes or male girts that they may not fall) being sometime holpen by the male; wherein appeareth an admirable point of naturall wisedome, both in the carriage of their young and in sending of the lesser foremost, not onely for the reason aforesaid, but also because they being hunted and prosecuted, it is requisite that the greatest and strong∣est come in the reare and hindmost part, for the safeguarde of the weaker, against the fury of their persecutors, being better able to fight then the formost, whom in natural loue and pollicy, they set farthest from the danger. Mutius which had beene thrice Consull affirmeth, that he saw Elephants brought on shore at Puteoli in Italy : they were caused to goe out of the ship backeward, all along the bridge that was made for them, Tha bring∣ing of Ele∣phants out of ships. A secret, if true. that so the sight of the Sea might terrifie them, and cause them more willingly to come on land, and that they might not be terrified with the length of the bridge from the continent. Pliny and Solinus affirme, that they will not goe on ship∣boord, vntill their keeper by some intelligible signe of oath, make promise vnto them of their returne backe againe. They sometime as hath beene said fight one against another, and when the weaker is ouercome, Aristotle. Of their figh¦ting he is so much abased and cast downe in minde, that euer after he feareth the voyce of the conqueror. They are neuer so fierce, violent, or wilde, but the sight of a Ramme tameth and dis∣mayeth them, for they feare his hornes; for which cause the Egiptians picture an Ele∣phant and a Ramme, to signifie a foolish king that runneth away for a fearefull sight in the field. Gillius Aelianus Coelius Zoroastres. Their fear of Rams, swine, and other beasts Ʋolateranus And not onely a Ramme, but also the gruntling clamour or cry of Hogs: by which meanes the Romanes ouerthrew the Carthaginians, and Pirrhus which trusted ouermuch to their Elephants. When Antipater besieged the Megarians very straitly with many Ele∣phants, the Citizens tooke certaine Swine and anointed them with pitch, then set them on fire and turned them out among the Elephants, who crying horribly by reason of the fire on their bodies, so distemperd the Elephants, that all the wit of the Macedonians could not restraine them from madnesse, fury, and flying vpon their owne company, onely be∣cause of the cry of the Swine. And to take away that feare from Elephants, they bring vp with them when they are tamed, young Pigges and Swine euer since that time. When E∣lephants are chased in hunting, if the Lions see them, they runne from them like Hinde∣calfes from the Dogges of Hunters, and yet Iphicrates sayeth, that among the Hesperian or westerne Aethiopians, Lions set vpon the young Calues of Elephants and wound them: but at the sight of the mothers, which come with speede to them, when they heare them cry, the Lions runne away, and when the mothers finde their young ones imbrued in their owne bloud, they themselues are so inraged that they kill them, and so retire from them, The cruelty of the female to their woū¦ded Calues. Solin s. Stat. Seb si. after which time the Lions returne and eate their flesh. They will not indure the sauour of a Mouse, but refuse the meat which they haue run ouer: in the riuer Ganges of India, there are blew Wormes of sixty cubits long hauing two armes; these when the Elephants come to drinke in that riuer, take their trunks in their handes and pull them off. There are Dra∣gons among the Aethiopians, which are thirty yards or paces long, these haue no name a∣mong the inhabitants but Elephant-killers. And among the Indians also there is an in∣bred and natiue hatefull hostility betwixte Dragons and Elephants: Aelianus for which cause the Dragons being not ignorant that the Elephants feed vpon the fruites and leaues of green trees, doe secretly conuay them selues into them or to the toppes of rockes: couering their hinder part with leaues, and letting his head and fore part hang downe like a rope on a suddaine when the Elephant commeth to crop the top of the tree, she leapeth into his face, and diggeth out his eies, and because that reuenge of malice is to little to satisfie a Serpent, she twineth her gable-like-body about the throat of the amazed Elephant, and so strangleth him to death. Againe they marke the footsteps of the Elephant when he goeth to feed, and so with their tailes, net in and intangle his legs and feet: when the Elephant perceiueth and fee∣leth them, he putteth downe his trunke to remoue and vnty their knots and ginnes; then one of them thrusteth his poisoned▪ stinging-head into his Nostrils, and so stop vp his breath, the other▪ prick and gore his tender-belly-parts. Some againe meet him and flye vpon his eies and pull them foorth, so that at the last he must yeeld to their rage, and fall downe vpon them, killing them in his death by his fall, whom he could not resist or ouer∣come being aliue: and this must be vnderstood, that forsomuch as Elephants go togither by flockes and heards, the subtill Dragons let the foremost passe, and set vpon the hind∣most, that so they may not be oppressed with multitude. Also it is reported that the blood of an Elephant is the coldest blood in the world, and that Dragons in the scorching heate of Summer, cannot get any thing to coole them, ex∣cept this blood; for which cause they hide themselus in riuers and brooks whether the Ele¦phants come to drinke, and when he putteth downe his trunke they take hold thereof, and instantly in great numbers leape vp vnto his eare, which is naked, bare, and without de∣fence: where out they sucke the blood of the Elephant vntill he fall downe dead, and so they perish both together. Of this blood commeth that ancient Cinnabaris, Of Cinnaba¦ris or the best red colour made by commixture of the blood of Elephants and Draggons both together, which alone is able and nothing but it, to make the best representation of blood in painting. Some haue corrupted it with Goats-blood, and call it Milton, and Mimum, and Monochroma : it hath a most rare and singuler vertue a∣gainst all poysons, beside the vnmatcheable property aforesaid. These Serpents or Dragons are bred in Taprobona, in whose heads are many pretious stones, with such naturall seales or figuratiue impressions, as if they were framed by the hande of man, for Podisippus and Tzetzes affirme, that they haue seen one of them taken out of a Dragons head, hauing vpon it the liuely and artificial stampe of a Chariot. The fight of Elephants. Pliny. Elephants are enimies to wilde Bulles, and the Rhinocerots, for in the games of Pompey, when an Elephant and a Rhinoceros were brought together, the Rhinoceros ranne instantly and whet his horne vppon a stone, and so prepared himselfe to fight, striking most of all at the belly of the Elephant, because he knewe that it was the tenderest and most penetrable part of the body. The Rhinoceros was as long as the Elephant, but the legges thereof were much shorter, and as the Rhinocerotes sharpen their hornes vppon the stones, so doe the Elephants their teeth vpon trees: the sharpnesse of either yeeldeth not to any steele. Aelianus Oppianus Strabo. Especiall the Rhino∣cerot teareth and pricketh the legs of the Elephant: They fight in the woods for no other cause, but for the meat they liue vpon, but if the Rhinocerot get not the aduantage of the Elephants belly, but set vpon him in some other part of his body, hee is soone put to the worst, by the sharpenes of the yuory tooth which pierceth through his more then buffe∣hard-skinne (not to be pierced with any dart) with great facility, being set on with the strength of so able an aduersary. The Tygre also feareth not an Elephant, but is fiercer and stronger, Eustathius for he leapeth vpon his head and teareth out his throat, but the Gryphins which ouercome almost all beasts, are not able to stand with the Lyons or Elephants. The females are far more strong, chearefull, and couragious then the males, and also they are apt to beare the greater burthens; but in War he male is more gracefull and ac∣ceptable, Ʋartomanus The conditi¦ons & corage of male and female. Gillius because he is taller, giuing more assured ensignes of victory and fortitude: for their strength is admirable, as may be coniecturd by that which is formerly recited of their trunke, and Vartoman affirmeth, that he saw three Elephants with their onely heades, driue a great ship out of the Sea-water where it was fastened vnto the shore. When he is most loaded he goeth surest, for he can carry a woodden Tower on his backe with thirty men therein, and their sufficient foode and warlike instruments. The king of India was woont to go to warre with 30000. Elephants of war, and beside these he had also followed him 3000. Albertus The strength and burthen of an Eleph. of the chiefest and strongest in India, which at his commaund would ouethrow trees, Houses, Walles, or any such thing standing against him: and indeed vpon these were the Indians wont to fight, for the defence of their coast, and country. The farthest region of that continent is called Partalis, inhabited by the Gan∣garides and Calingae, the king whereof was wont to haue seuen hundred Elephants to watch his Army, and there was no meane prince in all India which was not Lord of many Ele∣phants. Pliny. The keepers and maintai∣ners of Elep. Solinus The king of Palibotrae kept in stipend, eight thousand euery day, and beyond his territory was the king of Modubae and Molindae, which had foure hundred Elephants. These fight with men, and ouerthrowe all that come within their reach, both with trunkes and teeth. There were certaine officers and guiders of these Elephants, which were called Elephan∣tarchae, whoe were the gouernors of sixteene Elephants, and they which did institute and teach them Martiall discipline, were called Elephanta gogi. The military Elephant did cary 4. Pollux. The instruc∣tion of Ele∣phants for war Aelianus persons on his bare backe, one fighting on the right hand, another fighting on the left hand, a third which stood fighting backward from the Elephants head, and a fourth in the middle of these holding the raines and guiding the beast to the descretion of the Soul∣diers, euen as the pilot in a ship guideth the sterne, wherein was required an equall know∣ledge and dexterity, for they vnderstand any language quickly, for when the Indian which ruled them said, strike heere on the right hand, or els on the left, or refraine and stand stil, no reasonable man could yeald readier obedience. They did fasten by iron chaines, first of all vpon the elephant that was to beare ten, fifteene, twenty, or thirty men, on either side, two panniers of iron bound vnderneath their belly, and vpon them the like panniers of wood hollow, wherin they place their men at armes, and couered them ouer with small boards, for the trunk of the elephant was couered with a maile for defence, and vpon that a broad sword, and two cubits long: this (as also the wodden Castle or paniers aforsaid) were fastened first to the necke, and then to the rumpe of the elephant. Being thus armed, they entred the battell, and they shewed vnto the beast to make them more fierce, wine, red liquor made of rice, and white cloth, for at the sight of any of these, his courage and rage increaseth aboue all measure; then at the sound of the Trumpet he beginneth with teeth to strike, teare, beate, spoyle, take vp into the aire, cast down again, stamp vpon men vnder feet, ouerthrow with his trunke, and make way for his riders to pierce with Speare, shield, and sword; so that his horrible voice, his wonderfull body, his terrible force, his admirable skill, his ready and inclinable obedience, and his straunge and sildome seene shape, produced in a maine battell no meane accidents and ouerturnes. For this cause we read how that Pyrrhus first of all, produced elephants against the Romans in Lucania: af∣terward Asdruball in Affrica, Antiochus in the East, and Iugurtha in Numidia. Against these new kindes of Castle-fighting and Souldier-bearing-beastes, on the contrary they inuented New kindes of stratagems, as is before sette downe, and also new instrumentes of Warre, The fight a∣gainst eleph. for a Centuryon in Lucania with a new deuised sharp sword, cutte of the trunke of this Beast: againe other inuented, that two armed Horsses should draw a charriot, and in the same armed men with Iauelins and sharpe speares, the speedy horses should withall force run vpon the Elephants, and the speare-men directing their course and Weapons some vpon the beast, other vpon the riders, did not onely wound the beast, but also by celerity of the horses, escape all danger. Other againe sent against him armed Souldiers, hauing their Armour made full of sharpe prickes or piercing piked Nayles, so that when the beast did strike at them with his trunke, he receiued grieuous woundes by his owne blowes. Againe there were certaine young men Souldiers, armed with light armour, which being mounted vppon swift Horsses, could cast Darts with singular facility, and without the reach of the beast, many times wounding him with long speares, and so by example of the Horse-men, the foote-men, grew more bold, and with piles in the earth annoyed the belly of the Beast, and vtterly vanquishing it and the rider. Againe, they deuised slings to cast stones, wher∣by they beate off the riders, and many times ouerthrewe the Castle bearer, as it were by some violent stroke of a Cannot shot; neither was there euer any more easie way to dis∣aster these monster-seeming-Soldiers, then by casting of stones, and lastly they would suf∣fer their Elephants and their riders by poore hopes and appearances of feare, to enter into the middest among them, and so begirte and inclose them, that they tooke the Ele∣phants aliue; and also more shooters of Darts carried in Chariots with the stronge course of Horsses, did so annoy them, that whereas their bodies were great and vnweldy, not nimble to stir out of place, it became more easie to kill an elephant then a Horsse because many shooters at one time could pierce so faire a marke with vnresistable weapons. And these things are related by Vegetius. At the last the fight with Elephants turned into a publike game or pastime, Games of Elephants. both to see them fought withall by men, and also among themselues. When certaine prisoners of the Romans were taken by Anniball, he first constrained them to skirmish among them∣selues, and so slew one another except onely one; and he was by the like commaunde∣ment forced to fight with an Elephant, but vpon condition of liberty if he escaped aliue: and thereupon ioyned Combat, and slew the Elephant, to the great griefe and amaze∣ment of all the Carthaginians ; but going home, according to agreement, Anniball fea∣ring that by this fact those great beasts would grow into contempt, sent certaine Horse∣men to kill him by the way. Their trunke or hand is most easie to be cut off; for so it happened in the aedility or tem∣ple office of Claudius, Antonius and Posthumus being consuls, and afterward in the Circus, Fenestella. when the Luculli were the commons officers. And when Pompey was consull the second time, there were 17. or 20. which at one time fought within the Circus, at the dedication of the Temple of Venus the Victoria, where the Getulians fought with them with Speares and Dartes; for their happened an admirable accident, one of the Souldiers who hauing a hurt in his feete did creepe vppon his knees betwixt the Legges of the Elephants, and cast vp the Darts ouer his head into the beastes belly, which fell downe round about him, to the great pleasure of the beholders, so that many of the elephants perished rather by Art then the strength of the Souldier. No lesse was the Miracle of another slaine with one stroke, for a pile ran into his temples through his eie, and there stacke so fast, that it could not be pulled forth againe; which thing was afterward assayed by Iulius Caesar, and in the third time of his consulship, there were twenty Elephantes, which in the Games fought with fiue hundred men, and so many with Towers on their backes, bearing threescore men in euery Tower. To conclude, elephants are afraid of fire, and Martiall made this Epigram of a Bul slaine by an elephant, which was wont to domineer in all their triumphant games, wherewith∣all I will conclude this discourse. Qui modo per to tam flammis stimulatus arenam Sustulerat raptas Taurus in astra pilas Occubuit tandem cornuto ardore petitus Dum facilem tolli sic elephanta putat. In the next place it is good to relate the story of the taking and taming of elephants, The taking of Elephants Pliny. Strabo. for in Libia about the Trogloditae, the hunting and taking of elephants haue giuen many names to seuerall Townes, as Elephantina, and Elephantis, Epitherae, Philothera, and the hunting of Elephants by Ptolemais, by the port Saba, the Citty Daraba, and L cha. In Af∣fricke they take them in great ditches, wherinto when they are fallen, the people present∣ly with boughes, mattocks, leauers, and digging downe of high raised places, take them out againe, and so turne them into a valley wrought by the labour of man, most firmely walled on both sides, where with famine they tame him: for when he would gently take a bough at the hand of a man, they adiudged him tamed, and grew familiar with him, lea∣ding him away without all scruple. But the Indians vse another more ingenious and speedy meanes to tame them, which is this; Pliny. first, they dig also a great ditch, and place such meate therein as the beast loueth, who winding it and comming thereunto, for desire thereof falleth into the fosse or ditch: being so fallen in and not able to come forth againe, one commeth to him with Whips, beating him very griuously for a good space, to the great griefe of the beast, who through his inclosing can neither runne away nor helpe himsefe; then commeth another during this time of punishment and blameth the first man for beating the beast, who departeth presently as one afraid of his rebuke, the other pittieth the beast, and stroaketh him, and so goeth away: then commeth the Whipper againe, and scourgeth the Elephant as be∣fore and that more grieuously to his greater torment for a good space together: where∣vpon the time fulfilled, the other commeth againe and fighteth with the Whipper, and forcibly seemeth to driue him away, Albertus. and relieue the poore beast; and this they doe suc∣cessiuely three or four times; so at the last, the Elephant groweth to know and loue his de∣liuerer; who by that meanes draweth him out and leadeth him away quietly: While this thing is doing, the smiter and Whipper vseth a strange and vnwonted kind of habit, so as he may neuer be knowne by the Elephant after he is tamed, for feare of reuenge: of which you shall heare more afterward, in the farther discourse and opening the nature of this beast. Arrianus and Strabo relate another way whereby the Indians take their Elephantes, which because they Write vpon their owne eye-sight, of the things they knewe assuredly, I haue thought good to expresse the deuise. Foure or fiue Hunters, first of all chuse out some plaine place, without Trees or Hilles but declining, by the space of some foure or fiue furlongs; this they dig like a wide Ditch as aforesaid, and with the earth they take vp, they raise Walls about it like a trench, and in the sides of the trench they make cer∣taine dennes with holes, to conuay in light to the Watch-men, whom they place there∣in, to giue notice and obserue when the Elephants are inclosed; then make they a narow bridge couered with earth at the farther end of the trench, that the beastes may dread no fallacy: and for the more speedy effecting & compassing their desire, they also include in the trench three or foure tame female Elephants, to entise and draw into them the wild ones. Now these beastes in the day time feede not so boldly as in the night, and therefore they cannot easily be deceiued or taken in the light; but in the night great flockes of them follow the Captaine, (as we haue already shewed,) and so comming neere this trench, partly by the voice, and partlye by the sauour and smell of the females, they are drawen into the trench; then the Watch-men with all speede, pull downe the bridge, and other of them goe into the next Townes to call for helpe, who vppon the first notice thereof, come to the place mounted vppon the best and strongest tame Elephantes, and so com∣passe them about, giuing meate in their presence to the tame, but besiedging the inclosed, they keepe them from all meate and foode, vntill they be so weakened that they dare en∣ter in among them, but in this manner; they turne in their tame Elephantes and goe vnder their bellyes, and so when they come neere the Wilde Elephantes, they speedily conuaye themselues vnder his bellye, and lay vnauoydable fetters vppon their feete: then prouoke they the tame ones to beate and fight with the Wilde, who by reason of the manacles vpon their feete, are easily ouerthrowen and fall to the ground; being on the ground, they put halters vpon their neckes made of raw Oxe hides, and so bind them to the tame and domesticall Elephantes; And while they lye on the grounde, they get vppon them, and to the intent that theyr Ryders may be without daunger of harme by them, they cut the skinne of their neckes round about in a circle, with a sharpe sword, and vppon the wounde they tye and fasten a rope, that so the payne may constraine the Beast to be quiet, so that by this they beginne to feele their owne weakenesse, and leaue off their wildenesse, betaking themselues to the mercy of their new Maisters. Being thus raised from the earth againe, and yoaked by the neckes and Legges to the tamed Elephants, they are safely led home into stables, where they are fastened to great pillers by their neckes, and if they refuse to eate their meate, with Tymbrels, Cimbals, Harpes, and other musicall instruments, they are so entised from sullen Wildenesse, that they forget their first natures, and yeald al louing obedience to men, as to their victorious conquerors and vnresistable maisters. These beastes by their sagacity and naturall instinct, do sometime foresee their owne perill, and discouer the traines and secret intentions of the hunters, Aelianus so as they cannot bee drawen into the ditches and fosses by any allurements: but presaging their owne misfor∣tunes, turne backe againe vpon their hunters, euen through the middest of them, and so seeke to saue themselues by flight, ouerthrowing their enimies that dare approch vnto them At which time there is a fierce fight, to the great slaughter many times both of men and beastes; for the men to stay his flight, bend their speares, and charge their darts and arrowes, to strike the Elephant directly on the face, and if the beast perceiue that he hath ouerthrowne any man, instantly hee maketh to him, taketh him in his teeth, lifting him vp into the aire, and casting him downe againe, and stampeth vpon him, wounding him many times with his teeth or hornes, wherby the putteth him to cruell torments, and leaueth him not till he be dead. And when they inuade or set vpon a man, they spread forth their broad eares, (which are fashioned like the Winges of Ostriches) as the sailes of a ship, and drawing vp their trunk vnder their teeth, their noses stand forth like the beake of some ship, & so rush they with vnresistable violence vpon the weake bodies of men, ouerturning them in no other sort, then a mighty great hulke or man of Warre, the little Oares or Whirries in the Sea. And as the Trumpets in Warre giue the signes of fighting, so do these send forth such terrible yelling and roaring clamors, as bringeth no meane astonishment to his persecu∣tours: beside the lamentable and mournefull voyces of men, by them wounded and fal∣len to the earth; some hauing their knees and bones broken, other their eies trode out of their head, other their Noses pressed flat to their faces, and their whole visages so disfi∣gured and disfauoured in a moment, that their neerest friends, kindred, and acquaintance cannot knowe them. These also fill the spatious aire with direfull cryes, that are heard a great way off, into the Townes and citties adioyning, hauing no other meanes to escape out of the way, and from the teeth of the beast, except he strike his tooth into some root, and there it sticke fast vntill the poore ouerthrowen man can creepe aside and saue him∣selfe by flight. In this conflict, sometime the Elephants, and somtimes men are the conquerors, by bringing vpon the beasts diuers terrours and manacles, out of which they are not very ea∣sily deliuered: for menne also haue their trumpets, and so make the Woodes and fieldes ring with them, the ratling of their Armour and shieldes, and their owne howling and Whooping, kindling fires on the earth, casting both fire-braunds and burning Torches into the face of the Elephant, by all which the huge beast is not a little disgraced and ter∣rified. So that being bereft of their wits, they turne back and run into the ditch which they so carefully auoyded before. But if their rage proceede vndeterred, and men be forced to yeald vnto them, forth they go into the woods, making the trees to bend vnto them as a dog or an Oxe doth the stand∣ing corne at haruest: breaking off their tops and branches, which hinder their course and flight, as another beast would crop off the eares of corne; but where they are taller then the Woods, there they straine euery ioynt and member in them to get ground and ouer∣goe their Hunters; which they may performe and attaine more easily, because of their customary aboad in those places: and when they are escaped out of the sight of their fol∣lowers, and make account that they are freed from farther persecution, then cast they of all feare, and compound their distracted senses into a remembrance of meat, and so ga∣ther their food from Palmes, Trees or bushes; afterward betaking themselues to rest and quietnesse. But if their Hunters come againe into their sight, they also againe take them to their heels, vntill they haue gotten more ground from them, and then they rest againe: and if the sunne declyne, and light of day faile the Hunters, and darkenesse make an end of the chase; then doe they compasse in the beasts way, and set the wood a fire, (for Elephants feare fire as much as Lyons:) So that by all this it appeareth, that the fabulous tales of Gabinius the Roman writer of Elephants, are not to be belieued; when he affirmeth, that Elephants will fight against and resist the violence of fire. The Trogloditae hunt and take Elephants after another manner, for they climbe vp in∣to the trees, and there sit till the flockes of Elephantes passe by, and vppon the last, the Watch-man suddenly leapeth (with great courage) taking hold vpon his taile and so sly∣ding down to his Legges, and with a sharpe Axe which he hath hanging at his backe cut∣teth the Nerues and sinnewes of his Legges with so great celerity, that the beast cannot turne about to relieue it selfe, before shee be wounded and made vnable to reuenge her harme, Pliny. or preuent her taking: and sometimes she falleth downe on the wounded side, and Crusheth the Hunter-watch-man to death, or else with her force in running, dasheth out his braines against a tree. Strabo. Other waies of taking Elephants. The Elephant eaters (called Elephantophagi ) doe obserue the like pollicy, for by stealth and secretly they set vppon the hindmost, or else the wandring solitary Elephant, and cutte his sinnewes, which causeth the beast to fall downe, whom presently they beheade, and afterward they eate the hinder parts of this Beast so cast downe and taken. Other among the aforesaid Troglodytae, vse a more easie, cunning and lesse perillous kind of taking Elephants; for they set on the ground very strong charged bent-bowes, which are kept by manye of their strongest young men, and so when the flockes of Ele∣phants passe by, they shoote their sharp arrowes dipped in the gall of Serpents, and wound some one of them, and follow him by the blood, vntill he be vnable to make resistance. There are three at euery bowe, two which hold it, and one that draweth the string. Other againe, watch the trees whereunto the beast leaneth when he sleepeth, neere some Wa∣ters, and the same they cutte halfe asunder, whereunto when hee declyneth his bodye, the Tree is ouerturned and the Beast also, and beeing vnable to rise againe because of the short Nerues and no flexions in his Legs, there he lyeth, till the Watch-man come and cut off his head. Aristotle describeth another manner of taking Elephants in this sorte; The Hunter (saith he) getteth vp vpon a tamed Elephant, and followeth the Wilde one till hee haue o∣uertaken it, then commaundeth he the tame beast to strike the other, and so continueth chasing and beating him, til he haue wearied him and broken his vntameable nature. Then doth the rider leape vppon the wearied and tyred Elephant, and with a sharpe pointed Sickle doth gouerne him after the tame one, and so in short space he groweth gentle. And some of them when the ryder alighteth from their backes, grow Wilde and fierce againe; for which cause, they binde their forelegges with strong bands, and by this meanes they take both great and small, old and young ones; but as the old ones are more wilde and ob∣stinate, and so difficult to be taken, so the younger keepe so much with the elder, that a like impossibility or difficulty interposeth it selfe from apprehending them. In the Caspian lake, there are certaine fishes (called Oxyrinchi ) out of whom is made such a firme glew, Gillius that it will not be dissolued in ten daies after it hath taken hold, for which cause they vse it in the taking of Elephants. There are in the Island Zeira many Elephants, whom they take on this manner: In the Mountaines they make certaine cloysters in the earth, hauing two great Trees standing at the mouth of the cloysters, and in those trees they hang vp a great par-cullis gate, with∣in that Cloyster they place a tame female Elephant at the time of their vsuall copulati∣on: the wild Elephants doe speedily winde her, and make to her, and so at the last hauing found the way betwixt the two trees, enter into her; sometime twenty and sometime thir∣ty at a time: then are there two men in the said trees, which cut the rope whereby the gate hangeth, so it falleth downe and includeth the Elephants, where they suffer them alone for sixe or seuen daies without meate, whereby they are so infeebled and famished, that they are not able to stand vpon their legs. Then two or three stronge men enter in amonge them, and with great staues and Clubbes, be labour and cudgell them, till by that meanes they grow tame, and gentle; and although an Elephant be a monster-great-beast and very subtill, yet by these and such like meanes do the inhabitants of India and Aethiopia take many of them, with a very small la∣bour, to their great aduantage. Against these slights of men, may be opposed the subtill and cautelous euasions of the beast, auoyding all the foot-steps of men, if they smell them vpon any herbe or leafe, The subtilty of Elephants against their hunters. and for their fight with the Hunters, they obserue this order. First of all, they set them foremost which haue the best teeth, that so they may not be afraid of Combat, and when they are weary, by breaking downe of trees they escape and fly away. But for their Hun∣ting, they know that they are not hunted in India for no other cause, then for their teeth, and therefore to discourage the hunters, they set them which haue the worst teeth be∣fore, and reserue the strongest for the second encounter: for their wisedome or naturall discretion is heerein to be admired, that they will so dispose themselues in all their bat∣tailes when they are in chase, that euer they fight by course, and inclose the youngest from perill, so that lying vnder the belly of their Dammes they can scarce be seene: and when one of them flyeth they all flye away, to their vsuall resting places, stryuing which of them shall goe foremost: And if it at any time they come to a wide and deepe Ditch, which they cannot passe ouer without a bridge, then one of them descendeth, and goeth downe into the Ditch, and standeth transuerse or Crosse the same, by his great bodye filling vppe the empty partes, and the residue passe ouer vpon his backe as vpon a bridge. Afterward when they are all ouer, they tarry and helpe their fellowe out of the Ditch or Trench againe, by this slight or deuise; one of them putteth downe to him his Legge, and the other in the Ditch windeth his trunke about the same, the residue stan∣ders by cast in bundels of Sprigs with their mouthes, which the Elephant warily and speedily putteth vnder his feete, and so raiseth himselfe out of the Trench againe, Aelianus. Tzetzes. Plutarch and de∣parteth with his fellowes. But if they fall in and cannot finde any helpe or meanes to come forth, they laye aside their naturall Wilde disposition, and are contented to take meate and drinke at the handes of men, whose presence before they abhorred; and being deliuered they thinke no more vpon their former condition, but in forgetfulnesse thereof, remaine obedient to their deliuerers. Being thus taken as it hath beene said, it is also expedient to expresse by what Art and meanes they are Cicurated and tamed. First of all therefore when they are taken, The art of ta¦ming elepha▪ Aelianus they are fastened to some Tree or Piller in the earth, so as they can neyther kicke backeward nor Leape forwarde, and there hunger, thirst, and famine, like twoo most stronge and forcible Ryders abate their naturall wildenesse, strength, feare, and hatred of men: Af∣terward when their keepers perceiue by their deiection of minde, that they beginne to be mollified and altered, then they giue vnto them meate out of their hands, vpon whom the beast doth cast a farre more fauorable and cheerefull eie, considering their owne bondage, and so at the last necessity frameth them vnto a contented and tractable course and inclination. But the Indians by great labour and industry take their young Calues at their Wate∣ring places, and so leade them away, intising them by many allurementes of meate to loue and obey them, so as they grow to vnderstand the Indian language, but the elder In∣dian Elephants doe very hardly and sildome grow tame, because of their remembrance of their former liberty, by any bands and oppression; neuerthelesse by instrumentall mu∣sicke, ioyned with some of their coutrey songs and ditties, they abate their fiercenesse and bring downe their high vntractable stomacks, so as without all bands they remaine quiet, peaceable and obedient, taking their meate which is layed before them. Pliny and Solinus prescribe the iuyce of Barly to be giuen to them for their mitificati∣on, whereunto also agreeth Dioscorides (calling that kind of drinke Zythus ) and the reason heereof is, bycause of the tarte sharpnesse in barly water if it stand a little while; and ther∣fore also they prescribe vineger and ashes to rub the beasts mouth, for it hath power in it to pierce stones, Plutarch al sharp things penitrate deepe into his flesh, and alter his nature: the in∣uention whereof is attributed to Democritus. Being thus tamed they grow into ciuill and familiar vses, for Caesar ascended into the Capitall betwixt foure hundred Elephants, carring at either side burning Torches, and Heliogobalus brought foure Waggons drawne with Elephantes in Vaticanum, and men commonly ride vpon them, for Apollonius sawe neere the Ryuer Indus, a Boy of thirteen yeare old ryding alone vpon an Elephant, spurring and pricking him as freely as any man will do a leane Horsse. They are taught to bend one of their hinder legges to take vp their Ryder, who also must receiue helpe from some other present standers by, The taking vp of their ri¦ders. or else it is impossible to mount on the backe of so high a palfrey. They which are not accustomed to ride vppon these beastes, are affected with vomiting and casting, like men when they first of all take the Sea. vac omanus. Gi lius They are ruled without bridle or raines, onely by a long crooked piece of Wood, bending like a Sickle, and nayled with sharpe Nayles, no man can sitte more safely and more softly vppon a Horsse or Mule then they doe which Ryde vppon the Elephants. N chus Strabo. Elephants for the plowe. The Indians with their lesser Elephantes (which they call bastard Elephantes) plow their ground and corne. The common price of Elephantes is at the least fiue hundred Nobles, and some∣times two thousand. The price of Elephants. The Indian Women are most chast and continent, yet for an Ele∣phant they take a great pride to be hired for Whoores, for they imagine that the fame and receiued oppinyon of their beautye, doeth connteruayle and couer the shame∣full losse of their honesty (as Arrianus wryteth in his booke of Indians. ) Since the time that Elephants haue been tamed, their natures & dispositions haue beene the better obserued and discouered; for they willingly obey their keepers, lear∣ning all feates of Armes, Their obedi∣ence and tr c t le gentle∣nesse. to take vp stones and cast them, and to swimme; so that Strabo affirmeth, there was no possession or wealth comparable to a chariot or Waggon of Ele∣phants. Mutianus which was thrice Consull affirmed to Pliny, that he saw an Elephant which learned the Greeke letters, Pliny. Their lear∣ning in leters and was able with his tongue to Write these wordes. Autos e∣goo Tadegrapsa laphura te kelt'anetheca ; that is, I Wrote these thinges and dedicated the Celtican spoyls: but in these actions of Writing, the hand of the teacher must be also present to teach him how to frame the Letters, and then as Aelianus sayeth they will Wryte vppon Tables, and followe the true proportion of the Characters expressed before their face, whereupon they looke as attentiuely as any Grammarian. In India they are taught many sportes, as to Daunce and Leape, which caused Martiall to Wryte thus; Turpes esseda quod trahunt bisontes Et molles dare iussa quod chore as Nigro bellua nil legat magistro Quis spectacula non putet deorum. When the Prizes of Germanicus Caesar were played; there were many Elephantes which acted strange feates or partes, foure of them went vppon Ropes and ouer the Tables of meate, where on they set their feete so warily that they neuer touched any of the ghests, the boardes or standing Cuppes being fully furnished. And also they learned to daunce after Pipes by measure, sometime Dauncing softly, and sometime apace, and then againe leaping vpright, according to the number of the thing sung or played vpon the in∣strument: and they are apt to learne, remember, meditate, and conceiue such things, as a man can hardly performe. Their industrious care to performe the thinges they are taught, appeareth heere∣in, bycause when they are secret and alone by themselues, they will practise leaping, dan∣cing, and other strange feats, which they could not learn suddenly in the presence of their maisters (as Pliny affirmeth) for certaine truth of an Elephant which was dull and hard of vnderstanding, his keeper found him in the night practising those thinges which hee had taught him with many stripes the day before, and cold not preuaile by reason of the beasts slow conceit. Their was an Elephant playing vpon a Cymball, Plutarch. and others of his fellowes dauncing about him, for there was fastened to either of both of his forelegs one Cymball, and an∣other hanged to his trunke, the beast would obserue iust time, and strike vppon one, and then the other, to the admiration of all the beholders. There was a certaine banquet pre∣pared for Elephants vpon a low bed in a palour set with diuers dishes and po s of Wine, whereinto were admitted twelue, sixe males, apparelled like men, and sixe females appa∣relled like women: when they saw it, they sat downe with great modesty, taking heere and there like discreet temperat ghests, neither rauening vppon one dish or other, and when they should drinke, they tooke the cup receiuing in the liquor very manerly, and for sport & festiuity would through their trunks squirt or cast a litle of their drink vpon their atten∣dants; Aelianus so that this beast is not onely of an admirable greatnes but of a more wonderful meakenesse and docibility. Aristotle. The reue∣rence of Ele∣phants to Kings. They are said to diseerne betwixt kings and common persons, for they adore and bend vnto them, poynting to their Crownes, which caused Martiall to Write this Te∣trastichon ; Quid pius & supplex elephas te Caesar adorat Non facit hoc iussus, nulloque docente magistro Hic modo qui tauro tam metuendus erat Crede mihi numen sentit & ille tuum. The King of Indians was watched with foure and twenty Elephants, 3. kindes of Elephants. who were taught to forbeare sleepe, and to come in their turnes at certaine houres, and so were they most faithfull, carefull and inuincible. And as there be of them three kindes, the Palustrians or Marishye Elephantes are hare-brained and inconstant, the Elephantes of the Moun∣taines are subtill and euill natured, lying in waite to destroy and deuoure, but the Cam∣pestriall Elephants are meeke, Gentle, Docible, and apt to imitate men. In these is the vnderstanding of their country language, of obedience to Princes, gouernment, and of∣fices; the loue and pleasure of glory and praise: and also that which is not alway in men; namely, equity, wisedome, and probity. They haue also a kinde of Religion, for they worshippe, reuerence, and obserue the course of the Sunne, Moone, and Starres; for when the Moone shineth, The religion of elephants. they goe to the Waters wherein she is apparant, and when the Sunne ariseth, they salute and reue∣rence her face: and it is obserued in Aethiopia, that when the Moone is chaunged vntill her prime and appearance, these Beastes by a secret motion of nature, Pliny. Solinus. take boughes from of the trees they feede vpon, and first of all lift them vp to heauen, and then looke vppon the Moone, which they doe many times together; as it were in supplication to her. In like manner they reuerence the Sunne rysing, holding vp their trunke or hand to heauen, Aelianus. in congratulation of her rising. Iuba was woont to say, that this beast was acceptable to those Gods which ruled Sea and Land, bycause of their reuerence to Sunne and Moone, Elephants sa∣crificed and what follo∣wed therupō. and therefore Ptolomeus Philopator, offered foure Elephants in a sacrifice (to recouer the quietnesse of his mind) thinking that the Gods would haue beene well pleased therewith, but finding that his fearefull dreames and visions departed not from him, but rather his disquietnesse increa∣sed, fearing that the Gods were angry with him for that action he made foure Elephants of brasse, and dedicated them to the sun, Aelianus. Plutarch that so by this deede he might purchase pardon for the former offence. This religion of theirs, also appeareth before their death, for when they feele any mor∣tall woundes, or other naturall signes of their later end, either they take vp the dust, Tzetzes. or else some greene herbe, Plin us. Aelianus and lift it vp to heauen in token of their innocency and implorati∣on of their owne weakenes: and in like manner do they when they eate any herbe by na∣tural instinct to cure their diseases: first they lift it vp to the heauens (as it were to pray for a deuine blessing vpon it) and then deuoure it. I cannot omit their care, to bury and couer the dead carkases of their companions, or a∣ny other of their kind; Tzetzes. for finding them dead they passe not by them till they haue lamen∣ted their common misery, by casting dust and earth on them, and also greene boughes, in token of sacrifice, holding it execrable to doe otherwise: and they know by a naturall instinct▪ some assured fore-tokens of their owne death. Besides when they waxe old and vnfit to gather their owne meate, or fight for themselues the younger of them feed, nou∣rish, and defend them, yea they raise them out of Ditches and trenches into which they are fallen, exempting them from all labour and perill, and interposing their owne bodies for their protection: neither do they forsake them in sicknesse, or in their woundes, but stand to them, pulling Darts out of their bodies, and helping both like skilfull Chirurgi∣ans to cure their woundes, and also like faithfull friendes to supply their wants. Againe how much they loue their young which is a naturall part of religion we haue shewed before. Antipater supposeth that they haue a kinde of diuination or diuine vnder∣standing of law and equity, Plinyus. Their vnder∣standing of iustice and in equity for when King Bochus, had condemned thirty men to be torne and trod in pieces by Elephants, and tying them hand and foote to blocks or pieces of Wood, cast them among thirty Elephants, his seruants and officers could not by al their wit, skil, or prouocation, make the beasts touch one of them: so that it was apparant, they scorned and disdained to serue any mans cruell disposition, or to be the ministers of tyra∣ny and murther. Aelianus. The reuenge of adulteryes by Elephants They moreouer haue not onely an obseruation of chastity among them∣selues, but also are, reuengers of whoredome and adulterers in other, as may appeare by these examples in History. A certaine Elephant seeing his Maister absent, and another man in bedde with his Mistresse, he went vnto the bed and slew them both. The like was done at Rome where the Elephant hauing slaine both the adulterer and adulteresse, he couered them with the bed clothes vntill his keeper returned home and then by signes drew him into his lodging place, where he vncouered the adulterers, and shewed him his bloody tooth that tooke reuenge vpon them both for such a villany: whereat the maister wondering, was the more pacified because of the manifest-committed iniquity. And not onely thus deale they a∣gainst the Woman, but they also spare not to reuenge the adultery of men, yea of their owne keeper: for there was a rich man which had married a Wife not very amiable or louely, but like himselfe for wealth, riches, and possessions, which he hauing gained, first of all set his heart to loue another, more fitting his lustfull fancye, and being desirous to marry her, strangled his rich il-fauored Wife, and buried her not farre from the Ele∣phants stable, and so married with the other, and brought her home to his house: the Elephant abhorring such detestable murther, brought the new married Wife to the place vhere the other was buried; and with his teeth digged vppe the ground and shew∣ed her the naked bodye of her predecessour, intymating therby vnto her secretly, how vnworthely she had married with a man, murtherer of his former wife. Their loue and concord with all mankind is most notorious, especially to their kee∣pers and Women: Their loue o their kee∣pers and all men that harme them not. for if through wrath they be incensed against their keepers, they kill them, and afterwarde by way of repentance, they consume themselues with mourning: And for the manifesting of this point Arrianus telleth a notable story of an Indian, who had brought vp from a Foalea white Elephant, both louing it and being beloued of it a∣gaine, he was thereupon carried with great admiration. The king hearing of this White Elephant, sent vnto the man for it, requiring it to be giuen him for a present, whereat the man was much grieued, that another man should possesse that which he had so ten∣derly educated and loued, fitting him to his bowe and purposes, and therefore like a ryuall in his Elephants loue, resolued to deny the king, and to shift for himselfe in some other place: whereupon he fled into a desert region with his Elephant, and the king vn∣derstanding thereof, grew offended with him, sent messengers after him to take away the Elephant, and withall to bring the man backe againe, to receiue punishment for his con∣tempt. When they came to the place where he remained and began to take order for their apprehension, the man ascended into a steepe place and there kept the kings messengers off from him by casting of stones, and so also did the beast like as one that had receiued some iniury by them, at last, they got neare the Indian & cast him down, but the Eleph. made vpon them, killing some of them, and defending his maister and nourisher, put the residue to flight, and then taking vp his maister with his trunke carried him safe into his lodging, which thing is worthy to be remembred as a noble vnderstanding part both of a louing friend and faithfull seruant. The like may be said of the Elephant of Porus, carrying his wounded maister the king in the battel he fought with Alexander, for the beast drew the Darts gently out of his mai∣sters body without all paine, and did not cast him vntill he perceiued him to be dead and without blood and breath, and then did first of all bend his owne body as neare the earth as he could, that if his maister had any life left in him, he might not receiue any harme in his alighting or falling downe. Generally as is already said they loue all men after they be tamed, for if they meet a man erring out of his way they gently bring him into the right a∣gaine, Their loue to their keepers and al men that harme them not. yet being wilde are they afraide of the foot-steps of men if they winde their trea∣dings before they see their persons, and when they find an herbe that yeeldeth a suspition of a mans presence, they smell thereunto one by one, and if al agree in one sauour, the last beast lifteth vppe his voice and crieth out for a token and watchword to make them all flie away. Cicero affirmeth that they come so neare to a mans disposition, that their small company or Nation seemeth to ouergoe or equall most men in sence and vnderstan∣ding. At the sight of a beautifull woman they leaue off all rage and grow meeke and gentle, Their loue of beautiful wo¦men. and therefore Aelianus saith, that there was an Elephant in Egypt which was in loue with a woman that sold Corrals, the selfe same woman was wooed by Aristophanes, and there∣fore it was not likely that she was chosen by the Elephant without singular admiration of hir beauty, wherein Aristophanes might say as neuer man could, that he had an Elephant for his riuall, and this also did the Elephant manifest vnto the man, for on a day in the mar∣ket he brought her certaine Apples and put them into her bosome, Plutarch holding his Trunke a great while therein, handling and playing with her brests. Another likewise loued a Syrian woman, with whose aspect he was suddainely taken, and in admiration of her face stroked the same with his trunke, with testification of farther loue: the woman likewise failed not to frame for the Elephant amorous deuises with Beads and corals, siluer and such things as are gratefull to these brute beastes, so shee enioyed his labor and diligence to her great profit, and he hir loue and kindnes without al offence to his contentment, which caused Horat. to write this verse: Quid tibi vis mulier nigris dignissima barris. At last, the woman died, whom the Elephant missing, like a louer distracted betwixt loue and sorrow fell beside himselfe and so perished. Neither ought any man to maruel at such a passion in this beast, who hath such a memory as is attributed vnto him, and vnderstan∣ding of his charge and busines as may appeare by manifold examples, for Antipater affir∣meth that he saw an Elephant that knewe againe and tooke acquaintance of his maister which had nourished him in his youth, after many yeares absence. When they are hurt by any man, they seldome forget a reuenge, and so also they re∣mēber on the contrary to recompence al benefits as it hath bin manifested already. Their reuēge of harmes & obseruation of the mesure of their meat They obserue things done both in waight and measure, especially in their owne meate. Agnon writeth that an Elephant was kept in a great mans house in Syria, hauing a man appointed to bee his ouerseer, who did daily defraude the Beast of his allowance: but on a day as his maister looked on, he brought the whole measure and gaue it to him: the Beast seeing the same, and remembring howe he had serued him in times past, in the presence of his maister exactly deuided the corne into two parts, and so laied one of them aside: by this fact shewing the fraud of the seruant to his maister. The like storie is related by Plutarch and Aelianus, of another Elephant, discouering to his master the falshood and priuy theft of an vniust seruant. Strabo About Lycha in Affricke there are certaine springs of water, which if at any time they dry vp, by the teeth of Elephants they are opened and recouered againe. They are most gentle and meeke, neuer fighting or striking man or Beast, except they be prouoked, and then being angred they wil take vp a man in their trunke and cast him into the ayre like an Arrow, Gillius. so as many times he is dead before him come to ground. Plutarch affirmeth, that in Rome a boy pricking the trunke of an Elephant with a goad, the beast caught him, and lift him vp into the aire to shoote him away and kill him: but the people and standers by seeing it, made so great a noise and crye thereat, that the beast set him downe again faire and softly without any harme to him at all; as if he thought it sufficient to haue put him in feare of such a death. In the night time they seeme to lament with sighes and teares their captiuity and bon∣dage, Gillius. Philostratus. Their mour∣ning in secret Aristotle. The length of their life. Arrianus but if any come to that speede, like vnto modest persons they refraine suddenly, and are ashamed to be found either murmuring or sorrowing. They liue a long age, euen to 200. or 300. yeares, if sicknes or woundes preuent not their life: and some but to a 120. yeares; they are in their best strength of body at threescore, for then beginneth their youth. Iuba king of Lybia writeth, that he hath seene tame Elephantes which haue descended from the father to the sonne, (by way of inheritance) many generations: & that Ptolomae∣us Philadelphus had an Elephant, which continued aliue many Ages, and another of Se∣leuchus Nicanor, Aelianus. which remained aliue to the last ouerthrow of all the Antiochi. The inhabitants of Taxila in India affirme, that they had an Elephant at the least three hundred and fifty yeares old; for they said it was the same that fought so faithfully with Alexander for king Porus, for which cause Alexander cald him Aiax, & did afterward dedi∣cate him to the Sunne, and put certaine golden chaines about his teeth, with this inscrip∣tion vpon them: Alexander filius Iouis Aiacem soli: Alexander the sonne of Iupiter, con∣secrateth this Aiax to the Sunne. The like story is related by Iuba, concerning the age of an Elephant, which had the impression of a Tower on his teeth and was taken in Atlas 400. yeares after the same was engrauen. of the eating Elephants Strabo. There are certaine people in the world which eate Elephants, and are therefore called of the Nomades (Elephantophagi) Elephant-eaters, as is alreadye declared: there are of these which dwell in Daraba, neere the wood Eumenes, beyond the citty Saba, where there is a place (called the hunting of Elephants. The Troglodytae liue also heereupon, the peo∣ple of Affricke cald Asachae, Pliny. Solmus which liue in Mountains, do likwise eat the flesh of Elephants, and the Adiabarae or Megabari. The Nomades haue Citties running vpon Charriots, and the people next vnto their Territory, cut Elephantes in peeces, and both sell and eat them. Some vse the hard flesh of the backe, and other commend aboue all the delicates of the world the reines of the Elephants, va tomanus. so that it is a wonder that Aelianus would write, that there was nothing in an Elephant good for meat except the trunke, the lips and the mar∣row of his hornes, or teeth. The skin of this Beast is exceeding hard, not to be pierced by any dart; whereupon came the prouerbe Culicem haud curat Elephas Indicus, the Indian Elephant careth not for the biting of a Gnat, to signifie, a sufficient ability to resist all e∣uill, and that Noble minds must not reuenge small iniuries. The diseases elephants It cannot be but in such huge and vast bodies there should also be nourished some di∣seases, and that many (as Strabo saith) wherefore first of all ther is no creatur in the world lesse able to endure cold or winter, for their impatiency of cold bringeth inflamation. Al∣so in Summer, when the same is hotest, they coole one another by casting durty and fil∣thy water vpon each other, or else run into the roughest woods of greatest shadow. It hath bin shewed already that they deuour Chamaeleons, and thereof perish, except they eat a wild Oliue. When they suffer inflamation and are bound in the bellie, either black wine or nothing will cure them. When they drinke a Leach they are greeuously pained: for their wounds by darts or otherwise, they are cured by swines flesh, or Dittanie, or by Oile, or by the flower of the Oliue. They fall mad sometime, for which I knowe no other cure but to tye them vppe fast in yron chaines. When they are tired for want of sleepe they are recoue∣red by rubbing their shoulders with salt, Oile and water. Cowes milke warmed and infu∣sed into their eies, cureth all euils in them, and they presently like reasonable men ac∣knowledge the benefit of the medicine. The medicinall vertues in this beast are by Authours obserued to be these: The medi∣cines in Ele∣phants. Marcellus The blood of an Elephant and the ashes of a Weasill, cure the great Leprosie: and the same blood is profitable against all Rhewmaticke fluxes and the Sciatica. The flesh dryed and cold, or heauy fat and cold is abhominable: for if it be sod and st eped in vineger with fennel-seede, Isidorvs. Rasis and giuen to a Woman with child, it maketh her presently suffer abortement. But if a man tast thereof salted and steeped with the seede aforesaide, it cureth an old cough. The fatte is a good Antidote either by oyntment or perfume: Albertus it cureth also the payne in the head. The Iuory or tooth is cold and dry in the first degree, and the whole substance thereof Corroborateth the hart and helpeth conception; it is often adulterated by fishes and Dogges bones burnt, and by White marble. There is a Spodium made of Iuory in this manner. Take a pound of Iuory cut into pieces, and put into a raw new earthen pot, coue∣ring & glewing the couer with lome round about, and so let it burne til the pot be thrugh∣ly hardened: afterward take off the pot and beate your Iuory into small powder, and be∣ing so beaten, sift it, then put it into a glasse and poure vpon it two pound of distilled rose Water, and let it dry. Thirdly beate it vnto powder againe, and sift it the second time, and put into it againe so much rose water as at the first, then let it dry, and put thereunto as much Camphire as will lye vpon three or foure single Groats, and worke it altogether vpon a marble stone into little Cakes, and so lay them vp where the ayre may not corrupt and alter them. The vertue heereof is very pretious against spittyng of bloode, and the bloody-flixe, and also it is giuen for refrigeration without daunger of byndinge or astriction. After a man is deliuered from the lethargye, pestilence, or sudden forgetfulnesse, let him be purged and take the powder of Iuory and Hiera Ruffi, drunke out of sweete wa∣ter: This powder with Hony atticke, taketh away the spottes in the face: the same with wilde mints drunk with water, resisteth and auoydeth the Leprosie at the beginning. The powder of Iuory burnt and drunke with Goates blood, doeth wonderfully cure all the paynes, and expell the little stones in the raynes and bladder: Combes made of Iuory are most wholsome, the touching of the trunke cureth the headache: The liuer is profita∣ble against the falling euil, the same vertue hath the gall (if he haue any) against the falling euill. The fime by annointing, cureth a lowsie skin, and taketh away that power which breed∣eth these vermine: the same perfumed easeth Agues, helpeth a woman in trauaile, and driueth gnats or marsh-flyes out of a house. OF THE ELKE. A S the Elephant last handled could not liue in any countrey of the world but in the whot Esterne, and Sowtherne Regions, The place of their abode. Bonarus bar Balizce. so the Elke on the contrary is most impatient of all heate, and keepeth not but in the Northerne and cold contries: for Po∣lonia and the countries vnder that clymate will not preserue an Elke aliue, as it hath byn often tryed by experience: Countries breeding Elkes. for which cause, they are not found but in the colder Northerne regions; as Russia, Prussia, Hungaria, and Illiria, in the wood Hercynia, and among the Borussian-Scythians, but most plen∣tifully in Scandinauia, (which Pausanias calleth the Celtes ) for all the auncients called the Kingdomes of Germany and the North, Celtarum Regiones. Countryes inhabited by the Celts. This beast is called in Greeke Alke, and in Latine Alces, or Alce, The name of this beast. which was a name of one of Actaeons Dogges in Ouid : the Turkes, Valachians, the Hungarians, Iaius, the Illiri∣ans The figure of the Elke with hornes. and Polonians Los, in the singular, and plurally Lossie, for many Elkes. Albertus Mag∣nus calleth it Alches and Aloy, and afterward Equiceruus a Horsse-Hart. The Germans, Elch, An Elke the same that Machlis. Ellend, and Elent, by a metathesis of Alke, or Alce : and for my part, I take it to be the same beast which Pliny calleth Machlis, for there is nothing attributed to an Elke which al∣so doth not belong to Machlis. The Elke without hornes. I find not any vnreconcileable difference among authours concerning this beast, Caesars de∣scription of an Elke. ex∣cept in Caesar lib. 6. of his Commentaries, who by the relation of other (not by his owne fight) writeth that there are Elkes in the Hercynian wood, like vnto Goats in their spotted skins, who haue no hornes, nor ioynts in their legs to bend withall, but sleepe by leaning vnto trees like Elephants, because when they are downe on the ground they can neuer rise againe. But the truth is, that they are like to Roes or Hartes, because Goates haue no spotted skins, but Deere haue, and there may easily be a slip from Caprea a Roe, to Capra a Goat: and Caesar himselfe confesseth, that the similitude is in their spotted skins, which are not competible in Goats but in Roes. And whereas he writeth that they haue no Horns, the error of this relator may be this, that eyther he had onely seene a young one before the hornes came forth, or else an old one, that had lately lost his hornes; and by this I suppose that the authoritie of Cesar is su∣fficiently answered, so as we may proceed to the description of this beast collected out of the auncient writers, Pausanias; Vopiscus, Caesar and Solinus, Pliny and the later writers con∣senting with them in all thinges, (excepting Caesar in the two things aforesaid.) Albertus Magnus, Mathaeus, Michuanus, Seb. Munster, Erasmus, Stella, Iohannes Bonarus, Baoron of Balizce a Polonian, Iohannes Kentmannus, Io. Pontanus. Antonius Schnebergerus, Christopho∣rus Wirsungus, and that most worthy learned man Georgius Ioachimus of Rhaetia, and Baoron Sigismund. Pausanias supposeth it to be a beast betwixt a Hart and a Camell, Of the quan¦tity and sta∣ture. Bonarus. and Albertus betwixt a Hart and a Horsse; who therefore as it hath beene saide, calleth it Equi-ceruus, a Horsse-hart; but I rather by the hornes afterward described, and by the foot which Bonarus had, do take & hold it to be as bigge euery waie as two Hartes, and greater then a Horsse, The taming of Elks and their labor. be∣cause of the labour and qualities attributed thereunto: Whereunto also agreeth Alber∣tus. In Swedia and Riga they are tamed and put into Coaches or Charriottes to draw men through great snowes, and vpon the yse in the winter time they also are most swifte, Albertus. and will run more miles in one day, then a Horsse can at three. They were wont to be presents for princes, because of their singular strength and swiftnes, for which cause Alciatus rela∣teth in an emblem, the answer of Alexander to one that asked him a question about cele∣rity; whether hast doth not alway make wast: which Alexander denied by the example of the Elke in these Verses: Alciatae gentis insignia sustinet Alce Constat Alexandrum sic respondisse roganti. Nunquam inquit differre volens quod & indicat Alce Vnguibus & (meeden) fert (anaballomeenos) Qui tot obiuisset tempore gesta breui Fortior haes dubites, ocyor anne siet? Pliny affirmeth (in my opinion) verie truelie that this beast is like an Oxe, Of his partes and maner of feeding. Pliny. except in his haire, which is more like to a hart: his vper lip is so great and hangeth ouer the neather so farre, that he cannot eat going forward, because it doubleth vnder his mouth, but as hee eateth he goeth backward like a Sea-crabbe, and so gathereth vp the grasse that laie vnder his feet. His mane is diuers both vpon the top of his neck, and also vnderneath his throat it buncheth like a beard or curled locke of haire, howbeit, they are alwaie maned on the top of the necke. Their necke is verie short and doth not in answere to the proportion of the residue of the body, and therefore I haue expressed both figures of the Elkes. Their forehead is verie broad, two spans at the least: it hath two verie large hornes, which we haue heere also expressed, both for the right side and the left: so as they bende toward the backe in the plaine edge, and the spires or pikes stand forward to the face: both males and females haue hornes, they are solide at the root and round, but afterward bran∣ched, and grow out of their eie-lids, they are broader then a Harts, and are also verie hea∣uie, for they weigh at the least twelue pounds, and are not aboue two foote long, Munster. Kent mannus pontanus. and the bredth measured from the longest spiere to the other opposite side, about ten inches: the root next to the skin, is more then a man can well griple in his hand, and therefore here is expressed the figure of both hornes, both in male and female; for there is is not any dif∣ference in their natures that I can learne, and these hornes they loose euery yeare. His ears and back are verie long, and hanging down, the colour for the most part like a Hart, and sometime white, and Munster affirmeth, that in the Summer they are of russet color, and in the Winter browne or blackish coloured. Sigismundus Baro. Of the color His forelegs without all ioynts to bend, heerein resembling an Elephant, and therefore it sleepeth leaning to posts or Trees, and not lying on the ground. His hooues are clouen like a Harts, and with the forefeete he pierceth the Dogges that hunt him, for he fighteth not with his hornes, but with his fore∣legges. The manner of their fight It is a melancholycke beast and fearefull to be seene, hauing an ambling pace, and keeping in the wet, watry, and marshy places, delighting in nothing but in moysture. The place of his abode. The flesh is fat and sweete, but ingratefull to the palate, and engendereth melancholy. The Germans call this Beast Ellend, The name of this beast in the Germa n toong & the true sign fica¦tion thereof. which in their language signifieth miserable or wret∣ched, and in truth if the report thereof be not false, it is in a most miserable and wretched case, for euery daie thorough out the yeare it hath the falling sicknes, and continueth in the pangs thereof, vntill the hoofe of his right forefoote touch his left eare, which coms not to passe but by the extreame tormentes of the body, for whilst the members are rea∣ched and stretched with many straines and conuulsions (as it falleth out in that sickenesse) by chaunce the aforesaid foote rubbeth the saide eare, The sicknes of Elkes. and immediatelie thereupon the beast is deliuered from his panges: whereby we are to admire the workes of our creatour, which hauing laid so heauy an infirmity vpon this poore beast, wherewith he is daily tor∣mented, yet hath he also prouided a remedy for that euill in the hoofe of his owne foote, making the torments of the disease to be the apothecary for applying the remedy to the place of cure. They liue in heards and flockes together in Scandiuania, and when the waters are fro∣zen vp, the wilde mountaine Wolues set vpon them in great multitudes together, Their fight with Wolues whom they receiue in battell vpon the yse, fighting most fiercely and cruelly til one part be van∣quished: In the meane time the husbandmen of the countrey obserue this combate, and when they see one side goe to the wall, they persecute them, and take the victours part, for it is indifferent to take either the one side or the other; but most commonly the Elkes are conquerors by reason of their forefeet, for with them they pierce the Wolus or dogs skins, as with any sharpe pointed speare or Iauelyn. Some haue beene of opinion, that these are wilde Asses, but they are led hereinto with no reason, except because they are vsed for trauell and burthen as is before said, for there is no proportion or resemblance of body betwixt them: besides, they haue clouen hoofs, for the most part, although Sigismundus Baro affirme, that there are some of this kinde which haue their hooues whole and vndeuided. Being wilde it is a most fearefull crea∣ture, and rather desireth to lie hid in secret, then to flye, except pursued by hunters; The manner to hunt them without dan¦ger. and there is no danger in hunting of this beast exept a man come right before him, for on his sides he may safely strike and wound him, but if the beast fasten his forefeet on him, hee cannot escape without death. Notwithstanding it is a Beast (as hath been said) as great as two Harts, yet is it aboue measure fearefull, and if it receiue any small wound, or shot, their admira¦ble feare and pusillanimity instantly it falleth downe and yeeldeth to death, as Bonarus hunting with Sigismund the se∣cond king of Polonia in the woods of Lituania tryed with his owne hand, for with his hun∣ting spear he pierced one a very little way in the skin in the presence of the k. who present∣ly fell downe dead. In some countries of auncient time (sayeth Pausanias ) they tooke them on this maner. the auncient maner of ta∣king Elkes. They hauing found out the field or hill where the beasts are lodged, they compasse it in by the space of a thousand paces round in circle with welts and toils inuented for that pur∣pose, then do they draw in their nets round like a pursse, and so inclose the beasts by mul∣titude, who commonly smelling his hunters hideth himselfe in some deepe ditch or caue of the earth, for the nature of this beast hath framed to it selfe a most sharpe sagacity or quicke sent of smelling being not heerein inferiour to any of the best dogs in the worlde, because it can a great way off discouer the hunters, & many times while men are abroad in hunting of other beasts, this is suddainely started out of her lodging place, and so dis∣couered, chased, and taken. Other againe take it by the same meanes that they take Elephants, for when they haue found the trees whereunto they leane, they so cut and sawe them, that when the beast commeth, hee ouerthroweth them, and falleth downe with them, and so is taken a∣liue. We read that there were Elkes in the triumph of Aurelian at Rome, and in the games dedicated by Apollo and Diana and celebrated by Valerius Publicola, were many Eleph. Ʋopiscus. Elke and Tigres. Likewise there were ten Elkes at Rome vnder Gordianus. Their resist∣ance in the waters. When they are cha∣sed eagerly and can find no place to rest themselues in and lie secret▪ they run to the Wa∣ters, and therein stand, taking vp water into their mouths, and within short space doe so heate it, Munster. that being squirted or shot out of them vppon the Dogges, the heat thereof so opresseth and scaldeth them, that they dare not once approach or come nigh her any more. The medicin in an Elke. The greatest vertue of medicine that I can learne or finde to be in this beast, is in the hoofe, for that worne in a Ring, it resisteth and freeth a man from the falling euill, the Crampe, and cureth the fits or pangs, if it be put on when he is in his foming extremity: also scraped into powder and put into Wine and drunke, it is vsed in Polonia againste the same euill. In like sort they mingle it with Triacle, and applie it to the heart, or else hange it about their necke for an amulet to touch their skin against that disease: and because that both in auncient time, and also now a daies, this beast is sildome seene and more sildome taken, the hoofe thereof being so often approoued for the vses before said, the rarity (I say thereof) maketh it to be sold very deare, which would be (if they could be found or ta∣ken) in more plentifull maner. Some Mounte-bankes sell in steed therof a Bugles hoofe, but it may be easily descried by scraping, for (it is said) it smelleth very sweet, whereas a Bugles sauoureth very ill and strong. It is obserued also that it hath not this vertue except it be cut off from the beast while he is yet aliue, and that in the months of August and September, at what time these Elks are most of all annoyed with the falling sicknes, and then it hath strongest vertue to cure it in others. Others affirme, it wanteth his operation if it be cut off from a young one which neuer tasted of carnall copulation, and so hath not bin dulled thereby: but howsoeuer, this is certaine, that sometimes it cureth, and sometime it faileth, and as there can be giuen no good reason of the cure, so I rather ascribe it to a superstitious conceite or beleefe of the partie that weareth it, rather then to any hidden or assured worke of nature. The skinnes of this beast are dressed by Tawyers, with the fat of sishes and Alum, to make brest-plates, and to shelter one from raine, The vse of their skins. and they sell them for three or foure Nobles a piece; but in Cracouia for fifteen Florens. It may be discerned from a Harts skin by blowing vpon it, for the breath will come through like as in a Buffe, and the hairs of this beast haue also hol∣low passages in them when they grow vppon the backe of the beast, or else soone after the skin is taken off. Some also vse the nerues against the crampe, Ant. Schne∣hergerus. binding the offended member therwith, and heerewith doe we conclude this storie of an Elke, referring the reader to the fable of Alcida related before in Cacus if he haue desire to know it for the affinitie betwixt the name thereof and Alces an Elke. OF THE FERRET. I Take it to be most true without all exception, that the Graeci∣ans cal a Ferret Gala Agria, a wilde Weasill, Ictis and Phereoi∣kos, although Etymologus and Hesychius ascribe the reason of this latter name to her lodging vnder Oakes and Oliue-trees. The names in Greeke. Ictis also was a common name of all Weasils, to those Grae∣cians which neuer knew or saw any other then one kinde of them, or as Sclaliger against Cardan will haue it, to signifie a wilde Campestriall Weasill, and not a tame kind, being dome∣sticall and liuing in houses, and that these differ onely from one another in place and manner of liuing, and not in colour, stature or qualities. And where Aristophanes citeth it among other beasts which are deuourers of fish, in my opini∣on there is no beast that more desireth fish; then Ferrets and Cattes, and for this cause it hath his name Ictis quasi Ichthus, the etymolo¦gy of Ictys a Ferret. of eating of fish; and yet I cannot consent vnto them which wil haue it descend and hunt fish in the waters like Otters or Beauers: for it abhor∣reth both swimming or dyuing, Ferrets swim not. but neer to the waters it hunteth fish, where for the most part being wilde it remaineth. t e Latine names. The Latines call this beast Viuerra, and Furo, and Furetus, and Furectus, because (as shall be afterward manifested) it prey∣eth vppon Conies in their holes, and liueth vppon stealth, and in the earth will kil a cony six times as bigge as her selfe, but being abroad on the land, Their corage and nature in the earth. Scaliger. in the open air is nothing so wild, strong or ful of corage. From Ictys is deriued Iltissus, and the Germaine Iltis, for a Ferret: this is cald by the French Fu∣ron, Furet, and Fuson, and Fuset : by the Spaniards Furon, and Furam, and from the English Ferret is the Ger∣main Fret deriued by a common Syn∣cope, and in the time of Georgius Agri∣cola it was called in Germany Furette, and Frettell, and the English word see∣rueth also to be deriued from Fretta in Latine, which by a like Syncope is con∣tracted of Viuerra, as to any indiffe∣rent learned man it may appear at the first sight of deriuation. Whether Fer¦rits be Ictys. But heerein seemeth an vnreconci∣lable difference, that it is reported of the Ictys by Gaza, the interpretour of Aristotle, that it was most greedye of Hony, and for that cause it will seeke out the hyues of Bees, and enter them without all feare of stings. But when Pliny speaketh of Ictys, he doth not cal it Viuerra, or once attribute vnto it the loue of honie, but rather the hatered and loathing thereof, in so high a de∣gree, that if he tast of it, he falleth in∣to consumptions, and hardly escapeth death. And these things Scaliger alled∣geth against Cardan, onely to prooue that Ictys and Viuerra, are two destinct beasts, & that Cardan was mistaken in affirming, that they were but seuerall names, expressing one and the same beast. The answere whereunto may be ve∣ry easie, for althogh Pliny leaueth with out rehersal their loue of hony, it doth not necessarily follow, that they loue it not (as Aristotle before him constant¦ly affirmeth) and Scaliger nameth no author, nor bringeth any reason to de∣monstrate their hate of honey, or any harme which insueth them by eating thereof: and therefore against his au∣thority may Strabo be opposed, who in his thired booke, speaking of the Conies of Spaine, and of their hunters and starters, out of their holes, he taketh and nameth indifferently without all distinction and excepti∣on, Viuerra, and Ictys, for the one and other. Niphus translateth Ictys, a Martall, but with∣out reason; for the same man finding in Aristotle that there is War betwixt Locusts and Serpentes, which is fitly called Ophiomachia ; whereas Aristotle nameth Akris a Locust, hee falleth in doubt whether it were not better to be Ictys a Martell, or as other copies haue it Aspis an Aspe, which can by no meanes agree vnto them, for there is a kind of Lo∣custs (called Ophiomachum ) because of their continual combats with Serpents. And there∣fore not to stande any longer vppon this difference, ommitting also the coniecture of Tzetzes, which confoundeth Ictys with Miluus a Glead or Kyte, which canot stand reaso∣nable, because Homer saith there was a kind of caps made of the haires of Ictys, nor yet of Albertus his newe found name of Ankatinos nor Auicenna his Katyz, or the french Fissau which is a Poul-cat. I will descend to the description of the parts and qualities, wherein the Authors them∣selues at variance, make their owne reconcilement, by attributing the same things to the Ictya and Ferret, except that of an obscure authour, which saith that Ictys is Ankacinor, as big as a Grey-hound, and that it is wiser & more industrious in his youth and tender age, then in his perfection of strength and yeares. These Ferrets are lesser then the Maelitean or Gentlewomens Dogs, and they were firste of all brought out of Affricke into Spaine, and therefore are called by Strabo, Affrican wea∣sils, G z Their seue∣ral partes. because of their similitude with Weasils: for Spaine, Italy, France, and Germany, haue not this beast bred among them, but brought to them out of other Countries. But in En∣gland they breed naturally of the quantity aforesaid, and they are tamed to hunt Conies out of the earth. Countrey of breed. It is a bolde and audatious beast, enemy to all other except his owne kind, drinking and sucking in the blood of the beast it biteth, but eateth not the flesh. When the Warriner setteth it downe to hunt, I dorus. Per ttus. Their drink∣ing or bloud. Agricola. Their prouo¦cation to hūt hee first of all maketh a great noise to fray all the Conies that are abroad into their holes, and so hauing frighted them pitcheth his nets, & then putteth his tame Ferret into the earth, hauing a long string or cord with bels about hir necke, whose mouth he muzzleth, that so it may not bite the cony, but onely terrifie her out of her borough and earth with her presence or clawes; which being perfourmed, she is by Dogs chased into the nets, and there ouerwhelmed, as is aforesaid in the history of the conies. Theyr body is longer for the proportion then their quantity may affoord, for I haue seen them two spans long but very thin and smal. Their colour and eyes Their colour is variable, somtime black, and white on the belly, but most commonly of a yellowish sandy colour, like hermeline or wooll, died in vrine. The head little like a mouses, and therefore into whatsoeuer hole or chinke she putteth it in, all her body will easily follow after. The eies small, but fiery, like red hot yron, and therefore she seeth most clearely in the darke: Her voyce is a why∣ning cry, neither doth she chaunge it as a Cat: She hath onely two teeth in the neather chap, standing out and not ioyned or growing together. The genital of the male is of a bo∣ny substance (wherein Pliny and Scaliger agree with Cardan and Straho for the Ictys also) & therefore it alway standeth stiffe, and is not lesser at one time then at other. The pleasure of the sence in copulation is not in the yard or genital part, but in the nerues, muscles, and tunicles wherein the said genitall runneth. When they are in copulation the female lyeth downe or bendeth her knees, and continually cryeth like a Cat, either because the Male pincheth and claweth her skin with his sharpe nailes, or else because of the rigidity of his genitall. The number of their yong ones. And when the female desireth copulation, except shee bee with conuenient speede brought to a Male, or he suffered to come to her, she swelleth and dyeth. They are very fruitfull in procreation, for they bring foorth seauen or eight at a time, bearing them in their littie belly not aboue fortie daies. The young ones newly littered are blind 30. daies togither, and within 40. daies after they can see, they may be set to hun∣ting. The noble men of France keep them for this pleasure, who are greatly giuen to hunt conies, and they are sold ther for a French crown. Young boies and schollers also vse them to put them into the holes of rockes and Walles to hunt out Birdes, and likewise into hol∣low Trees where out they bring the Birds in the clawes of their feet. They are nourished being tamed with milke, Their food or with barlie breade, and they can fast a very long time. When they go, they contract their long backe and make it stand vpright in the middle, round like a bowle. When they are touched, they smell like a Martell, and they sleepe very much: being wilde, they liue vpon the blood of conies, Hennes, Chic∣kens, Hares, or other such things, which they can finde and ouermaister. In their sleepe also they dreame, which appeareth by whyning and crying in their sleepe, whereas a long fly (called a Fryer) flying to the flaming candels in the night, is accounted among poy∣sons, the Antidote and resister thereof is by Pliny affirmed to be a Goats gall or liuer, The medi∣cines of Fer∣rets. mix∣ed with a Ferret, or wilde Weasill, and the gall of Ferrets is held pretious against the poi∣son of Aspes, although the flesh and teeth of a ferret be accounted poyson. Likewise the gall of a Ferret is commended against the falling disease, and not onely the gal (saith Mar∣cellus ) but the whole body, if it be rosted, dressed, and eaten fasting, like a young pig. It is said by Rasis and Albertus, that if the head of a wolfe be hanged vp in a doue-cote, neither cat, Ferret, weasil, Stoate, or other noysom beast dare to enter therein. These ferrets are kept in little hutches, in houses and there fed, where they sleepe much: they are of a very whottemperature or constitution, and therefore quickly disgest their meate, and being wild by reason of their fear, they rather seeke their meat in the night then in the day time. OF THE FITCH OR POVL-CAT. T He difference of a Poul-cat from the wild-cat, Isidorus. The name & the notation thereof. is because of her strong stin∣king sauour, and therefore is called Putorius of Putore because of his ill smell: for al weasils being incensed and prouokt to wrath, smell strongly, & especially the Poul-cat; likewise when in the spring time they endeuour procreation, for which cause among the Germans (when they would ex∣presse an infamous Whoore or whoore-maister) they say they stinke like an Iltis that is a fitch or Poul-cat. The French call this beast Putois, and Poytois, as it is to be found in Ca∣rolus Figulus, the Sauoyens Pouttett, the Illirians and Bohemians Tchorz, and the Polo∣nians Vijdra ; and Scaliger calleth it in Latine ( Catum fuinam ) by another name thē Puto∣rius. It is greater then an ordinary weasill, but lesser then the wilde Martell, The quanti∣ty and nature of this b st Stumpsius Agricola and yet com∣monly fatter: the haires of it are neither smooth and of one length, or of one colour; for the short haires are somewhat yellowish, and the long ones blacke, so as one would thinke that in many places of the body, there were spottes of diuers colours, but yet about the mouth it is most ordinarily white. The skin is stiffe, harsh, and rugged in handling, and therefore long lasting in Gar∣ments, yet because the beast is alwaie fat, the sauor of it is so rank, The skins & vse of them. that it is not in any great request, and moreouer it is said that it offendeth the heade, and procureth ache therein; and therefore it is sold cheaper then a Foxe skinne, and the fattest is alway the worst of all. The skinners approue the skins of fitches and Martils best, which are killed in winter, be∣cause their flesh and lust is much lower, and therefore rendereth a lesse hurtfull smell then at other times. The taile is not aboue two handes or palmes long, and therefore shor∣ter then is a Martilles. In all other partes of the bodye it equalleth a Martill, or ex∣ceedeth very little, hauing thinner Neckes, but larger and greater Bellies, the Taile, Legges, and breast, are also of a blacker colour, but the belly and sides, more yellow. Some haue deliuered that the left legges thereof are shorter then the right legs, but this is founde vntrue by daily experience: They keepe in the toppes of houses and secret corners, delighting to kil and eat hens and chickens, whose craft in deuouring his prey is singular, I lorus. Their meate and subtletie not to be descryed for to the intent that the silly creatures to be deuoured may not bewray them to the house-keepers, the first part that they lay hold vpon with their mouths is the heade of the hen and chicken, and by that means stayeth his crying by cropping off the head. Some of these Fitches wander and keep in the woods, and thereby liue vpon birds and mise, and such things: some againe liue by the Sea sides in rockes, and they take Fishes, like Beuers and Otters: and some creepe into the caues of hollow trees, where they eat Frogges, and most of all they delight to be neare stals of cattel, hay-houses, and houses, where they meet oftentimes with Egs, wherein they delight aboue al other kinds of meat. And thus much for this beast. OF THE FOX. A Fox is called in Haebrew Schual, and in Chaldee Thaal, The seueral names of fox¦es in sundry languages. and therefore in Psal, 61. where the Haebrew readeth Schualim, there the Chaldee translateth it Thealaia, the Arabians call him Thaleb, and Auicen calleth a Foxe sometime Chabel, and also Chalca l ; the Greeke Septuagints Alopekon, and vulgar∣ly Alopex, and Alopon, the Latines Vulpes, and Vulpecula of Volipes his tumbling pace, the Italians Volpe, the French Reg¦nard, and a little Foxe Regnardeau ; the Spaniards Raposa of rauening; the Germans Fuchs, the Flemings Vos, and the Il∣lyrians Liss a. The Epithets expressing the nature hereof among writers, both poets and others, are these: crafty, wary, deceitfull, stinking, strong-smelling, quicke-smelling, tayled, The epithits of Foxes war∣like or contentious, wicked and rough, the Graecians fiery colored, and subtil for slaugh∣ter, and therfore Christ called Herod a Fox, because he vnderstood how by crafty means he sought to entrap and kil him: and al the auncientes called such kind of men Vulpiones, which euery nation vnder heauen doth imitate. There are store of Foxes in the Alpine regions of Heluetia, the Centries breeding Foxes. Aelianus. and amongst the Caspians they abound, so that their multitude maketh them tame, comming into the Citties, and attending vpon men like tame Dogs. The Foxes of Sardinia are very Rauenous, for they kil the strongest Rams and Goats, and also young Calues, and in Egypt they are lesser then they are in Graecia, and most commonly all Foxes are of stature like to a sheapheards dog. Munster. Their colour is reddish and more white toward the head: In Moscouia are both blacke & white, Viz: about the riuer Woga, blacke and ash-coloured, Aristotle. Albertus. The colour of Foxes and in the prouince of Vsting al black, & these are of the smaller sort, which are norished to make caps of their skins, and are therfore sold at twenty or thirty Florens a skin. In Spaine they are al white, and their skins are often brought by the merchants to be sold at Franchford mart. In the Septentrionall or Northern woods, there are black, white, and red Foxes, Olaus mag▪ and such as are cald Crucigerae, that is Crosse-bearing Foxes, for on their backs & orethwart their shoulders there is a blacke crosse, like an Asses: and there are Foxes aspersed ouer with blacke spots, and al these are of one and the same malignaunt and crafty nature: and these (saith Georg▪ Fabritius ) are distinguished by their regions or habitations: for it is most commonly seene, that Foxes which keepe and breed toward the South and West, are of an ash colour, and like to Wolues, hauing loose hanging haires, as is to be seene both in Spaine and Italy; and these are noted by two names among the Germaines, from the colour of their throats. One kind of them is called Koler, whose throat seemeth to be sprinkled and darkned with cole-dust, vpon white, so as the tops of the hair apeare blacke, the foot and stalke being white. The other Birkfuchse, because their throat is al white, and of this kind the most splen∣dent white, is most pretious. A second there is (called Kreutzfuchse ) because of the crosse it beareth vpon his backe and shoulders downe to his forefeet, being in other partes like the former, except the throat which is blacker then any of the other before spoken of, and these are not bredde in Germany, but brought thither from other nations. A third kind is of a bright skie-colour (called Blauwfusche ) and this colour hath gi∣uen a different name to Horsses, which they call Blauwschimmell, but in the Foxes it is much more mingled, and these foxes which haue rougher and deeper haire are called Braudfuchse. The Moscouians and Tartarians make most account of the blacke skins, because their prin∣ces and great Nobles weare them in their garments: yet are they more easily adulterated and counterfaited by the fume or smoke of Torches made of pitch. The white and blewe skins are lesse esteemed, because the haire falleth off, and are also lesser then the other: the red ones are most plentifull, and Scaliger affirmeth, that he saw skins brought into Fraunce by certaine merchants, which had diuers white haires disposed in rowes very elegantlye vpon them, and in diuers places they grew also single. In Noruegia and Suetia as there are white Harts and Beares, so there are also white foxes; In Wolocha they are black, as it is af∣firmed by Sigismundus Liber, the picture of the Cross-bearing-fox which is lesse then the former is heere following expressed and set downe. THE CRVCIGERAN FOXE. S Erpents, Apes, and Foxes, and al other dangerous harmeful beasts, haue small eies, Adamantius The parts and nature of Foxes. but sheepe and Oxen which are simple, very great eyes. The Germans when they discribe a good Horsse, they deci∣pher in him the outward parts of many beastes, from whom (it see∣meth) he partaketh his generosity, and from a Foxe they ascribe vn∣to him short eares, a long and bushy taile, and easie and soft treading step, (for these belong to a Foxe.) The male Foxe hath a hard bony genitall, Aristotle. his taile is long and hairy at the end, his temperament or constitution is whot, as appeareth both bycause of his resemblance or similitude with Dogges and Weasils, and also his ranke and stronge smelling sauour; for being dead, his skinne hath power in it of heating, and his fat or oyle after a decoction is of the same force & condition. The greatest occasion of his hunting is the benefit of his skinne, for his flesh is in all things like a Dogs, The flesh of Foxes euil to be eaten. and although Galen, Mnesimachus, and Silutus affirme, that in the Au∣tume or latter part of the yeare, some men vse to eate the flesh of Foxes, (especially be∣ing Cubs) that is young, tender, and not smelling: but Aetius and Rasis affirme, (and that with great reason) that their flesh, and the flesh of Hedg-hogs and Hares, is not agreea∣ble to the nature of man. But their skinne retaineth the qualities of the whot beast being pulled off, by reason of the long and soft haire growing thereupon; The vse of their skinnes and the skins of Cubs which are preferred before the elder, are of least value, because their haire is apt to fall off, which being thin doth not admit any deepe rootings of the haire. The Thracians in the time of Xenopho , wore Caps of Foxes skinnes vpon their heades and eares, in the coldest and hardest win∣ters, and from hence it commeth, that in some Authors the couers of mens heads, (com∣monly called in Greeke Pericephalaea ) are termed Alopecia, or Alopeci and for this pur∣pose in Germany at this day, they slit asunder the skin of foxes tailes, and sow it together againe, adding to it a sufficient number till it be framed into a cap: but the skin of the bel∣ly and sides is of more pretious estimation, because it is more soft and smooth, and there∣fore is sold for twice so much as the other parts. In the Summer time the skinnes are little worth, because that then the beasts are trou∣bled with the Alopecia, that is, the falling off or loosenesse of the haire; and therefore then also they are daungerous to bee vsed, because of that disease: men which haue the gout, shrinking vp of the sinnewes, or other cold fluxions of the Rhewme in their Legs, can use no better or more wholesome thing then to weare buskins of the skins of Foxes; Alev. ab alex the Scy∣thians make them shooes, and soale them with the backes of Foxe and Myse skinnes, vp∣on which they go. The Latines haue a proper word for the voyce of a Fox, which is Gan∣nio Gannire, to Ganne, and it is also metaphorically applyed to men, when by scrietching clamours they trouble others; as Terence in Adelph: quid iile gannit? Quid vult? donotus The voyce of Foxes. And Plautus also; Gannit odiosus omni toti familiae, and for this voyce did Mantuan Write this verse: Putes vlutare lupos, gannire sagaces -vulpeculos. But yet as Albertus and Constantinus haue truely obserued, that in the time of his hun∣ger he will barke like a little Dogge, and the Harts are greatly afraid of this ganning of Foxes. It hath beene already shewed in the story of the Badger, how the Foxe by laying his ex∣crements in the Badgers den, getteth the same to his owne vse; Their d ns & caues in the earth. Gillius. Oppianus for the abode of Foxes in the day time is in the caues and holes of the earth, and come not abroad til the night. These dens haue many caues in them, and passages in and out, that when the Tertars shall set vpon him in the ear h▪ he may go forth some other way: and forasmuch as the Wolfe is an enemy to the Foxe, he layeth in the mouth of his den, an Herbe (called Sea-onyon) which is so contrary to the nature of a Wolfe, and he so greatly terrified therewith, Zoroastres Gillius. that hee will neuer come neere the place where it either groweth or lyeth; the same is affirmed of the Turtle to saue her young ones, but I haue not read that Wolues will prey vpon Tur∣tles, and therefore we reiect that as a fable. When Aristomanes was taken by the Lacaedemonians, Pliny. and included into a rocke or qua∣rey of stones, he escaped out of their handes, by digging another passage out of it then where he was put in; saying, that it was a shame for a man to haue lesse wit then a fox. When they are in their dens, they lye vpon their bellies with their hinder Legges stret∣ched forth at length, like as a man when he sleepeth on his belly, and therefore it seemeth that their legs are so framed to creepe and pierce vnder the earth and dig out their way after their owne pleasure. This is such a deuouring beast that it forsaketh nothing fit to be eaten, The food of Serpents for it killeth Hares and Connies, and with his breath draweth fielde Myce out of their holes like as a Hart draweth out Serpents with his breath, and deuoureth them. He deuoureth also all kind of Pullen, they also eate Grapes, Apples, and Peares, whereupon came the prouerbe in Plautus, Tam facile vinces quam vulpes pyrum comest. Thou shalt as easily ouercome him, as a Foxe eateth a Peare: which is applyed to any easie or dispatchable businesse. In Ara∣bia, and Syria Palaestina, they are so rauenous, harmefull, and audacious, that in the night by ganning and barking, they inuite one another (as it were) by a Watchworde, to as∣semble in great multitudes together, for to prey vpon all things, and they feare not to car∣ry into their dens, old shooes and vessels, or instrumentes of husbandry: for which cause, when the husbandmen heare therof, they gather all thinges into their houses and watch them. But as it falleth out in all gluttonous rauening persons, that while they striue to fil their bellies, they poison their liues, so also it fareth with Foxes, for nature hath so ordained, The harme of Foxes. that if a Foxe eat any meat wherein are bitter Almondes, they die thereof, if they drinke not presently: and the same thing do Aloes in their meate worke vppon them, Discorides. as Scaliger affirmeth vpon his owne sight or knowledge Apocynon or Bear foot giuen to dogs, wolues, Serapio. Foxes, and all other beasts which are littered blind, in fat or any other meat killeth them, if vomit helpe them n t, which falleth out very sieldome, and the seeds of this hea be haue the same operation. It is reported by Democritus, that if wilde r e be secretly hu ge vnder a Hens wi g no Fox wil meddle with her, and the same writer also declareth for approo∣ued, that if you mingle the gal of a Fox, or a cat, with their ordinary foode, they shall re∣maine free from the the d ngers of these beasts. When they engender and admit copulation, they are ioyned like dogs, Their carnal copulation. the male vpon the female: and the female when she perceiueth her wombe filled, shee departeth and liueth very secret, for it falleth out very seldome that a female or Bitch-Foxe is taken great with young. She bringeth forth ordinarily foure at a time, and those blinde and imperfect, without Articles in their Legges, which are perfected and framed by licking, for Beares, Wolues, Lyons, Foxes, Dogges, and Thoes which are Multipara and Multifida, that is fruitefull, bearinge many at one time, and also Clouen or slitte-sooted, into many clawes, haue not the benefit of nature to perfect their young ones in their wombes. Kytes, vultures, and Eagles lye in wayt to destroy the Foxes Cubs or Whelpes. Fox∣es do not onely engender with their owne kinde, but also with Wolues, Dogges, or any other beastes of equall proportion, both of quantity and time of going with yong, so the Laconian Dogs are engendered by a Dogge and a Foxe, and the Hyaena, of a Wolfe and a Foxe (as Albertus affirmeth) and the Simiuulpa of an Ape and a Foxe, as is already in the story of Apes declared. There be also many euils wherewithall Foxes are annoyed, and first of all he falleth sometime into madnesse as a Dogge, The diseases of Foxes. and the same euils follow a madde Foxe, which al∣ready are manifested to accompany a mad Dog, and that more often in Summer then in winter. Albertus. Albert. Liber Aetius. When a Foxe feeleth himselfe sicke, nature hath taught him to eate the gum of Pine∣trees, wherewithall he is not onely cured, but also receiueth length of daies. They are al∣so vexed with the falling away of their haire, called therefore Alopecia, because Foxes are most commonly vexed therewith, and as we see in plantes, that some of them drye and consume through want of moysture to feede them, other are suffocated and choaked by aboundance, and as it were drowned in humidity: so it happeneth in haire, which grow∣eth out of the body of beastes, and the heades of men, no otherwise then plants out of the earth, and are therefore to be nourished by humours; which if they faile and waxe drye, the haire also shorteneth with them, and as it were rotteth away in length: but if they a∣bound and ouerflowe, then do they loosen the rootes of the haire, and cause them to fall off totally. This disease is called Alopecia, and the other Ophiasis, because it is not generall, but on∣ly particular in one member or part of the body or head, & there it windeth or indenteth like a Serpents figure. Mychaell Ferus affirmeth, that sometime the liuer of the Foxe inflameth, and then it is not cured but by the vlcerous blood flowing to the skin, and that euill blood causeth the Alopecia, or falling away of the haire, for which cause (as is already said) a Foxes skin is lit∣tle worth that is taken in the summer time. The length of the life of a Foxe is not certainely knowen, yet as Stumpsius and others affirme, The length of their life. it is longer then the life of a Dog. If the vrine of a Foxe fall vpon the grasse or o∣ther Herbs it drieth and killeth them, and the earth remaineth barren euer afterward. The sauour of a Foxe is more strong then of any other vulgar beast, he stincketh at Nose and taile, Varinus for which cause Martiall calleth it Olidam Vulpem, an Olent or smelling beast. Hic olidam clamosus ages in retia vulpem. Touching the hunting or taking of Foxes, I approue the opinion of Xenophon, who a∣uoucheth, The hunting and taking of Foxes. leporum capturam venatico studia quam vulpium digniorem ; that is, the Hun∣ting of the Hare is a more noble game or pastime then the hunting of the Foxe. This beast is more fearefull of a Dogge then a Hare, for the onely barking of Dogges causeth him to rise many times from his denne or lodgings out of the earth, or from the middle of bushes, Aelianus briars, and brambles, wherein he hid himselfe: and for his hunting this is to be obserued; Oppianus that as in hunting of a Hart it hath beene already related, the Hunter must driue the beast with the winde, because it hindereth his refrigeration, so in hun∣ting of a Foxe he driue him againe the winde, and then he preuenteth all his crafty and subtill agitations and diuises; for it stayeth his speede in running, and also keepeth his sa∣uour fresh alway in the Nose of the Dogs that follow him: Dellisarius. for the Dogges that kill a Fox must be swifte, stronge, and quicke sented, and it is not good to put on a few at once, but a good company together, for be assured the Foxe will not loose his owne blood till hee hazzard some of his enemies, and with his taile which he windeth euery way, doth hee delude the hunters: when the Dogs are pressed neere vnto him, and are ready to bite him, Text r. he striketh his taile betwixt his Legs, and with his owne vrine wetteth the same, and so in∣stantly striketh it into the dogs mouths, whereof when they haue tasted, so many of them as it touched will commonly leaue off and follow no farther. Their teeth are exceeding sharp, and therefore they feare not to assault or contend with beasts, exceeding their stature, strength, and quantity. Somtime he leapeth vp into a tree, and there standeth to be seene and bayed at by the Dogs and Hunters, Oppianus like as a Champi∣on in some fort or Castle, and although fire be cast at him, yet will he not discend down a∣mong the dogs; yea, he endureth to be beaten and pierced with Hunters speares, but at length being compelled to forsake his holde and giue ouer to his enemies, downe he lea∣peth, falling vpon the crew of barking Dogs, like a flash of lightning, and where he layeth hold there he neuer looseth teeth, or aswageth wrath, til other dogs haue torne his limbs, and driuen breath out of his body. If at any time he take the earth, then with Terriour dogges they ferret him out of his den againe. In some places they take vpon them to take him with nets which sildome pro∣ueth, because with his teeth he teareth them in pieces; yet by Calentius this deuise is allo∣wed in this verse: Et laqueo Vulpes & decipe casse foïnas. But this must be wrought vnder the earth in the caues, dennes, or furrowes, made of pur-which is to be performed two manner of waies, one by placing the gin in some perch of Wood, so as that assoone as the beast is taken by the Necke, it may presently fly vp and hang him, for otherwise with his teeth hee will sheare it asunder and escape away aliue: or else that neere the place where the rope is fastened, to slippe vppon the heade of the Foxe, there bee placed some thicke collor or brace, so as hee can neuer bite it asun∣der. The French haue a kind of Ginne to take them by the Legges (which they call Hausepi∣ed ) and I haue heard of some which haue found the Foxes Legge in the same Gin, A noble in∣stance of a Foxes corag bit∣ten off with his owne teeth from his body, rather putting himselfe to that torment with his owne teeth, then to expect the mercy of the Hunter, and so went away vppon three feet: and other haue counterfeited themselues dead, restraining their breath and winking, not stirring any member when they saw the Hunter come to take them out of the Ginne, The subtlery of a Fox take in a snare. who comming and taking his Legge forth, not suspecting any life in them, so soone as the Foxe perceiueth himselfe free, away hee went and neuer gaue thankes for his deliue∣rance: for this cause Blondus saith truely, that onely wise and olde Hunters are fit to take Foxes, for they haue so many deuises to beguile men, and deliuer themselus, that it is hard to know when he is safely taken vntill he be throughly dead. They also vse to set vp Ginnes for them bayted with Chickens in Busnes and Hedges: but if the setter be not at hand so soone as the Foxe is insnared, it is daungerous but that the beast will deliuer it selfe. In some places againe they set vp an iron toyle, hauing in it a ring for the foxe to thrust in his head, and through that sharpe pikes, at the farther end whereof is placed a piece of flesh, so that when the hungry foxe commeth to bite at the meate and thrusteth in his head, the pikes sticke fast in his necke, and he ineuitably insna∣red: Moreouer as the harmefulnesse of this beast hath troubled many, so also they haue deuised moe engins to deceiue and take him; for this cause there is another pollicy to kill him by a bowe, full bent, with a sharpe arrow, and so tenderly placed as is a trap for a Mouse, and assoone as euer the foxe treadeth thereon, presently the arrow is discharged into his owne bowels, by the waight of his foote. Againe, for the killing of this beast they vse this sleight, they take of Bacon-grease or Bacon as much as ones hand, and rost the same a little, and therewith annoint their shoe∣soles, and then take the Liuer of a Hogge cut in pieces, and as they come out of the wood where the beast lodgeth, they must scatter the said pieces in their foote-steps and drawe the carcasse of a dead Cat after them, the sauour whereof will prouoke the beast to follow the foot-steps, then haue they a cunning Archer or handler of a Gunne, who obserueth and watcheth in secret till the Beast come within his reach, and so giueth him his great & deadly wound. But if the Fox be in the earth, and they haue found his denne then they take this course to worke him out. They take a long thing like a Bee-hiue, and open at one end, and yron wiers at the other like a grate, and at the open end is set a little doore to fall downe vppon the mouth, and to inclose the Fox when he entereth in by touching of a small rod that sup∣porteth that doore. This frame is set to the Foxes dens mouth, and all the other passages watched and stopped. The Fox hauing a desire to go forth, & seeing light by the wiers, mis¦deemeth no harme, and entereth into the hiue which is wrought close into the mouth of his den, and being entered into it, the rodde turneth the dore fast at the lower end or en∣traunce, and so the fox is intrapped, to be disposed of at the will of the taker. The beast s ∣miesf Foxes are annoied with many enemies, and to beginne with the least, the small flies and called gnats do much trouble and infect them, against whome the foxe vseth this policie: He taketh a mouthful of straw or soft hay, or haire, and so goeth into the water, dipping his hinder parts, by litle and litle, then the flies betake themselues to his heade, which he kee∣peth out of water, which the fox feeling, dippeth or diueth also the same vnder water to his mouth, Albertus wherein he holdeth the hay as aforesaid, whereunto the flies runneth for sanctuary or dry refuge, which the fox perceiuing, suddenly casteth it out of his mouth, and runneth out of the water, by this meanes easing himselfe of al those enemies. In like manner, as al beasts are his enemies, and hee friend and louing to none, so with strength, courage, and policie, he dealeth with euery one, not onely against the beastes of the land, but also against the monsters of the sea. When he findeth a neast of waspes in the earth, or in other places, as in Trees, he laieth his taile to the hole, and so gathereth into it a great many of them, which he presently dasheth against the Wall, or Tree, or stones ad∣ioyning, and so destroyeth them, and thus he continueth vntill he haue killed them al, and so maketh himselfe execute to their heapes of hony. Gillius His manner is when he perceiueth or seeth a flocke of foule to flye in the aire, to rowle himselfe in red earth, making his skin to looke bloody, and lie vpon his backe, winking with his eie, and holding in his breath as if he were dead, which thing the birds, namely Crows, Rauens and such like obseruing, because of the hatred of his person, they for ioy alight & triumph at his ouerthrow, and this the fox indureth for a good season, till oportunity ser∣uing his turne, and some of the fowle come neare his snowt, then suddenly hee catcheth some one of them in his mouth, feeding vpon him like a liuing and not a dead foxe, and so doth deuoure and eate him, as the Leopard doth deuoure and eate Apes, and the Sea-frog other little fishes. In like sort he deceiueth the Hedgehogge, for when the hedghog perceiueth the foxe comming to him, he rowleth himselfe togither like a foote-ball, and so nothing appeareth outward exeept his prickles, which the fox cannot indure to take into his mouth, and then the crafty fox to compasse his desire, licketh gently the face and snowt of the Hedgehogge, by that meanes bringing him to vnfold himselfe againe, and to stand vpon his legs, which being done, he instantly deuoureth, or else poisoneth the beast with the vrine that he ren∣dereth vpon the Hedgehogges face: and at other times hee goeth to the waters, and with his taile draweth fishes to the brimme of the Riuer, and when that he obserueth a good boo∣ty, hee casteth the Fishes cleane out of the water vppon the dry lande, and then devoureth them. All kinds of Hawkes are enemies to foxes, and foxes to them, because they liue vppon Carrion, and so in the prouince of Vla. Auicen saw a fox and a Crow fight together a longe season, and the Crow with his talentes so bee gripling the foxes mouth, that he coulde not barke, and in the meane time she beat and picked his head with her bill vntil he bled againe. The Eagles fight with foxes and kil them, and Olaus Magnus affirmeth, that in the Northern Regions they lay Egges and hatch their young in those skinnes which they themselus haue stripped off from foxes and other beasts. The Kites, Vultures, and wolues are enemies to foxes, because they are al flesh-deuouring-creaturs, but the fox which hath so many enemies, by strength or subtilties ouer commeth al Whereupon Persius calleth a subtill man a Foxe; saying, Astutam vapido seruas sub pectore vulpem. The medicinall vses of this beast are these: first, (as Pliny and Marcellus affirme) a Fox sod in water till nothing of the Foxe be left whole except the bones, The medi∣cines arising out of Foxes. and the Legges or other parts of a gouty body washed and daily bathed therein, it shall driue away all paine and griefe, strengthning the defectiue and weake members; so also it cureth all the shrinking vp and paines in the sinnewes: and Galen attributeth the same vertue to an Hyaena sod in Oyle, and the lame person bathed therein, for it hath such power to euacuate and draw forth whatsoeuer euill humour aboundeth in the body of man, Sextus that it leaueth nothing hurtfull behinde. Neuerthelesse, such bodies are soone againe replenished through euill dyet, and relap∣sed into the same disease againe. The Fox may be boyled in fresh or salt water with annise and time, and with his skin on whole and not slit, or else his head cut off, there being added to the decoction two pintes of oile. The flesh of a Foxe sod and layed to asore bitten by a Sea-hare, Mathaeolus it cureth and healeth the same. The Foxes skinne (as is already said) is profitable against all moyste fluxes in the skinne of the body, and also the gowt, and cold in the sinnewes. The ashes of Foxes flesh burnt and drunk in wine, is profitable against the shortnesse of breath and stoppings of the liuer. The blood of a Foxe dissected and taken forth of his vrine aliue, and so drunke, Albertus Siluuius brea∣keth the stone in the bladder, or else (as Myrepsus saieth) kill the Foxe, and take the blood and drinke a cupfull thereof, and afterward with the same wash the genitall parts, and with∣in an houre the stone shall be voyded: the same vertue is in it being dryed and drunke in wine with sugar. Oxycraton and Foxes blood infused into the Nostrils of a lethargicke Horsse, Absyrtus cureth him. The fat is next to a Buls and a Swines, so as the fat or larde of Swyne may be vsed for the fat of Foxes, and the fat of Foxes for the Swynes grease in medicine. Some do heere∣with annoynt the places which haue the Crampe, and all trembling and shaking mem∣bers. The fatte of a Foxe and a Drake inclosed in the belly of a Goose, and so rosted, with the dripping that commeth from it they annoynt paralyticke members. The same with powder of Vine twigs mollified and sod in lye, attenuateth and bring∣eth downe all swelling tumours in the flesh. Aetius. The fat alone healeth the Alopecias and loos∣nesse of the haire; it is commended in the cure of all sores and vlcers of the head, but the gall and fime with Mustard-seede is more approued. The fat is also respected for the cure of paine in the eares, if it be warmed and melt at the fire and so instilled; Hierocles Absyrtus Theomnestus and this is vsed against tingling in the eares. If the haires rot away on a Horsse taile, they recouer them againe by washing the place with vrine and branne, with Wine and Oyle, and afterward annoynt it with foxes grease. When sores or vlcers haue procured the haire to fall off from the heade, take the head of a younge foxe burned with the leaues of blacke Orcha∣nes and Alcyonium, and the powder cast vpon the head recouereth againe the haire. Aegineta. If the braine be often giuen to infants and sucking children, it maketh that they shall remaine free from the falling euill. Pliny prescribeth a man which twinkleth with his eies, and cannot looke stedfastly, to weare in a chaine the tongue of a foxe; and Marcellus biddeth to cut out the tongue of a liue foxe, and so turne him away, and hange vppe that tongue to dry in purple thred, and afterward put it about his necke that is troubled with the whitenesse of the eies, and it shall cure him. But it is more certainely affirmed, that the tongue either dryed or greene, layed to the flesh wherein is any Dart or other sharpe head, it draweth them forth violently, Discorides and renteth not the flesh, but onely where it is entred. The liuer dryed and drunke cureth of∣ten sighing, the same or the lights drunke in blacke Wine, openeth the passages of brea∣thing. The same washed in Wyne and dryed in an earthen pot in an Ouen, and afterward seasoned with Sugar, is the best medicine in the world for an old cough, for it hath bin ap∣proued to cure it, although it hath continued twenty yeares, drinking euery day two spon∣fuls in Wine. The lightes of foxes drunke in Wate they haue been dryed into powder, Pliny. help∣peth the Melt, and Myrepsus affirmeth, that when he gaue the same powder to one almost suffocated in a pleurisie, it preuailed for a remedy. Archigene prescribeth the dried liuer of a Fox for the Spleneticke with Oxymell: and Marcellinus for the Melt, drunke after the same manner; Sextus and Sextus aduiseth to drinke it simply without composition of Oxymell. The gall of a Foxe instilled into the eares with Oyle, cureth the paine in them, and mixed with Hony Atticke and annointed vpon the eies, taketh away al dimnes from them, after an admirable manner. The melt bound vpon the tumors and bunches of the brest, cureth the Melt in mans body. The reynes dried and mingled with Honie, being anointed vp∣on kernels, take them away. For the swelling of the chaps, rub the reines of a Fox with∣in the mouth. The genitals because of their gristly and bony substance, are approued for the dispersing of the stone in the bladder. The stones take away pimples and spots in the face. The dung pounded with Vineger, by anointment cureth the Leprosie speedily. These and such other vertues medicinal both the elder and later Phisitians haue obserued in a Fox, wherewithal we wil conclude this dis∣course; sauing that many writers haue deuisd diuers witty inuentions and fables of Foxes, vnder them to expresse vices of the world, as when they set a Foxe in a Friers weed, prea∣ching to a sort of Hens and Geese, following the fixion of Archilochus Fox, to signifie how irreligious pastors in holy habittes beguile the simple with subtilty. Also of a Foxe tea∣ching a Hare to say his Credo or Creed betwixt his legs, and for this cause almightie God in his word compareth false prophets to Foxes Ezek. 13. destroying the young Grapes and plants. The Weasill brought a Fox into a garner of corne through a small hole, and when he had filled his belly, he assayed to come out againe at the same place, but in vaine, because his body swelled with ouer eating, and therefore hee was constrained to come out as emptie and hungry as he came in: whereuppon this conference was made betwxit them: Forte per angustam tenuis Voulpecula rimam, Repserat in cameram frumenti, postaque rursus. Ire for as pleno tendebat corpore frustra. Cui mustela procul, si vis ait, effugere isthinc Macra cauum repetes arctum, quem macra subisti. OF THE GENNET-KAT, called Genetha. T His beast is called Genitocatus, either for the similitude it holdeth with a cat, or else because it hath beene beleeued that it was engendered by a cat, but I rather do assent that the right name thereof is Ginetta or Ginetha, because they are bred in Spaine with the Ginnet horsses, and so taketh his name from the place. Albertus (though a learned man yet many times he was deceiued in the names of beastes,) called this creature Genocha, and the Germaines call it ei Gennithkatz. The quantity or stature heereof is greater then a cat, Albertus but lesser then a Foxe, and therefore I thinke it about the mold or bignes of a young Fox of six moneths old. It is a meek and gentle crea∣ture, except it be prouoked, for in Constantinople they are kept tame, and are suffered to goe vp and downe from house to house like cats; being wilde they loue the valleyes and lowe places, ellonius. especially the marishes or land neere the waters, for the steepe rocky moun∣taines they cannot endure. Isidorus. And these Cardan taketh for to be of the Weasill kind, because the forme and disposition thereof, especially to the tame and Domesticall Weasill, and in Spaine they are cald Foinai, Ʋincentius linac. being blacke and ash-coloured distinguished and variably, interlined with many spots. But Scaliger who was delighted to contradict Ierom Cardan, cannot endure to heare of this comparison, betwixt Weasils and Ginnet-cats, because he saith, the skin of a Gennit∣ta is bigger then 3. Wea∣sils, and that it resembleth a Weasill in nothing ex∣cept in the eares: but Gar∣dans cōparison toucheth not the quantity but one∣ly the outward forme and qualities, and he himselfe disagreeth not that it is e∣qual in quantity to an Ot∣ter. But certainly the skin thereof is admirable and beautiful to behold, and if they were not common, but rare and sildom found beastes, it is no question but the price thereof and due estimation would ex∣cell many others: For the abundance of spots, their naturall and vniforme or∣der, their shining splen∣dor and brightnesse, giue place to no other party co¦loured beast, as you may obserue in the true figure thereof here declared. Of the skinne. In the next place I haue also thought good to expresse the figure of the skin taken off which skinne, from the heade to the toppe of the taile was about foure spannes and one palme long, and the taile was as long as the body being seuered from the skinne: the la∣titude or bredth thereof in the middle, was about one spanne in bredth, the middle of the belly and the vpper part of the necke, were ash coloured, and in the taile were eight black circles and so many white, one successiuely following the other; the whole body aspersed with blacke spots, Oppianus and the residue yellowish white. The skinne smelt sweetly and somewhat like to a Mosk-cat, and from Lyons in France, they are brought into Germany, three or foure of them being sold for a Noble. It is very probable that it is a little kind of Panther or Leopard, for there is a little Panther which hath such spots, and besides of such a stature and harmeles disposition, whose skin in olde time was pretiously vsed for Garments, and the sauor thereof was very pleasant, and ther∣fore I superseed any further discourse heereof, till we come to the declaration of the grea∣ter beast. OF THE GOAT Male and Female. The seueral names. T He male or great Goat-Bucke, is called in Haebrew Atud, and the lesser Seir, and Zeir. The Chaldee translateth it Gen, 13. Teias-i ij and Numb. 15, Ize, the Arabians Te∣us and Maez : the Persians Asteban and Busan ; the Graeci∣an, Tragos, of deuouring or rauening in meat, according to the verse: Tragus ab Edendo quod grana fracta pane. Also Chimaron and Enarchan : the Latines Hircus, and som∣time Caper, which word properly signifieth a gelded-goat, as Martiall vseth it in this verse: Dum iugulas hircum factus es ipse Caper. The Italians Beccho, the Germaines Bock, and for distinction sake, Geissbocke, and Reech¦bock ; and Booeck, the Spaniards Cabron, the French Bouc, the Illyrians Kozell. The reason of the Latine word Hircus, is deriued of Hirtus (signifying rough) by rea∣son of the roughnes of their bodies. And it is further to be vnderstoode that the generall kind of goats (which the Latines distinguish by Hircus, Capra, and Hoedus ) that is, by their sex, or by their age: the Haebrewes cal them singularly Ez, and plurally Izim, Numb. 15 for a goat of a yeare old, you shall read Izbethsch neth. The Chaldee vseth also the general word Oza, the Arabian Schaah, the Persian Buz, and whereas Leuit, 16, Seir is put for Ca∣per a gelded goate, there the Chaldee rendereth it Zephirah, the Arabians Atud, and the Persian Buzgalaie. And in the same chapter you shal read Azazel, which Dauid Kimhi ren∣dereth for the name of a mountaine nere Sinai, where goats vse to feede and lodge: and the Septuagints translate it Apopompaion, signifying emission or sending away, and for this cause I suppose, that when the scape-goa was by the priest sent out of the Temple, hee went to that mountaine, and therefore the word Azazel seemeth to be compounded of Ez, a goat, & Azal Iuit, that is, he went; for the scape-goat went & carried away the euil. The Graecians cal the female goat Aix, which seemeth to be deriued of Ez the Haebrew word. The Arabians Dakh and Metaham, as I find in Autcen, the Saracens An se, the Itali∣ans, Artumnus. Peccho, changing, B. from the male into P. and the Spaniards Capron, the French Che∣ure or Chieure, the Germaines Geiss, the Illyrians Koza, and the Tuscanes at this day call a female goat ( Zebei. ) And this may suffice for the names of both male and female. Their nature is to be declared seuerally, except in those thinges wherein they agree without difference, and first of all: the male is rightly termed Dux & maritus Caprarum the guide and husband of the females, and therefore Virgill saith of him not improperly, Vir gregis ipse Caper. The hee goat is the husband of the flock: and except in his genitals and horns he differeth not in any proportion or substance from the female. His hornes are longer and stronger then are the females, Their seue∣rall partt. and therefore vpon prouocation he striketh through an ordinary peece of armor or shield at one blow: his force and the sharpenes of his hornes are so preg able. He hath many attributes among the learned, as left-sided, a∣ged, The epithets of Goats. greedy, bearded, swift, long legged, horne-bearer, captaine of the flocke, heauy, rough, hoarse-voiced, rugged, vnarmed, vncleane, strong-smelling, lecherous, bristle , wanderer, vile, wanton, sharpe, stinking, two-horned, and such like: whereby his nature and qualities are so deciphered as it needeth no long treatise of explication. There is no beast that is more prone and giuen to lust then is a Goate, The veneri∣ous dispositi∣on of Goats. for he ioyneth in copulation before all other beastes. Seuen daies after it is yeaned and kiddened, it be∣ginneth and yealdeth seede, although without proofe. And seuen monthes old it engen∣dereth to procreation, and for this cause that it beginneth so soone, it endeth at 5. yeares, Aelianus and after that time is reckoned vnable to accomplish that worke of nature. When the E∣gyptians wil describe fecundity or ability of generation, they do it by picturing of a male Goate. That which is most strange and horrible among other beastes is ordinary and common among these, for in them scarce the Brother ioyneth with the Sister, and a Camell can neuer he brought to couer his dam: but among these the young ones being males, Columella couer their mothers, euen while they sucke hir milke. If they be fat, they are lesse venerous then being macilent or leane. Herodotus declareth that in his time a Goat of Mendesia in Egypt, had carnal copulation with a woman in the open sight of men, and afterward was led about to be seene. When they desire copulation they haue a proper voyce wherewithall (as it seemeth) they prouoke the female to loue. This is called in Italy Biccari, & Biccarie, which the Venetians apply to al lecherous companions as commonly as a prouerb, and this they neuer vse but at that time. By reason of his lust his eies sink deepe into the corners of their holes (called Eirqui ) and Apuleius with other Grammarians do deriue the word Hircus wher∣by this beast is called, from that disposition. By drinking salt water they are made desirous and apt to procreation. At that time they fight mutually one with another for their females, and it is a terme among the late writers, to call those men Hirci -Goats which are contented to permit other men to lye with their Wiues in publique, before their owne faces for gaine, Coelius because they imagine that such is the property of Goates. But I know not with what reason they are moued heereunto, for there is a memorable story to the contrary. In Sibaris there was a young manne called Crathis, which being not able to retaine lust, but forsaken of God and giuen ouer to a reprobate sence, A memorable story of the punishment of buggery. committed buggery with a female Goate, the which thing the maister Goate beheld and looked vpon, and dissem∣bled, concealing his mind and iealousie for the pollution of his female. Afterward finding the said young man a sleepe, (for he was a shepherd) he made all his force vpon him, and with his hornes dashed out the buggerers braines. The man being founde dead on this manner, and the Goat which he had rauished deliuered of a monster, hauing a mans face and a Goates legs, they called it Siluanus, and placed it in the rank of idoll Gods, but the wretched man himselfe was buried with more honor then beseemed, for they gaue him a Noble funerall, and finding a riuer in Achaia which mingled water with another, they cal∣led it Crathis, after the name of that vnnatural and beastly monster; wherupon also came the Italian Crathis which Strabo remembreth. By which story it is euident, that iealous riuality resteth as wel in Goats as in men of more reasonable capacity and vnderstanding. Coelius. Strabo The females desire of copulation is no lesse then the males, for while they suck they ad∣mit the male, and at the seuenth month they conceiue. The best time of their admission to procreation is about the end of Autumne (according to Columella his opinion. The lust of the females and their co∣pulation. ) They are not filled the first day of copulation, but the second, or third, and those which are ioyned in Nouember doe bring forth their young in the spring when all thinges grow fresh and greene: wherefore if they chance to be slack, and not willing to engender or couple, Meanes to stir vp the goats to co∣pulation. their keepers vse this sleight or pollicy, to procure and stir vp their lust. They rub their vdders with Nettles vntil they constrain blood, & afterward with a handful of salt and nitre, or else with pepper or Myrrhe; after which rubbing, their desire of copulation much increaseth, and it maketh the female to prouoke the male and vndergo him more willingly; Aelianus. and this thing also procureth in them aboundance of milke (as Aristotle affirmeth) he had seene tryed by making experiment thereof vpon the brests of Women, virgins, and widdowes: And generally all the keepers of Cattell doe heerewith rubbe their genitals, for the furthering and prouoking in them carnall copulation, with the things aforesaid. They being filled and with young, Florent uus The time of their going with young. they carry them in their belly fiue monthes before deliuerance. After three yeares olde the female ceaseth to retaine in her selfe or confer to her Kids the strength of nature, and the male after foure, so that it is not a part of good husbandry to keepe their young which they bring forth after those years, but rather to kill them and make them away; So also it is not good to keepe their firstinges, The multipli¦cation of young Kids. or those which are first of all engendered, but rather the second or 3. seed of procreation. Some of them bring forth twins, and some more, as it is reported of the Goates of Egypt, which bring forth fiue at a time, because they drinke of the fruitfull riuer of Nilus : for the Goat-heards of the country do giue thereof to their cattle, and fetch it into all parts of that region, Aelianus. and in Illeria they breed twice a yeare, bringing forth sometime three, foure, or fiue at once, Aristotle but 3. at a time are neuer to be kept, but killed & eaten, for they are accounted not worth their bringing vp; onely cold maketh them to suffer abortementes, Aristotle and sometimes they bring forth monsters like to other cattle (for al little beasts are more apt to engender mon∣sters then the greater.) Concerning the time that they beare yong, it is in Italy 8. years, The time of their young bearing. and being fat they are not apt to conceiue, wherefore they make them leane before they admit them to their bucks. One male is sufficient for ten femals, and som (saith Varro ) prouide but one for 15. (as Menas, ) and other but one for 20. (as Murus. ) Ther is no creatur that smelleth so strong¦ly as doth a male Goat, by reason of his immoderate lust, The strong smell or a∣uor of a goat. In Mercat. and in imitation of them the la∣tines call men which haue strong breaths ( Hircosi ) Coatish: whereupon Plautus saiteh to an old lecherous fellow which could not keepe his lips from slauering of women, Cum sis iam aetatis plenus, anima foetida Senex hircole tu osculere mulierem. And therefore Tiberius Caesar who was such a filthy and greasie-smelling old man, was cal∣led ( Hircus Vetolus ) an olde Goate, in the Atellanican comaedie. They coniecture of men that haue hairy legs to be vnchast and full of lust, by reason of their similitude with a goat, and those which haue shril and clamorous voice, the Grecians cal ( Margoi ) that is (Block-heads.) Those which haue eies like to goats they call Aegopoi Goat-eies, Plutarch. that is very red eies. The Egyptians affirm that their femal goats when Sirius the star in the beginning of dog-daies riseth with the sun, do continually looke vpon the east, and that their attentiue obseruation is a most certaine argument of the reuolution, A secret in female goats. that is the appearance and de∣parture of the said dog-daies. The like things do the Libians report of their Goates con∣cerning that star, and moreouer that they foresee and foreshew chaunge of weather, Aelianus for they depart from their stables, and run wantonly abroad before showers, and afterwarde hauing well fed of their owne accord returne to their folds againe. Concerning the description of their seuerall parts, The descrip∣on of goates and th ir best properties. it is good to follow the direction of Cossinius, first to looke to their age (as is before said) if men desire to prouide Goates for heard-breed and profit, so as their Kids may be like them, and they beare young or conti∣nue procreation eight yeare at the least. And for their outward parts, let them be firme, great, well compacted, full of muscles, and the superficies of their whole body be soft and equall, without bunches or indentures: therefore a thicke haire, Lorentius two dugges hanging vn∣der their snout or chin, are good signes of the best Goats. There are two kinds of Goates, one horned, & of this sort the long-sharp-horned, beasts, The seuerall kinds of got Albertus. with broad foreheades, are the most approued, and by the circles of their hornes their age is discerned: But the vnhorned are best for breed, procreation, and milke, and such are the Caspian Goats, which are for the most part white, flat nosed, and little of growth. Their eies are very deepe in their heads, and therefore their sight sharp, strong, and con∣tinuall seeing bright and cleare in the night, but the colour of their eyes variable, Aelianus Pliny. like to the colour of their bodyes; The males haue moe teeth then the females, for the females want their vpper teeth: But males and femals haue large beards vnder their chins, & this is called Aruncus, (saith Eryngus ) but the reasow heereof is, because that when a Goat is ta∣ken by the beard and drawne out of the fold, all the residue stand amazed, and so also when any of them hath eatan Sea-holly (cald Eryngium :) so that Aristotle confoundeth Eryngi∣um for Aruncum and so taketh one for another. Once in Lemnos there was a Male-goate which had so much milk wrung out of his papes growing betwixt his legs, that therewith a Calfe by licking it receiued the beestings, but afterward the male Kid begotten by the same Goate had the like vdders, whereat the owner being much amazed, because it was a prodigious thing, for his satisfaction asked counsell at the Oracle, from whom he recei∣ued this answer, that it betokened nothing but plentifull encrease of his cattle. The fe∣males haue two vdders vnder their loines next to the smal of their belly, Orthagorus Aristotle except the Libian Goates and their vdders lye vnder their breast or forepart of their belly, like an Apes. In Naxus the Goates haue greater gals then in any other part of the world, and the forepart is held prodigious: Naxvs Aelianus on the contrary; in Chalcis the Goates haue no gall at all. They haue many bellies and a round melt which thing no other horned-beast hath except a sheepe. The males haue harsher haires then their females, Of the Cilici¦ā cloth made of goats hair. and the Libian Goates haue haire as long as womens, and very rough curled, which the inhabitants sheare of euery year, and therewith the ship-wrights make gable ropes: but in Cilicia and Phrygia, they sheare them and make the stuffe called Zambelot: and another kind of cloth called Mathaliaze. Bellnu. In Ara∣bia they make tents of cloth compiled of Asses and goates haire, and it seemeth that Cili∣cia receiued his name of this kind of cloth, which is called in Latine Cilicium, or else that this cloth was first inuented among them, wherevpon it receiued that denomination; but among the Grammarians and Poets, Lana Caprina, (Goates wooll) grew to a prouerbe, to signifie a thing of no weight or moment, as it is in Horace : Alter rixatur de lana saepe caprina propugnat nugis armatus. There are another sort of Goates which are called Syrian Goates, and of some Mambrin Goates, and most commonly Indian Goates; because they are most noble in that coun∣try, and that in Coytha ; and likewise in the Region of Damiata, Of the Mem∣brin or Syri∣an goates. for Mambre is a Mountaine neere Hebron, from whence it is probable, that the word Mambrin commeth; wherefore I haue thought good to expresse the figure both of the greatest of that kind, as it was taken by Antonius Musa Brasaualus, Physitian to the Noble Duke Hercules de este, at Ferraria, by one of these Goates brought thither to be seene. T Hese lesser were found pictured in an old ma∣nuscript in Germany, which booke did in∣treate of the holy land. The greater Goate I coniecture to be the same which Leo Afer calleth Adi∣main, and is founde in Mauritania, being as tall as an Asse, and hath very long broad eares pendant, and vnder them next to their neckes two thinges like dugges or pappes, which hange downe from their throate, and these are most fruitefull in milke, and with these the Libians plowe, and keepe them in stead of Kie and other Cattle, for they milke them, and of their milke make Butter and Cheese; their haire is very short, & they very gentle and familiar, so that the saide Leo affirmeth, that when he was a young man, and loued those rash and wanton sports wherewithall youth are delighted, hee gotte vp vpon one of these, and rode quietly vpon the back of it aboue a quarter of a mile. They keepe being wilde in the deserts of Lybia, and if at time they stray or wander into Nymidia, and the fieldes thereof, it is accounted by the people and inhabitauntes, a prodigious and monstrous thing. The lesser kind I coniecture to be the right Mambrine or Syrian Goat, although some of the late writers call it an Indian Goat, the reason is, because (as hath been said) they cal al strange beasts by the names of Indians, if they find them not in their owne countrey. The eares of it are large and broad, as the picture describeth, and such eares haue the Goates of Gallia-Narbon, being at the least as broade as a mans spanne, they are of colour like wilde-Goates, their hornes verye sharpe, and standing not farre distant one from the other, and haue stones like a stone horse, being in al other parts not vnlike to the vulgar and common Goat. Albertus. How Goates ke breath, Varro Some curious heardsmen (as Alcmaeon and Archelaus ) haue deliuered to the world, that goats take breath thorough their eares, and Phyles approueth their concept, because hee had scene an experiment of a Goat, that his mouth and nostrilles being stopped fast, neuer∣thelesse he seemed not to be troubled for want of breath: and for this also is alleadged the authority of Oppianus, who writeth of certaine wilde goats called ( Aegari, ) that they haue a certaine hole or passage in the middle of their heade, betwixt the hornes, which goeth di∣rectly vnto the liuer, and the same stopped with liquid Waxe, suffocateth or stifleth the beast. If this be true (as I woulde not any way extenuate the authority of the writer) then it is very likely that some haue (without difference) attributed to all kinds of Goats that which was propper to this kinde alone, for the former opinion is not reasonable: Neuerthelesse leaue euery man to his owne liberty of beleeuing or refusing. The quicke sence of hea∣ ing. There is no beast that heareth so perfectly and so sure as a Goat, for he is not only holp in this sence with his eares, but also hath the organ of hearing in part of his throate, where∣fore when the Egyptians describe a man which hath an excellent eare, they expresse him by a goat. . Mind. There are some kind of goates in Illyria which haue whole hooues like a horse, and these are onely founde in that Region: In all other Nations of the worlde, they are clouen-footed. The vse of ir seuerall . The vse of their seueral parts is singular, and firste of al to beginne with their skinne, the people of Sardinia (as saith Nymphiderus ) nourish goates for their skinnes, whereof they make garments, being dressed with the haire vpon them, and they affirme strange vir∣tue in them▪ namely that they heat their bodies in the Winter, and coole them in the sum∣mer, and the haires growing vppon those skinnes are a cubit long, therefore the man that weareth them in Winter time, turneth the hary side next to his bodie, and so is warmed by it: and in Summer, the raw side, and so the haire keepeth the sunne from piercing his skin and violence of heat: And this also is vsuall in Sueuia, where the women weare garments of Goats haire in the winter, and also make their childrens coats thereof, according to Virgils saying in Moreto, Suida . Ʋar us Et cinctus villosae tegmine Caprae. For this cause the Merchants buy them rough in those parts of Sauoy neer Geneua, and their choyse is, of the young ones which die naturally, or are kild, or els such as were not aboue 2. years old. The Tirians in the Persian war, wore vpon their backes goat-skins. In auncient time they made hereof Diphtera, that was a kind of parchment, wheron they wrote on both sides, . and had the name in Greeke from that vse: which Hermolaus by a metaphorical allu∣sion, (called Opistographi. ) From the vse of these in garments, came the apellation of harlots to be cald Pellices, and a whores bag was called Penula-Scortea, such a one is vsed by pilgrims which go to visit the church of Saint Iames of Calec, and such Carriers or foote-poastes had wont to vse in their iournies, which caused Martiall to write thus: Ingrediare viam coelo licet vs{que} sereno An subitas nusquam scortea depit aquas. The Sandals which men were wont to weare on their feete in the East Countries, were also made of Goats skins, and there was a custome in Athens, that men for honour of Bac∣chus, did dance vpon certain bottels made of Goats skins, and ful of wind, the which were placed in the middest of the Theatre, and the dauncer was to vse but one Leg, to the in∣tent that he might often fall from the slippery bottels, and make the people sport; where∣vnto Virgill alluded this saying: Plinyus Mollibus in pratis vnctos saliere pro vtres. There is also a Ladanum tree in Carmania, by the cutting of the barke whereof there yssu∣eth forth a certaine gumme, which they take and preserue in a Goats skin; their vse in war wherein the Souldiers were wont to lie all winter, and therefore we read that Claudius the Emperour had giuen him thirty tents of Goats skinnes for his Souldiers attendant vpon the iudges: and the Marriners also by these defended themselues from the violence of stormes vpon the sea: and so I leaue this part of the beast with remembrance of that which is written in holy scripture Heb. 11. that the people of God in ancient times did fly away from the rage of persecution, being apparelled or rather meanely disguised in goat skins, being charitably holped by the beastes, that were cruelly put to death by wretched men. In the next place the milke of Goats commeth to be considered for that also hath bin, is, and wil be of great account for Butter and Cheese, which the writers call Tyropoeia, The milke of Goates. and Virgill celebrateth the singular commendation both of the Woll and of the milke in these verses; Haec quoque non cura nobis leuiore tuenda Nec minor vsus erit quamuis Milesia magno Vellera mutentur Tyrios incocta rubores Deusior hinc soboles hinc largi copia lactis Quo magis exhausto spumauerit vbere mulctra Laeta magis pressis manabunt flumina manonis Nec minus interca barbas, incanaque menta Cyniphij tondent hirei setasque comantes Vsus in Castrorum: & miseris velamina nautis. Therfore their milk is profitable for Butter, although inferior to a Cows, yet equall to a sheepes, and the heardsmen giue their goats salt before they be deliuered of their young, To increase Goats milke Albertus for this maketh them abound in milke Others with Goats milke preserue their Wine from corruption by sowrenes; first they put into their wine the twentyeth part so much as is of the Wine, and so let it stand in the same vessell couered three or foure daies, A secret in the milke of Goates. Myrepsus after∣ward they turne it into a sweet and fresh vessell, and so it remaineth preserued from all an∣noyance of sourenesse. Cheeses made of Goats milke were wont to be called Velabrenses Casei, because among the Romans they were made at Velabrum, and that with smoke, whereupon Martial made this Distichon ; Non quemcunque focum nec fumum caseus omnem Sed velabrensem qui bibit: ipse sapit. Aristotle and Iulius Pollux doe commend the Sicilian Cheese, which was made of sheepe and Goats milke together, and by Athaeneus it is called ( Caseus Tromilicus ) and by Simoni∣des Stromilius. In Rhaetia of Heluetia there are excellent Cheeses made of Goates milke and cow-mile mixed together. The milke also of a Goat mixed to a womans milke is best for the nourishment of man, because it is not too fat, Hermolaus yet Galen saith if it be eaten without Hony, water, and salt, it curdleth in the belly of a man like a cheese and strangleth him; and being so vsed it purgeth the belly: from thence came the fiction of the Poets, that Iupiter was noursed by a Goate, and that afterward in his warre against the Titanes or Giants, he slew that Goate by the counsell of Themis and wore her skin for an armour, and so hauing, obtained victory placed the Goate among the stars, wherupon she was called Aixourania, a heauenly Goate, and so Germanicus Caesar made this verse vpon him, and Iupiter him∣selfe was called Agiochus: —Illa putatur Agio hus. Nutrix esse Iouis si vere Iupiter infans Vbera Cretae mulssit fidissima Caprae Sydere quae claro gratum testatur alumnum The flesh of male Goats is not wholsome for mans body, but the flesh of a female in the spring and fall of the leafe, Of the flesh of Goats. by reason of the good nourishment may be eaten without dan∣ger. They are worse then bul-beefe, because they are sharper in concoction and hotter, wherefore if they disgest not well, they increase melancholy. The liuer of a Goat being eaten, doth bring the falling sicknesse, yet being salted a good space, and then sodde with Vine braunches or other such broad leaues, to keepe them asunder, and some wine pou∣red into the water when they are almost sod, they become very sweet and delicate meate; and therefore the Athenians praised the Lacedemonians, that in their feast which they cal∣led Copidae, they slew a Goat; and held it for a deuine meat. Also Clitomachus an Academicke of Carthage, relateth of a certaine Thebane Champion, which excelled in strength all the Champions of his time, and that he did eat continually Goats flesh, for it is very strong and remaineth a long season in the body, & doth much good being disgested, notwithstanding the strong and ranke smell thereof, otherwise it is dangerous as is already said, therefore Fiera hauing commended the Kydd, when hee commeth to speake of the Goat, he writeth thus: Cum male olet siccat, fit iam caper improbus, absit Et Cadat ante focos victima Bacche tuos. But Pliny affirmeth, that if a male Goat eate Barley-bread or Parsneps washed, the same day that he is killed, then there is no poison in his flesh: the stones of a Bucke-goat, resist concoction, and beget euil humors in the body: wherefore such a banket is cald in Greek ( Tragos Hulibertas ) for Goats after their copulation, Aegineta. haue an euil flesh, not fat, but dry, and the remedy to make their flesh sweeter, is to geld the male when he is young and ten∣der, Albertus. for so his temperature is amended by a cold and moist constitution. The inhabitants of Portugall eat Goats flesh, and account it delicate meat; especially such as dwell in the mountaines. In Germany they make of it a kind of meat which is cal∣led Klobvvsst, and is prepared on this manner: they take a Goats Hart newly taken out of his bodie, Textor. and slit it into small peeces, and break six Egs vpon it, and the crums of white bread, seasoned with spices and Saffron, and so put into a bagge, and sod or roasted: af∣terward they are serued vpon the table, and strewed ouer with kitchen suger. The guts being salted are called ( Hilla ) which the French stuffe like pudinges, and call them ( Saulcisses ) from whence commeth our English sawsadge; of this sewet and fatte of Goats are the best candles made, because it is hard and not ouer liquyd. The bloode of a Goat hath an vnspeakable propertie, for it scoureth rustie yron better then a file, it also softneth an Adamant stone, Pliny. Hermolaus. Pausanius and that which no fire is able to melt; nor yron to break, be∣ing of such an inuincible nature, that it contemneth al violent things, yet is it dissolued by the warme blood of a Goat. The Load-stone draweth iron, and the same being rubbed with garlicke, dieth and looseth that propertie, but being dipped againe in goats blood, reuiueth and recouereth the former nature. Osthanes, prescribeth for a remedy of loue, the vrine of a Goate to be mingled with Spicknard, and so drunk by him which is ouercome with that passion, assuring him there∣by that they shall fal in as great lothing as euer before they wer in louing. With the hoofs of a Goat they driue away Serpentes, and also with the haires by burning and perfuming them in the place where the Serpents lodge. Pallagdius. With the hornes of goats they make Bowes, for in Delos there was dedicated the horn of a Goat, which was two cubits long and a span▪ and heereat ought no man to wonder, Archa hines. for that noble bow of Pandarus which Homer com∣mendeth, was made of a horne of a female Goat. Affricanus declareth, that in auncient time they made fruitful their Vine-yards by this meanes: Varinus they tooke three hornes of a female goat, and buried them in the earth with their points or tops downeward, to the root of the Vine stocks, leauing the hollow tops, stan∣ding a little out of the ground, and so when the raine descended, it filled the hornes, and soked to the roote of the Vine, perswading themselues thereby that they receiued no small aduantage in their Grapes. The gaul of a Female-goat put into a vessel and set in the carth, is said by Albertus to haue a naturall power in it to draw Goates vnto it, as though they receiued great commodity thereby. Likewise, if you would haue white haires to grow in any part of a Horse; shaue off the haire and annoint the place with the gall of a Goat, so shall you haue your desire. The Sabcans, by reason of the continuall vse of Mir∣rhe and Frankinsens, grow to a loathing of that sauour: for remedy of which anoyance, they perfume their houses by burning stirackes in goats skins. And thus much for the se∣uerall parts of a goat. There were in ancient time three kindes of Heards-men which receiued dignity one aboue another; the first were called ( Bucollici ) Neat-heards, because they keepe the grea∣ter Cattell: the second were ( Opiliones ) Shepheards, of their attendaunce vpon sheepe: the third, last, and lowest kind, were termed, Aepoli and Caprarij, that is (Goat-heards) or keepers of Goates, and such were the Locrentians, who were called Ozolae, because of theyr filthy smell, for they had the most parte of their conuersation amonge other beastes. A Goate-heard or keeper of these cattle must be a sharpe stearne, harde; laborious, patient, bold and chearefull, and such a one as can easily run ouer the rocks through the Wildernesse, and among the bushes without feare or griefe, so that he must not follow his flocke like other heards, but goe before them: they must also be light and nimble, to follow the wandering goats, that runne awaie from their fellowes, and so bring them back againe, for Goates are nimble, mooueable, and inconstant, and therefore apt to depart awaie, except they be restrained by the heard and his Dogge. Neither haue Goates a Captaine or Bell-bearer like vnto sheepe, whom they follow, but euery one is directed after his owne will, and heerein appeareth the pride of this beast, that he scorneth to come behind either catell or sheepe, but alwaies goeth before; and also in their owne heardes among themselues, the Bucke goeth before the Female, for the reuerence of his beard (as Aelianus saith) the labor of the goat-heard must be to see his cattel well fed abroad in the day time, and well foulded at night, the first rule therefore in this husbandry is to deuide the flockes, and not to put any great number of them together, for heerein they differ from sheep, who loue to liue together in multitudes, as it were affecting society by which they thriue better, and mourne not so much as when they are alone: but goats loue singu∣larity, and may well be called Schismatiks among Cattell, and therefore they thriue best lying together in small numbers, otherwise, in great flockes they are soone infected with the pestilence, and therefore in France, they care not to haue Magnos Gregos sed plures: not great flocks, but many. The number of their flocke ought not to exceede fifty, whereupon Varro writeth this story of Gabinus a Roman Knight, who had a field vnder the suburbes containing a thou∣sand Akers of pasture ground, who seeing a poore goat-heard bring his goats euery day to the citty, and receiued for their milke a peny a peece, he being led with couetousnesse, proponed to himselfe this gaine, that if he stored his said fielde with a thousand Milch-fe∣male-goates, he also should receiue for their milke a thousand pence a day; whereupon he added action to his intent, and filled his fielde with a thousand goates, but the euent fell out otherwaies then he expected: for in short time the multitude infected one another, and so he lost both milke and flesh, whereby it is apparant, that it is not safe to feed great flocks of these cattell together. In Indian, in the Region Coitha, the inhabitants giue their milch-goates dried fishes to eate, but their ordinary foode is leaues, tender braunches, and boughes of trees, and also bushes or brambles; whereupon Virgill wrot in this mauner: Pascuntur vero siluas & summa Lycaei morentesque rubos & amantes arctua dumos. They loue to feede on the Mountaines better then in the vallies and greene fieldes; al∣waies striuing to licke vp the yuie or green plants, or to climbe vpon trees, cropping off with their teeth all maner wild herbs, and if they be restrained and inclosed in fields, then they doe the like to the plants that they find there, wherefore there was an auncient law a∣mong the Romans, when a man let out his ground to farme he should alwaies condition and except with the farmer that he should not breede any Goate in his ground, for their teeth are enemies to all tender plantes: their teeth are also exitiable to a tree, and Pliny and Varro affirme, that the Goate by licking the Oliue tree maketh it barren; for which cause in ancient time, A Goate was not sacrifized to Minerua to whom the Olyue was sa∣cred. There is no creature that feedeth vpon such diuersity of meat as Goats, for which cause they are elegantly brought in by Eupolis the olde Poet, bragging of theyr belly cheare, wherein they number vp aboue fiue and twenty seueral things, different in name, nature, and tast: and for this cause, Eustathius defended by strong argument against Disarius, that men and cattell which feede vpon diuers things, haue lesse health then those beasts which eate one kind of fruite alone. They loue Tameriske, Alderne, Elme-tree, assarabacke, and a tree called Alaternus, which neuer beareth fruit but only leaues: also three leaued-grasse, yuie, the hearbe Lada, which groweth no where but in Arabia, whereby it commeth to passe, that many times the haire of Goats is found in the gumbe called Ladanum, for the peoples greedy desire of the gumbe, causeth them to wipe the iuyce from the Goates beard. For the increase of milke in them, giue them Cinquefoyle fiue daies together before they drinke, or else binde Dittany to their bellies, or (as Lacuna translateth the words out of Affric nus ) you may lay milke to their bellies, belike by rubbing it thereupon. The wild Goats of Creete, Aristotle. eate dittany aforesaid against the stroks of Darts: and Serapion auoucheth by the experience of Galen, that goats by licking the leaues of Tamariske, loose their gall, and likewise that he saw them licking Serpents which had newly lost their skins, and the e∣uent therof was, that their age neuer turned or changed into whitenesse or other externall signes thereof. Also it is deliuered by good obseruation that if they eate or drinke out of vessels of Ta∣mariske, Constantinus they shal neuer haue any Spleen; if any one of them eate Sea-holly, the residue of the flocke stand still and will not goe orward, till the meate be out of his mouth. The Grammarians say that Chim ra was killed by Bellerophon the son of Glaucus in the Mountain Lycius, Aelianus. and the reason heereof is, that the Poets fained Chimaera to bee composed of a Lyon, a Dragon, and a Goate, and in that mountaine all those three were kept and fed: for in the top were Lions, in the middle were Goats, and also at the foot thereof Serpents. If they suffer heate or cold they are much endaungered, for such is their nature that they auoide all extremity, and the females with younge are most of al molested with cold. If they haue conceiued in the Wynter then many abortementes or casting their young fol∣loweth. In like sort it hapneth if they eate Walnuts (and not to their full) vnripe, therefore ei∣ther they must be suffered to eate of them to saciety, or else they are not to be permitted to them. Dioscorides If at any time they eate Scammony, Hellebore, Lesseron, or Mercury, they are much troubled in their stomach, and loose their milke, especially the white Hellebor. The publi∣cans in the prouince of Cyrene haue all the gouernment of the pastures, Pliny. and therfore they permit not Benzwine to grow in their country finding thereby greate gaine; and if at a∣ny time their sheepe or goats meete with any braunch thereof, they eate it geedily, but the sheepe immediatly fall to sleepe and the goates to Neezing. Agolethros and Sabine are poyson to Goates. The Herbe called in Greeke Rhododendron, and may be english∣ed Rose-tree, is poyson goates, and yet the same helpeth a man against the vemon of Serpents. The prickle or spindle tree (called also Euonimus ) which groweth in the Mount Occy∣nius (cal ed Ordyno ) about the bignesse of a pine-apple-tree, hauing soft leaues like the same, and it budde h in September, and the flower is like to a white violet flower, this kil∣leth Goates, except they be purged with black Hellebor imediately after they haue eaten thereof. Horus The Egyptians when they wil describe a man deuouring sheepe or Goats, they picture the herbe Curilago or Conyza, because it also killeth them. Also as Clodrysippus af∣firmeth they auoide Cumin, for it maketh them mad or bringeth vpon them lethargies, and such like infirmities. He auoydeth also the spettle of man, for it is hurtfull to him, and to the Sea-fish Scolopen∣dra, and yet he eateth many venemous herbes and groweth fat thereby; Aelianus and this also may be added, that Goats grow fat when they are with young, but by drinking of Honey they are weakened, and indaungered of death. Concerning their drinke, it is necessary for a skilfull Goat-herd to obserue the nature of the beast, and the best time and place of their watering, according to the saying of Virgill : —I be fronde tia Capris Arb ta sufficere, & fluuios prebere rerentes. In the Summer they are to be watered twice a day, and at other times once onely in the afternoone: but it is reported of the Goats of Cephalenia, Aristotle. Myndius. that they drinke not euery daie like other goats, but onely once or twice in six moneths, and therefore they turne them∣selues to the winde or cold aire of the sea, and by gawning, Aelianus. sucke into their mouths or bel∣lies that which serueth them instead of water. When the sun declineth, they lie and looke not vpon one another but on the contrary, and they which lodge in the fields take vppe their rest among their acquaintance. But if they be vsed to fold or house, they remember it, and repaire thither of their owne accord: which thing caused the Poet to write in this maner: Atque ipsae memores rede ntin tecta, suosque Ducunt: & graund superaut vix vbere limen. Concerning their stables or houses to lodge in for their defence against the colde, the diligent heard-man must obserue, that nothing must be layed vnder the Goat to lie vpon, and it is best to make his stable vpon stones, or some such hard flower, and the same must bee kept and turned drie euery day from annoyance of their dung, for that hurteth their heads. It is good to set the window of their stable to the Sun, and from the wind, Columella. according to the counsell of Virgill ; Et stabula a ventis hyberno opponere soli, Ad medium conuersa diem cum frigidus olim Iam cadit extremoque irrorat Aquarius anno. Although goats be stronger then sheepe, yet they are neuer so found, for in buying and selling of them, he was neuer accounted a wise man, that either hoped to buy, or promi∣sed to sell without fault. It was sufficient in open market places, when and where goats wer to be sold, to promise, Hodie capras recte esse & bibere posse & eas licite habere, that is, that the day of their sale they were well, and could drinke, and they were his owne, and it was lawfull for him to haue them. But farther no man was vrged, for ( Archelaus sayth) they are euer febricitante, because their breath is whotter, and their copulation more fiery, and therefore their heardmen must not be vnprouided of good and sufficient medicine to helpe them, and not onely a∣gainst their naturall diseases, but also their continual horn-wounds which they giue one a∣nother by their often fightings, and also when they aspire to climb vpon steepe and cra∣gy pointed rockes or trees, they often fall and are wounded, in such cases they haue no such Physitian as their keeper, whose bagge and box must be as an Apothecaries shoppe to yeelde continuall remedies to all their agreeuances. The best meanes to preserue them in health next to a good diet and warme lodging, is, to plant Alysson neere to their stabling houses. And their continuall ague spoken of before is profitable to their body, for when it departeth and leaueth them, presently they perish and die. Sheepe and Goats haue a natural foresight of the pestilence or murrain, Florentinus. of earth∣quakes, and of wholesome temperate Weather, and of aboundance and store of fruites; but neither of both shall bee euer infested by the pestilence, if you giue them the power of a Storkes Ventricle or mawe one spoonfull therof in Water euery day. Quintilius. And whereas all other kind of Cattell when they are sicke consume and pule away by little and little, onely Goates perish suddenly, insomuch as all that are sicke are vnreco∣uerable, and the other of the flocke must be instantly let blood and separated before the infection ouerspread all, and the reason of their sudden death, is because of their a∣boundance of foode, which ministerth speedy flaxe for the fire of their disease to burne. At such times they must not feede all the day long, but onely thrice or foure times a day be led forth to grasse, and brought in againe to their stables. If any other sicknesse annoy them they are to be cured with reede, and the rootes of white Thorne beate together with yron Pestles, and mingled with raine Water, and so giuen to the Cattell to be drunke: but if this medicine helpe not, then either sell them a∣way, or else kill them, and salt them till you minde to eate them. Goates are not troubled with Lice or Nits but onely with Tickes. There is a certaine Wine called Melampodion, the report is that one Melampos a shep∣herd had it reuealed vnto him, to cure the madnesse of a Goates: it is made of blacke Elle∣bor, and goats milke. Goats are also molested and subiect to the falling sicknesse and this is knowne by their voyce and cold most braines; Coelius. and therefore the Roman priests were commaunded too abstaine from touching such beasts. They are also troubled with the gowt; the Female-goate easeth the paine of her eyes by pricking them vpon a Bul-rush, and the Male-goate by pricking them vpon a Thorne, and so pituitous matter followeth the pricke, whereby the sight is recouered without a∣ny harme done to the Apple; Aelianus. and from hence it is supposed, that the Physitians learned their Parakeutesis pricking of so e eies with a needle. The Females neuer winke in their sleepe, being heerein like the Roe-buckes. There are certaine birds (called Capri-mulgi ) because of their sucking of Goates, and when these or any of them haue sucked a Goate she presently falleth blinde. If at any time she be trou∣bled with the Dropsie, Pliny. an yssue must be made vnder her shoulder, and when the humour is auoyded, stop vp the hole with liquid pitch. They drinke the seede of Seselis to make them haue an easie deliuerance of their younge, and for that cause Columella prescribeth a pinte of sod corne and Wine to be infused into their throates in that extremity; their other maladies being like vnto sheepe, we will reserue their description and cure to that History. Probus These Goates haue in auncient times beene vsed for sacrifices, not onely by the So∣ueraigne commaunde of almightye God, but also by the practise of Heathen people, for their perfect sacrifice which consisted of a Ram, a goate, a Hog, and a Bull, was called He∣catombe and Tryttis. The reason why Swine and goates were sacrificed among the heathen, was because the Swine dig vp the earth with their Noses, and rooted out the Corne, they were sacri∣ficed to Ceres ; and the Goates spoile the Vines by biting, for which cause, they sacrificed him to Bacchus ; that so the drunken God might bee pacified with the bloode of that Beaste, whose hallowed grapes hee had deuoured: Whereuppon the Poet Wryteth thus: Sus dederat poenas exemplo territus horum Palmite debueras abstinuisse Caper Quem spectans aliquis dentes in vite permentem Talia non tacito dicta dolore dedit Rode caper vitem tamen hinc cum stabis adaras In tua quod spargi cornua possit, erit. When they sacrificed a goate in Graecia, they tried him by giuing him Pease or cold water to drinke, which if he refused, they also refused him for sacrifice, but if he tasted it, they tooke and offered him. Martiall hauing seene or rather heard of a Countrey priest, sacrifising a goate, and being assisted by a Countrey man, when the beast was slaine the priest commaunded the poore countrey man to cutte off the stones, Teter vt immunda carnis abiret odar, to let the vnwholsome vapour of the vncleane flesh out of the body. Afterward the priest be∣ing busie about the sacrifice, and stooping downe to the carkeise of the beast, his coddes appeared behinde him betwixt his legges, the which when the countrey man saw, hee sud∣denly cut them off with his sharpe knife, thinking that the auncient ceremony of fasting required this to be done: whereupon Martiall wrot this Epigram, Sic modo qui Tuscus fueras, nunc Gallus aruspeae Dum ingulas hircum factus es ipse caper. The Mendesians worshipped Goates both males & females, Gyraldus because as they imagine they were like to their God Pan. The Egyptians also deified the male goate for his genitall members, as other nations did Priapus. The Gentiles had also a brazen goate, where∣upon Venus rode in brasse, which picture they called ( Pandemon ) and Venus (Epitragia,) I thinke that lust could not be better described then by this emblem, for venereous per∣sons will suffer their whoores to doe any disgrace vnto them, for their carnall pleasure. And thus much for these male and female goates, now follow the stories of the wilde goates and the kids in order. OF THE GOATE, CALLED by PLINY a DEERE. T Here is no man that shall see this beast, but will easily yeeld vnto my opinion, that it is a goate & not a deere, the hair, beard and whole proportion of body most euidently de∣monstrating so much, neither is there any difficultie herein, except for the horne which turne forward at the point and not backward, which thing yet swarueth not so much from a goate as from a deare, and therefore can be no good reason to alter my opinion. There are of this kinde as Doctor Cay affirmeth in the Northerne part of England, and that figure which is engrauen at Rome in a marble piller being a remem∣brance of some Triumphe which Pliny setteth forth, differeth in no part from this beasts description and proportion. Yet I take it that it may be brought into England from some other nation and so be seene in some Noble mans house, but that it should be bred there, I cannot finde any monument of authoritie, but rather I coniecture the same to be bred in Spain. Of these kinds there are three Epigrams in martiall whereby is declared their mutuall fights killing one another: their feare of dogges, and their flesh desired both of men and beasts. The first Epigram describing their wilfull fight one killing another and so sauing a labour to the hunter, for they kill themselues to his hand, is thus. Frontibus aduersis molles concurrere damas, Spectauere canes praedam stupuit{que} superbus, Vnde leues animae tanto caluere furore? Aspicis imbelles tenent quam fortia damae In mortem paruis concurrere frontibus audent Vidimus & fati sorte iacere pari Venator cultro nil superesse suo Sic pugnant Tauri sic cecidere viri. The second Epigram is a Dialogue speaking to the Emperour, who tooke care to encrease his game, seeing not onely men were enemies to them but they also to one another, where∣vpon he writeth this distichon; Praelia tam timidis quanta sit ixa feris Vis Caesar damis parcere, mitte canes. The thirde Epigram is a complaint of their weake and vnarmed state, hauing neither teeth like Bores, not hoenes like Harts to defend themselues, but lie open to the violence of all their enemies: Dente timetur Aper defendunt cornua ceruum Imbelles damae quid nisi preda sumus. These are of a whitish yellow colour on the back, and are nourished sometime for the plea∣sure, and somtime for the profit of their possessors, for they wil suffer hunting like a Deere and also be tamed for milke like a Goat. And heere of I finde no other especiall mention a∣mong Authors beside that which is already rehearsed. OF THE WILDE GOAT, AND THE figure of the Heluetian Alpian wilde or Rocke-Goat. W Ilde-goats are transfigured into many similitudes, and also dispersed in∣to many countries beyond the seas and in the Alpes, the picture of the Alpine wilde Goat is heere set down. They are also to be found in Italy, in the mountaines of Fiscela and Tetrica, Varro insomuch as the tame goats which are nourished there, are said to be deriued of these wilde goats, these are calld Cinthian Goats, because they are bred in the mountaines of Delos called Cinthus. There are of these which are found in the tops of the Libian mountaines as great as Oxen, whose shoulders and legges abound with loose-shaggy haire, their shinnes small, their faces are rounde, their eies are hollowe and hard to be seene. Their hornes crooking backward to their shoulders, not like other Goats, for they stand farre distant one from another: and among all other Goats they are indued with a most singuler dexterity of leaping, for they leap from one top to another, standing a great way asunder, and although many times they fall downe vpon the hard rocks, which are inter∣posed betwixt the Mountaines, yet receiue they no harme: for such is the hardnesse of their members, to resist that violence, and of theyr hornes to breake their fals, that they neither are offended thereby in head nor legs. Such are the Goates of Soractum as Cato Writeth, which leape from Rocke to rocke, aboue threescore foote: of this kind are those Goates before spoken off in the History of the tame Goat, which are thought to breath out of their eares, and not out of their No∣strils; they are very swift and strong horned, the loue betwixt the Dammes and the Kids in this kind, is most admirable; for the Damme doth most carefully educate and nourish her young, the younge ones againe, doe most thankefully recompence their mothers carefulnesse, much like vnto reasonable men, which keepe and nourish theyr owne pa∣rents in their old decrepit age, (which the loue of God and nature doth enioyn them) for satisfaction of there owne education, so doe these young wild Goates, toward their owne mothers: for in their age they gather their meate and bring it to them, and likewise they runne to the riuers or watering places, and with their mouthes sucke vp water, which they bring to quench the thirst of their parentes: and when as their bodies are Ruffe and vg∣lye to looke vppon, the younge ones licke them ouer with their tongues, so making them smooth and neate. And if at any time the Damme be taken by the Hunters, the young one doth not for∣sake her till he be also insnared: and you would thinke by the behauiour of the imprisoned Damme towards her young Kids, and likewise of the Kid towards his Damme, that they mutually contend one to giue it selfe for the other: for the dam forseeing her yong one to houer about her in the handes of her enemies, and continually to follow; with sighes and teares seemeth to wish and perswade them to depart, and to saue themselues by flight, as if they could say in the language of men, Fugite filij infestos venatores ne me miseram capti materno nomine priuate ; that is to say, Runne away my sons, saue your selues from these harmefull and greedy Hunters, least if you be taken with me, I be for euer depriued of the name of a mother. The young ones againe on the other side wandering about their mo∣ther, bleate forth many a mournefull songe, leaping to the Hunters and looking in their faces, with pittifull asspects, as if they said vnto him; we adiure you (oh Hunters) by the maker of vs al, that you deliuer our mother from your thraldome, and in sted of her take vs hir vnhappy children, bend your hard harts, feare the lawes of God which forbiddeth innocents to be punished, and consider what reuerence you owe to the olde age of a mo∣ther; therefore againe (we pray you) let our liues satisfie you for our dammes liberty. But poor creaturs, when they see that nothing can moue the vnexerable mind of the hunters, they resolue to dye with her whom they cannot deliuer, and thereupon of their owne accord, giue themselues into the handes of the Hunters, and so are led away with their mother. Concerning the Libyan goates before spoken off, which liue in the tops of Mountaines, they are taken by nets, or snares, or else killed by Darts and arrowes, or some other art of Hunting. But if at any time they discend downe into the plaine fieldes they are no lesse troubled, then if they were in the waues of some great water. And therefore any man of a slow pace may there taken them, without any great difficulty. The greatest benefit that ariseth from them is their skinne and their hornes, with their skinnes they are clothed in Winter time against tempests, Frostes and Snowe, and it is a common weede for Shepherds, and Carpenters. The hornes serue them in steed of buc∣kets, to draw Water out of the running streames, wherewithall they quench their thirst, for they may drinke out of them, as out of cups; They are so great, that no man is a∣ble to drinke them off at one draught, and when cunning artifficers haue the handling of them▪ they make them to receiue three times as much more. The selfe same things are Wryten of the Wilde Goates of Egypt, who are said neuer to be hurt by Scorpions. There is a great Citty in Egypt (called Coptus ) who were wont to be much addicted to the worship of Isis, and in that place there are great aboundance of Scorpions, which with their stings and poyson, do oftentimes giue mortall and dead∣ly woundes to the people, whilest they mourne about the Chappell (for they worship that Goddesse) with funeral lamentation: against the stinging of these Scorpions: the E∣gyptians haue inuented a thousand deuises whereof this was the principall: At the time of their assembly, they turne in wild fem: goats naked among the Scorpions lying on the ground, by whose presence they are deliuered and escape free from the woundes of the Serpents, whereupon the Coptites doe religiously consecrate these female Goats to de∣uinity, thinking that their Idoll Isis did wholy loue them, and therfore they sacrificed the males but neuer the females. It is reported by Plutarch that wilde Goates doe aboue other meate loue meale and figges, wherefore in Armenia there are certaine black Fishes which are poyson; with the pouder or meale of these fishes they couer these figges, and cast them abroad where the Goates do haunt, and assoone as the beasts haue tasted them, they presently die. Now to the wilde Goat before pictured, called in Latine Rupi Capra and Capricornus, and in Greek a Gargos, and Aigastros, and of Homer Ixalon, of the Germanes Gemmes or Gemmuss, the Rhetians which speake Italian, call it Camuza, the Spaniards Capramontes, the Polonians Dzykakoza, the Bohemians, Korytanski Kozlik ; that is to say, a Carinthian Goate, because that part of the Alpes called Carinthia is neere bordering vpon Bohemia. Bellanius writeth, Albertus. that the French cal him Chambris, and in their ancient tongue Ysard, this is not very great of bodye, but hath crooked hornes which bend backeward to his back, whereupon he staieth himselfe when he falleth from the slippery Rockes or Moun∣taines. Plinyus These hornes are not fit to fight they are so small and weake, and therefore nature hath bestowed them vpon them for the cause aforesaid. Of all other Goats this is the least, it hath red eies, but a qu cke eie-sight, his hornes are blacke, being nine or ten fingers longe, and compassed about with diuers circles, but at the top none at all, which is sharp and crooked like a hooke. They arise at the roote Paralelwise, that is by equall distance one from another, being hollow the bredth of ones Thumbe, the residue solide like the Harts. The Males in this kinde differ not from the Females, neither in horne, colour, or pro∣portion of body: they are in bignesse like the common Goate, but somewhat hier. Their colour is betwixt brown and red. In the Summer time they are red, and in the winter time they are browne. There hath beene seene of them which were white and blacke in distinct colour one from another, and the reason heere of is, because they chaunge colour many times in the year. There are some of them altogether white, but these are seldome found; they inhabit for the most part the Rockes or Mountaines, but not the tops like the Ibe ks, neither doe they leape so far as the foresaid goats. They come down somtime to the roots of the Alpes, and there they licke sand from the rockes, like as the village tame goates to procure them an appetite. The Heluetians call these places in their naturall tongue Fultzen, that is Salares : about these places do the Hunters hide themselues and secretly with guns, bowes, or other such instrumentes they suddendly shoote and kill them. When they are hunted they step vp to the steepest rocks, and most inaccessible for Dogges, by that meanes prouiding their own safty: bu if the hunters presse after them and clime vpon the rocks, with hands, and feet, they leape from thence, from stone to stone, making their waie to the tops of the Moun∣taines, so long as euer they are able to goe or climbe, and then they hange by the Hornes of their heade, as if they were ready to fall, which caused Martiall to write thus: Pendentem summa Capream de rupe videbis Casuram speres decipit illa Canes. Where the Poet attributeth that to the Roe which belongeth to the wilde goat, and there they hange many times till they perish, because they cannot loose themselues againe, or else they are shotte with guns, or fall downe headlong, or else are driuen off by the hun∣ters. From the day of Saint Iames they vse themselues to the coldest partes of the Moun∣tains, because they vnderstand winter is approaching, making custome to be their shield against cold weather: there haue bene some of these made tame, so that they haue discen∣ded downe to the flocks of tame Goats, whome they do not auoide like the Ibex. From these wilde goats hath that same herbe (called Doronicum ) and of the Grecians, Doronieu, giuen a name among the Germaines Geniesseh Worts, that is, wilde-goats-herb, being excellent to cure the Collick, and therefore highly esteemed among the Arabians Graecians, and Mauritanians. It is hot and dry in the second degree, and the countrey peo∣ple in Heluetia do giue it against dizines in the head, because these wilde goats oftentimes feed vpon the same, and yet are neuer troubled with that infirmity, although they runne round about the mountaines. There are hunters which drinke the blood of this goat comming hot out of his body, immediately after the wound giuen, against that sicknes. The fat & milke of a wilde goat mingled together, haue cured one long sick of the Ptisick. The wilde goats of Creet, being wounded with poysoned Dartes, runne presently and eate of the hearbe Dittani, by the vertue and iuice whereof, they not onely auoid the arrow which sticketh in their skin, but also death, and cure the poyson. OF THE KYD. H Auing formerly discoursed of seuerall kindes of Goates, Of the name now it fol∣loweth that we should also intreat of the Kid which is the yssue of a Goat; and first of the seuerall names therof. It is called in Haebrew Egedi, which because it signifieth also a Lambe, they put vnto it Haissim, and the plurall masculine is Gedaijm, and the feminine Gedi∣oth, Gen. 35. where the Caldean translation hath Gadeia, the Persian Bus-kahale, or else Cahali busan ; for the Persians render Cahale for Sheter, in Haebrew Busan, for Issim. The Septuagints render Erifon, and vulgarly at this day, the Grecians cal him Eriphoi, but the truth is, that Eriphoi are kids of three or foure months old, and after that time vntill their procreation, Varinus they are called Chimaroi, the Latines cal him Hoedi ab edendo, from eating (as Isidorus saith) for then their flesh is tender and fat, and the tast therof pleasant. The Italians call it Cauretto, or Capret∣to, and Ciauerello ; the Rhetians which speak Italian, Vlzol: the Spaniardes Cabrito, the French Chereru, the Germans Gitse, or Kitslain, the Polonians Koziel. It was a question whether nature would finish her parts vpon a young one out of the dams belly, wherefore a triall was made vpon a kid which neuer saw his dam, for vpon a season a dissexion was made vpon a Female-goate great with young, and out of her belly was her young one taken aliue, so as it could neuer see the mother; the same kid was put into a house where were many boales full of wine, oyle, milke, and Hony, and other ly∣quid thinges: there also lay beside him diuers kindes of fruits, both of the vine, of corne, and of plants; at last this kid was seene to arise and stand vpon his feete, and as if somebo∣dy had told him that his Legges were made to walke vpon, he shooke off all that moist∣nesse which he brought with him out of his mothers belly, afterwardes he scratched his side with his foote, and then went and smelled at all the former vessels, and at last comming to the milke-boule, he supped and licked thereof, which when the behoulders saw, they all cryed out that Hipocrates rule was most true, Animalium naturas esse indoctas, that is to say, the natures of creatures are not formed by Art, but of their owne inclination. There is nothing more wanton then a Kid, whereupon Ouid made this verse: Splendidior vitro tenero lasciuior hoedo. They often iumpe and leape among themselues, and then they promise faire weather, Aelianu ▪ but if they keep continually with the flocks and depart not from their mothers, or continually sucke and licke vp their meat: also they for-shew a storm, and therfore they must be gathe∣red to their folds, according to the Poets saying; si sine fine modoque : Pabula delbent cum tutas vesper adire Compellat caulas monstrabunt ad fore nimbos. If Geese swallow the haires of Kids or Goats they die thereof Kids are not to be separated from their Dammes, A atolius Varro or weaned till they be three months old, at which time they may be ioyned to the flockes: they are nourished when they are young after the same manner as they be at a year old, except that they must be more narrowly looked vnto, least their las∣ciuiousnesse ouerthrow their age: and besides their Milk, you must giue vnto them three leaued-grasse, Palladius Iuy, and the toppes of lentiles tender leaues, or small twigges of trees: and whereas commonly they are brought forth in twinnes, it is best, to choose out the strong∣est headed kid for the flock, and to sel the other away to the Butchers. Out of the rennet of the Calues or Kids is the Coagulation. There was a certaine law (as appeareth by Baifyus ) in the bookes of the ciuill Lawyers, that shooes should be made of the skinnes of Kids, as appeared by auncient Marble mo∣numents at Rome, which thing Martiall approueth in his verses to Phebus ; shewing how time altereth al things and that the skins of kids which were wont to couer bald heads, are not put vpon bare legs; the verses are these that follow, Oedina tibi pelle Contegenti Nudae tempore verticemque caluae Fefliue tibi phebe dixit ille Qui dixit c put esse calciatum. Albertus Out of the hide of a Kid is made good glue, and in the time of Cicero they stuffed beddes with Kids haire: their flesh hath been much esteemed for delicate meat; & for that cause dressed and trimmed sundry waies; the best Kids for meate haue been said to come from Melos, or Vmbratia, or Viburtinum, which neuer tasted grasse, but haue more milke in them then blood; according to the saying of Iuuenall : De viburtino veniet pinguissimus agro Hoedulus & toto grege mollior nescius herbae H c dum ausus virgas humilis mordere falicti. For this cause they may safely be eaten all the yeare long while they sucke, both of men of temperate and whot constitution, Arnoldus for they are lesse hurtfull then the Rammes, and doe easily disgest, and nourish temperately, for they engender thinne and moyst blood, and al∣so helpe all whot and temperate bodies, and they are at the best when as they are neither too olde, that is aboue sixe monthes, nor two younge, that is vnder two monethes. The red or sandy coloured are the best, yet is their flesh hurtfull to the Collicke. Si∣meon Sethi affirmeth, that if a man eate a kids liuer before he drinke in the morning, he shal not be ouer drunke that day. Celtus also prescribeth it in the sickenesse of the Holy-fire. They are wholesome, sod, roasted, or baked, but the ribs are best sodde. Platina teacheth one way whereby it was dressed in his time for a delicate dishe; they tooke some fielde Herbes and fat broath, twoe Whites of an Egge well beaten together, with twoo heades of Garlike, a little Saffron, and a little Pepper, with the Kiddes flesh, put all together into a dish rosted before at the fire, vpon a spitte (with Parsely, Rosemary, and Lawrel leaues) and so serud out with that sauce, and set it on the table: but if they did not eate it before it was colde, it weakened the eye sight, and raised vp venerial lust. The bloode also of a Kid was made into a bludding, and giuen to be eaten of them which haue the bloody-flixe. They haue also deuised to dresse a Kidde whot, and to fill his belly with Spices and other good things: likewise it is sod in Milke with Lawrell, with diuers other fashions, which euery Cooke is able to practise without the knowledge of learning. And thus I might conclude the discourse of Kiddes with a remembraunce of their constellation in the Waggoner, vppon the Bulles Horne, which the Poets ob∣serue for signes and tokens foreshewing Rayn and Clowdy weather, according to Virgils verse: Quantus ab occasu veniens pluuialibus, Hoedi. These Starres rise in the Euening about the Nones of October and in December, they were wont to sacrifice a kid with wine to Faunus. There is a byrd called Captilus which is a great deuourer of kiddes and Lambes, and the same also is hunted by a Dragon, for when she hath filled hir selfe with these beastes, being wearied and idle, the Dragon doth easily set vpon hir and ouer take her. Also when they fish for the Worm seuen Cubits long in the Riuer Indus, they bait their hooke with a lambe or Kid, as is reported by Aelianus ; and the auncientes were wont by inspection into the intrals of Kiddes, to declare or search into thinges to come, as Gyraldus amongst other their superstitious vanities rehear∣seth. The manifold medicinall properties of Goates come now in the end of this story to be declared, and first of all it is to bee noted, that these properties are seuerall, both in the Male, female, and Kidde; and therefore they are not to be confounded, but as the dely∣gence of learned Authors hath inuented, and left them seuerally recorded, so they re∣quire at our hands which are the heyres of such benificiall helpes, the same care and need∣full curtisie. There are some which doe continually nourish Goates in stables neere their dwelling Houses with an opinion that they help to continue them in health, Plinyus The medi∣cines arising out of male Goates. for the ancientes or∣dained that a man which had beene bitten or stroke by Serpents, and could not easily be cured thereof, should bee lodged in a Goates stable. The haires of a Goate-bucke bur∣ned and perfumed in the presence or vnder a man whose genitall is decayed it cureth him. Sextus. The poulder of a Wine bottell made of a Goates skinne with a little Rozen doeth not onely stanch the bloode of a greene-wounde, but also cure the same. The powder of the Horne with Nitre and Tamariske seede, butter, and Oyle▪ Pliny after the head is shauen by an∣nointing it therewith strengthneth the haire from falling off, when it groweth againe and cureth the Alopecia, and a horne burnt to powder and mingled with meale, Sextus cureth the chippings in the head and the scabs: for taking away the smell of the arme-pits, they take the Horne of an old Goat and either scrape or burne the same, then adde they to it a like quantity of Mirrhe, the Goates gall, and first scrape or shaue off the haire, and afterward rub them therewith euery day and they are cured by that perfrication. Dioscorides The bloud fryed in a panne, and afterwardes drunke with Wine, Aetius. is a preseruatiue a∣gainst intoxications, and cureth the bloody-flixe, and the bloode in a Seare-cloath is ap∣plyed against the goute, and clenseth away all Leprosies, and if the bloode come forth of the Nose without stay, then rubbe the Nose with this bloud of a Goate. It being fitted to meate cureth all the paines of the inward partes: being sodde vppon coales stayeth the loosenesse of the belly, and the same applyed to the belly mixed with fine flower, Marcellus and Rozen easeth the paine in the small guts; the same mixed with the marrow of a Goate which hath beene fed with Lentiles cureth the Dropsie, and being drunke alone breaketh the stone in the reines, and with Parsly drunke in Wine also dissolueth the stone in the bladder, and preuenteth all such calculating grauell in time to come. There is a Medicine called by the Apothecaryes Diuina manus, Gods hand, against the stone, and they make it in this manner. When Grapes begin to waxe ripe, Albertus. they take a new earthen pot and poure into it Water, and seeth the same till all the scumme or earthy sub∣stance thereof be eiected: & the same pot clensed, then take out of the flock a Male Goat of foure year old, or thereabouts, and receiue his blood as it runneth forth of his slaugh∣tered body into that pot, so as you let goe the first and last streame thereof to the ground and saue the residue: then let it thicken in the pot, and so being therein congealed, break it into many pieces with a reede, and then couering it with some linnen cloth, and set it a∣broad in the day time where it may gather dew, and then the next day set it abroad in the Sunne againe to exhale the same dew, (if in the meane time there fall no raine) then let it dry, and afterward make thereof a powder, and preserue it in a boxe, and when the euill pincheth, vse a spoonefull of it with Wine of Creete, and Philagrius commendeth the ma∣nifold benefit heereof, for he had often tryed it, and with a medicine made of an Affrican Sparrow mixed with this, he procured one to make water, and to void a great stone which had not vented his vrine in many daies, and liued in the meane time in horrible paynes, and the same vertue is attrybuted heereunto, if it bee annointed neere the bladder, and one be bathed in the warme aire and so oftentimes both the bath and the ointment be re∣iterated. Marcellus teacheth how one may make tryall of the vertue of this blood, for if he take a Male-goate, and put him vp close seuen daies, feeding him in the meane time continually with baies, and afterward cause a young Boy to kil him, and receiue his bloud in a bladder, and put in the said bladder sandy stones like vnto those that are engendered in the bladder of man, within short time he shall see those stones dissolued and scarce to be found in the bladder of blood, by which he confidently affirmeth, that nothing in the World is of like power to remooue the stone, but withal he willeth some superstitious ob∣seruations, as namely that he be killed by a chast person: and on a thursday or sunday or such like: but the conclusion is that the saide blood must bee dryed to powder in an Ouen, and afterward prescribeth that three ounces heereof, one ounce of Time, one ounce of Peniroyall, three ounces of burned Polypus, one ounce of white Pepper, one ounce of Apian, and one ounce of Loueage-seede to be giuen to the party in sweet wine fasting, and hauing no meat in his stomack vndigested, and hauing digested the medicine he must eat presently. And therefore if it be true as all antiquity and experience approueth, that the Goates blood breaketh and dissolueth the Adamant stone, then much more (saith Iacobus Siluius ) may it worke vppon the stone in a mans bladder. The flesh of Goats decocted in Water, take away all bunches and kernels in the body. Pliny The fat of this beast is more moysT then a females or a kids, and therefore it is most strong in operation, to scatter, dissolue, and re∣solue more then a sheep. Dioscorides. It cureth all fissures in the lippes mixed with Goose-greace, Rozen, Pitch, and the marrow of a Hart. Also if one be troubled with swellings in his Temples or in his Legges, let him vse of this sewet halfe a pound, and a pound of Capons-greace mixed therewith, and spreading it vpon a cloth like a seare-cloth, let him apply it to the sore and it shall help mightily. Marcellus Also when the necke of an Oxe swelleth, it hath been prooued for a golden remedy, to take and annoint it with Goates-greace, liquid Pitch, the marrowe of a Bugle or Oxe, and olde Oyle, and may as well be called Tetrapharmacum, as that of Galen made of Wax, Rozen, Columella Pitch, and Goates-sewet. Also if the blood be fallen into Oxens Legges, it must be let forth, or else it will breed the mange; and therefore first of all the place must be cut with a knife, and then rubbed with clouts wet in salt and oile, and last of all annointed with old sewet and Goats-greace. Rasis Two ounces of this Goates-greace and a pinte of greene Oyle mixed together, and melted in a potte, and infused into one that hath the bloody-flixe, cureth him speedily: when the whot dung or fime of a Goate is mixed with Saffron and applyed to the gouty members Hydropicke, it worketh vpon them a strange cure: and some ad heerunto the stalks of Iuy beaten, Mustard-seed, and the flower of wilde Cucumber. The Lyuer of this beast layed vppon a man that hath beene bitten by a mad Dogge, causeth him neuer to be afrayd of Water: the same being sodde, yealdeth a certaine ly∣quor, Galen. and sore eyes being annointed with that liquor, within twelue times recouer; and drunke in sharpe Wine, and layed to the Nauell, stayeth the fluxe; also sod in Wine no scumme or froth being taken off from it, but permitted to ioine with it, helpeth the bloo∣dy-flixe. Myrepsus The entralles of a Goate eaten are profitable against the falling sicknesse. The Gall killeth the Leprosie, al swellings and Botches in such bodyes, and being mingled with Cheese, Quicksiluer, and powder of sponge, and made as thicke as hony, taketh away the spots and burles in the face. It also rooteth out and consumeth dead flesh in a wound, and also mingled with bran and the vrine of a Bull, cureth the scurffe in the head. Actius also teacheth women how to conceiue with childe, if she dip a purple cloth in Goats-blood, and apply it to her Nauell seuen daies, and afterwarde lie with a man in the prime and encrease of the Moone: the gall of a wilde Goat is commended priuately, for the helpe of them that are purblind, and for all whitenes and vlcers in the eies; and when the haires which trouble the eyes be pulled vp, if the place be anoynted with the gall of goates, the haire will neuer growe any more. The melt being sod, helpeth the Flix, and the Spleene taken hot out out of the beastes belly, and applied to the Spleene of a man, doeth within short time ease it of all paine, if afterward it be hanged vppe in any fume or smoake to be dryed. Albertus and Rasis say, Marcellus that if a man eat two Goats stones, and presently lye with his wife, she shall bring foorth a male childe, but if he eate but one, then shall the child haue but one stone. The fyme de∣cocted with Honny, and layed to vlcers and swellinges, dissolueth or draweth them, and mingled with Vineger, is most profitably vsed to take away blacke spottes in the face. And if hee which is sicke of the falling euill doe eate thereof fifteene pilles, or little Balles, it shall procure vnto him much ease. If it bee mingled with Mouse-dunge, Galen. toa∣sted at the fire and sprinkled with Honney, and so annointed vppon balde places, where you woulde haue the hayre to growe againe, and mingled with Vineger wherein a sea-onion hath bin st eped, and bound to the forehead or temples, asswageth the pain of the brain-pan. The pastorall Carthaginians, to the intent that the humour flowing out at their Chil∣drens noses, may neuer hurt them, burne a vaine in the crowne of the head with Wooll, when they are foure yeare old, and thereby they conceiue that they are kept and conser∣ued in perpetuall good health: and if when they burne their children, they fell into a crampe, they eased them presently by casting vppon them the vrine of goates. Herodotus. When a man is thicke of hearing, mingle together the gall of an Oxe, and the vrine of a Goate, and infused into the eares, although there bee in them a verye mattery sub∣stance. Galen prescribeth this potion to euacuate that Water which lyeth betwixt the skinne by Vrine, if one drinke Hysope Water and the vrine of a goat: Likewise it helpeth the Dropsie, and the duste of an Elephauntes tooth drunke in this goates Vrine, it dissolueth the stone in the reynes and bladder, without all fearefull perill and daun∣ger. The medicines arising out of the female goat are these, we find that the Female-goat, Pliny. and the land toad being sodden together, are cures of singular woorth for the diseases of all liuing foure-footed-beasts. The ( Magi ) or wisemen say, that the right eie of a greene liuing Lizard, being taken out and his hedforthwith strok off and put in a goats skin is of a great force against quartan Agues. The ashes of a goats hide besmeared ouer with oile, Pliny. taketh away the spots in the face. The same ashes made of a goates hide, recouereth the blisters and gals of the feet. The shauiug of the Goates skinne, Marcellus being rubbed with pum∣micestone, and mixed with Vineger, Pliny. is an excellent approued good remedy for the smal pox If a woman bleed ouermuch at the nose, Marcellus. let her breasts be bound with a thong made of a goats skinne. The same being sodden with the haire on it, the iuyce being soked vppe, Marcellus. staieth the belly. It is not good for those that haue the falling sicknesse to sleepe or lie in a goates skinne, if at any time the passion mooueth them to it; Pliny yet it is hurt∣full for their heade, by reason of the ranke smell, and not for any other particuler priuat cause. Goats haires being burnt, do appease all yssues of blood, Coelius Aureliaenus which being mixed with Vineger they are good to staunch the bleeding at nose, and you may blow in their nostrils goats haires burnt and whole, and also myrrhe mixed with goats haires so burnt. Aesculapius Sextus The same also burned and mingled with pitch and Vineger, helpeth the bleeding at nose, Gallen and being put in the nose they stir vp lethargies. Marcellus. Sextus. Pliny. The sauor of the Goats horne or of the haire doth the like, Goats dung in sweet water▪ doth expell the stone in the body, so doth the ashes of Goats haire in like mane , which being burned and brused, and giuen in a medicine, they doe mightily helpe and recouer the strangury. Marcellus It is also reported that Goats horne and the haires being burnt, will driue away Serpents: and their ashes soked or annoynted, is very good against strokes or sti ∣ging of Serpents. Plinyus. To stay the flux in the belly, take the hairs that grow behind on the Goats sitting place, and burne them, which being tempered with beaten Barly and oile, must be perfumed vn∣der a mans seat. Hippocrates Goats flesh being rosted by the fire where dead men are burnt, is good for those that haue the falling sicknes. The same is a good remedie against the falling sicknes. It is good for such to absteine from Hogs flesh, beefe, or Goats flesh. They that drinke goats blood wax pale presently on it, Sextus Coelius. which is excellent to get out spots of any thing: it also very good against those that are intoxicat with poyson, and therefore must be drunk with wine; and being sod with marrow, Marcellus it is good against the same disease, so is the male-Goates blood. The roote of sinke-foyle drunke in wine, helpeth il humors. Goats blood also, either of the male or of the female, Discorides aswageth the inwards and the flowings or laskes of the belly: it is good for those that haue the Dropsie, being tempered with honye, and also sodden with marrow. Some vse it against the bloodie Flix and paine of the belly, being also sodden with mar∣row, Pliny. it is good against the same disease. If you mix Goats blood with chisel sleept in broth and a little Rosin put into it, whereof make a plaister and lay it to the belly or other parts, and it recouereth any paine thereabouts. The fat of the male Goat is more faster, and therfore good for those that haue the bloo∣dy flix. Marcellinus The substance of a Goat is fat, yet is not the fat of a Goat so moist as a swines, but for bitings, & those that are grieued in their bellie goats fat is better then swines, not be∣cause it hath more operation in it to expell the greefe, but by reason it is thicke, whereas the Swines greace will run about like oyle: Galen. neither is the fat of Kyds so warme and dry as female-Goats, neither the male-Goats so fat as the gelded Goats, in Latin called ( Hircus ) also female-Goats fat is more binding then the allow of Oxen, but the males fat is good against Scorpions made in a perfume. It is also good for those that are poysoned with French green flyes called ( Cantharides. ) Aetius. Being tempered with wax is taketh away the stin∣ging of Serpents, it helpeth any biting or wound: If a womans breast grieue her after her deliuery of child, let her seeth husked Barley and scallions, and the fat of a male-Goate, whereof let her drinke a little. Against the ach of the eies, take Goats fat and sheeps togi∣ther, Pliny. with a little warme water. Almost euerie greef of the body if it be no woūd, wil be more easily recouerd by plaisters, but if the greefe be as it were grounded, Gallen (or an old greefe) let it be burned, and vpon the place so scorched, put Butter or the fat of a male-Goat, it will also recouer and heal kibes and Chilblanes. It helpeth the kings euill, so doeth the fat of the female-Goates helpe the same disease. Collumella The males fat mixed with Arsenicke, taketh away the roughnes of the nails: it also healeth the nailes of the Leprosie without any paine: it expelleth the Cartharid ns being applyed with the iuyce of the grape that groweth on a wilde Vine. This goates fat is profitable to helpe any about the straightnes of their mouths or lips, being tempred with wax it allaieth sores and blisters, Pliny. and with pitch and Brimstone it healeth them, and being applied with hony and the iuyce of a brambell, it cureth the swellings arising in the hands or fingers, especially in curing of fellons. The fat of a Bull well salted, or if it be in an ach or griefe, dipt it in oile without salt, and so after the same manner is the Male-goats fat vsed, which being tempered with roses, ta∣keth away the wheales or blisters that riseth in the night, being also dropped into the ears of one that is deafe, it recouereth him. It helpeth the falling sicknes, putting thereto as much of the gal of Buls, iust of the same weight, Aesculapius and seeth it together, and then laie it in the skinne of the gall that it touch not the ground, and drinke it out of the water. It is also good against the stinging of Scorpions being applied with Butter and the meale of ( Zea ) warmed and washed with red Wine. The broath that is confected of Goats fat sodden, Dioscorides is excellent for those that are trou∣bled with the Pthisicke, to sup now and then a fewe, also it helpeth the cough being tem∣pered with new sweet wine, that an ounce may be put in a goblet & so mixed with a branch of Rue. It being also sodden with husked barly, easeth those that haue fretting in the guts. The same also sodden with barley flower and wine made of pomegranates and Cheese, Mar illus let it be giuen to those that are troubled with the bloody flixe, and let them take it with the iuyce of husked barly. Rasis also saith, that the fat of a fierce Lyon is of such singular account, that if a gly∣ster be made of it, with the water of barly sod, either with the water of tosted meale, Dioscorides and boyled Sunach, and so dissolued with waxe, it is a most pretious remedy for the swelling of the inwards. But Goats fat doth much help the griefes of the inward parts that nothing commeth forth but cold water. Pliny. The fat of the Buck-goat many vse (being sod with bread and ashes) against the bloody flixe, and also the she-goates fat being taken out of her back alone being a little cold, and then supped vp: Other allow the fat to be sodden with Bar∣ly flower, Cinnamon, annise, and vineger mixed together. The same fat taken so out of the backe mixed with barly bran, and Cinnamon, annise, and vineger, Pliny. of each of them a∣like, and seeth thereof, and being strained giue it the patient that is diseased with the bloo∣dy flixe, and it shall most speedily help him. The same also mixed with Pellitory and Ciprian Waxe, may be laide to the gowte. Marcellus Also sodden with Goates Dunge and Saffron, and layed on the gout it asswageth the griefe. The marrow of the Female-goate, in the forth place next after the marrow of the Hart, the Calfe, and the Bull is commended of Dioscorides, but the last of all is the sheeps fat. The Harts is most renowned of all, next the Calues, then the Buck-goats, and last of all the Female-goats. To help the griefe of eies. Take the marrow of Goats, and annoynt your eies, and it will cure them. Goates blood sodde with marrow may be taken against all toxicall poyson. Pliny saith, that theyr dung being annointed with Hony, is good for the watering or dropping of the eyes, and their marrow against aches. The blood of Goates, their mar∣row, and their Liuer, is very good to ease the belly. Goates blood sodden with the mar∣row helpeth the blody flix, and those that haue the dropsie, and yet I think that the bucks is more effectual and of greater operation so it be eaten with mastick. Also the goats mar∣row is good for the eies of Horses. The right Horne of a Goat is of some held to be of more effect then the other, Pliny which I rather hold to be superstitious, Pliny. whatsoeuer other reason or secret quality the Horne may afford for the bitings of Serpents, take Goates horne and burne the haires of them, and the ashes of them soked in Water, and Goates Milke with the horne, and wilde Mar∣gerom, and three cups of wine put together, and being drunk against the stinging of an ad∣der expelleth the poison. Sextus. The ashes of Goates horne being all annointed with Oyle, tempered with Mirtle, stayeth the sweating of the body. Harts horne and Goats being burned and (if it be requi∣site) is good to wash the teeth withall, and it will make them looke white, Plinius and the gums soft. It is also good against the bloody-flixe, and watering of the eyes in regard they are most vsuall. Yet they neither asswage the griefes nor consume them, which are of a could and dry nature. Harts horne being burnt as also a Goates horne, taketh away bitings. Goates dung or the horne being burnt to ashes, and dipped in vineger, stoppeth the blood. Gallen The corrupt blood that commeth out of the Lyuer of a Bucke-Goate is more effectuall and of a better operation, and the ashes of a Goates horne or dung soked in Wine or vineger and annoint the Nostrils, stayeth bleeding at the Nose. Plinius Goates Horne being burned at the end, and the pieces or scorchinges that rise thereof, must be shaken into a new ves∣sell vntill the horne be quite consumed, then beate and bruise them with vineger made of Sea-onyons, and anoint the euill called Saint Anthonies fire, and it is of a miraculous operation. ius It will make one sleepe that is troubled with the weakenesse of his head and watching, if it be layed vnder their pillow. It being mixed with bran and oyle of mirtle, it keepeth the haires fast that are falling off the head. The sauour of the Horne burned descrieth the falling sicknes, so doth the smell of the intrals of a Goat or the liuer eaten: likewise it raiseth vp a lethargick man. They vse also the hornes of Harts and Goats to make white the teeth and to fasten the gums. The same shorne or shauen into mixt Hony, represseth the fluxe of the belly: In the paine of the belly perfume the shauings of the same, mingled with oile & burned barly, the same perfume is good to be laid vpon the vlcers of horses. The hoofes of Goats are prescribed by Palladius to be burned for the driuing away of Serpentes, and the dust of them put into vineger cureth the Alopecias. The dust of their hoofes is good to rub the teeth withall, also to driue away the swellings in the disease called S. Anthonies fire. Burne the foote of the Goate with the horne, and reserue the dust thereof in a boxe, and when you will vse it wette the place, first with Wine, and afterwardes cast on the pow∣der. The iuyce of a goates head sod with haire, is commended for burstnesse in the belly, and the ancient Magicians gaue the braine of the goats to little infants against the falling sicknesse, but pressed through a golde ring, the same cureth carbunckles in the belly be∣ing taken with Hony. If the body or head bee rubbed with that Water or meate which falleth out of the mouth of a goate, mingled with hony and salt they kill all kinde of Lice, and the same thing giueth remedy to the paine of the belly, but if it be taken ouermuch it purgeth. The broath of the entrals to be gargarized in the mouth, cureth the exulceration of the toung and arteries. The Lyuer of the Female-goate sodde and eaten is giuen against the falling euill, and taketh from the conuulsion, and with the liquor thereof, after it is sod it is good to annoint the pur-blinde eies, Galen. Dioscorides also it is good to holde the eyes open ouer it while it seetheth, and to receiue into them the fume, and the reason heerof is because that goats see as perfectly in the night as in the day time, and therefore Celsus saith, that this medi∣cine is most agreeable to them that cannot see at all in the night, as it hapneth to women whose monethly courses are stopped, and then it is good for them to annoint theyr eies with the blood of a Goate, and eate the liuer sod or rosted. The pouder of the liuer burnd, purged and drunke in wine, cureth the collicke. If a woman in trauell or with childe be swollen vp, let her take a Goats liuer rowled in warme ashes, Trallianus and let her eat it in foure daies, and drinke old wine thereunto, so shall she be deliuered. The gall is contrary to all poysoned Witch-craft made vppon the rusticke Weasill, and if the Kings euill be dayly touched therewith at the beginning, it will keepe it from ouer-spreading, Pliny. and with beaten Alum it disperseth scabs: The old Magicians wer wont to say, that when a man rubbed his eies when he lay down, and put it vnderneath his pillow, Marcellus. he should sleepe soundly, it driueth away scabbes in the head if it be mingled with fullers chaulke, so as the haires may dry alittle, and the same with Honey helpeth the eies, according to the saying of Serenus : Hybt aei mellis succi cum felle caprino Subueniunt oculis dira caligine pressis. The Physitians in application heereof to the cure of eyes take many ways, and mix it with other drugs, as when they giue it against whitenesse in the eyes with Hellebore, againste wounds and pin and webs with wine, and against the broken tunicles with a womans milk, and therefore Rasis and Albertus do iustly call the gal of a goat an eie-salue, and also bee∣ing instilled into the eares when they are ful of paine, it cureth them, first mingling it with a scruple of Hony in an earthen sheard, Marcellus. and so infusing it into the eare, and shutting it in with a little wooll. Also all the paines in the eares are cured by the stalkes or iuyce of leekes, gall of Goats, and sweete water; and if there be any rupture in the eare then vse therewith a Womans milke, or warme oyle of roses: likewise against the cankers in the gums, and the Squinan∣cy it is profitable to vse it with Hony. For all tumors or swellings in the necke, take equall quantities of this gal, of Goose-grease, and the yolke of an Egge, and these being all ming∣led together let the offended place be rubbed therewith. The same with the iuyce of Cyclamyne and a litle alum looseneth the belly, Marcellus and Wool be∣ing well dipped therein and bound to the Nauell of the belly, expelleth the worms, it cu∣reth the faults in the seat by anointment, it hath also another vertue in it expressed by the Poet in this verse; Languidus antiquo purgatur penis Iaccho. Ac super illi nitur foecundae felle capellae. The melt sod cureth the bloody-flixe, and the bladder burnt and giuen in posset drinke is good for them that cānot containe vrine in their sleepe, Sextus & the secunds of a female goat being drunk in wine of women after their deliuery, Plinius eiecteth & casteth forth their secunds also. The milke is many waies auaileable, for Demcerates the Physitian in the recouery of Confidia the daughter of Seruilius which had beene Consull, vsed the milke of Goats along season which he fed with Lentiles: sea-crabs mixed with this milke, expelleth poyson, and the first milke of a Goat which is milked from her after the weaning of the Kid drunke by him that hath a quartane ague, easeth the fits thereof. And some of the ancient Phisitians gaue as much dunge of swallowes as will lie vpon three groats, Columella mixed with this milke a∣gainst a quartane Ague, and when young lambes were sicke, the shepherds cured them by infusing into their chaps the milke of goates: the powder of Betony drunke out of Goates milke stayeth bleeding. Plinius The holy fire is a disease of sheepe almost incurable, because if any remedy doe but touch them, they fall mad: but they onely in this Malady admit for the recreation or re∣medy goats milke. The roote of the greater Siler decocted in Goats milke; cureth those cold vstions in the flesh or belly, when the place looketh blacke or looseth sence: and Aesculapius taught his followers and patients to drinke it against the ytche, or any biting, and if at any time there be any straine in any member of the body, so that the Article seemeth to decline and loose his former strength and humour, it is recouered againe by binding vnto it lyne-seede sod in Goates milke. Funerius aduiseth to wash the face there∣with that the beauty of it may be more splendant. Take seuen Sea-crabs and being beaten to powder mingle them with one pinte of Goates milke and a cup of Oyle, and so straine them diligently, and infuse them into a Horsses mouth which is sicke of the headache and it shal cure him. The milke also by the counsell of Philistion with the iuyce of Cabages, Salt, and Ho∣ny, is giuen against the shortnesse of breath, and if the right eie of a Chamaelion be pulled out of her aliue, and put into Goats milke, and applyed to the eyes, it cureth the whitnesse of the eies. The fat of a Bull mixed with this milke and infused into the eares, cureth their mattery euils, and causeth them to heare more assuredly and fiermely. The gummes of children annoynted therewith, causeth their teeth to come forth with lesse paine, and it fasteneth the loose teeth by often rubbing: the corners in the throat, and the arteries are deliuered from exulcerations by gargarizing this milke, either warmed at the fire, or else as it com∣meth forth of the vdder. The seede of Cresses decocted in this milke and drunke, Plinyus Marcellus easeth the paines in the sto∣mach, and also purgeth being mixed with salt and Hony. Marcellus prescribeth this ex∣cellent purgation which shall neuer make the party sicke, that is a pinte of Goates milke, two ounces of salt Ammoniacke and one ounce of the best Mecis, beate them altogether and giue them to the patient fasting, Hippocrates and so let him walke a good while till the mdicine be wrought in his body, and if a woman be with child and oppressed with headache or haue an Ague, she may safely take this milke sod with Hony. The Physitians make a speciall drinke of this milke, which they cal Schiston ; it is sod in a new earthen pot, and hath put into it the branches of a fig-tree, and so many cuppes of sweet water, as there were pintes of milke, and when it boyleth, keepe it from seething o∣uer, by putting into it a siluer vessell with colde water, and being taken from the fire, de∣uide it into many vessels till it be cold, so the whay wil part from the milke: and some take the whay and seeth it againe till the third part be onely left, and afterward set it abroad in the Sunne to coole, and this may be safely drunke fiue dayes together (euery day a pint) at fiue seueral times, against the falling euil, melancholy, palsies in Leprosies, gowtes or paines in the Articles, and the sicknesse of the liuer, which is like to a plereusie. Or let him drinke the Goats milke, the third part thereof mingled with hony (as Hippocrates prescri∣beth) or with the seed of Mathrum (as Serenus counselleth) in this verse: —Stomacho medentur Semina Mathrifactae cum lacte capella. A draught of Goats milke sodden with mallowes, and a little salt put to it, represseth the gripings of the belly, Plinius and if you put a little rennet vnto it, it wil be more profitable. Goats milk tempered with rennet, before it be altogether strained, while it is warme, it must be giuen to those that haue the bloodie flix to drinke, and it will helpe them presently: put also to a good potion of sweet Wine mingled with goates milke, Marcellus and a little rennet of a kid (as much as a nut kernell is) which being tempred with the hand, let it be giuen to the patient, laboring with the bloody flix, before it be strained, for the space of three daies. Let this drinke be giuen one that is fasting about the time he riseth, and being boyled, put sufficient Barly flower to it, Marcellus. and being in like manner like pap or pottage, you must giue it to the patient to drinke for the same disease. Goats milke being sodden halfe away, may be giuen to those that haue the bloody flix. If they that be troubled with fretting of the guts, and the flix, are weakened by reason of their often going to the stoole. Plinius The broath of a fat Henne sod with Butter or goats milke, or Sheepes, warmed by it selfe, or else sod with Butter, is very good to be giuen vnto them. Take three ounces of Amylum, Marcellus being a kind of meat, three moneths olde, into as much goats milke sod as you shall thinke fit, and so giue it the patient by svppository meanes for the bloody Flix. Ox∣en, Dioscorides Sheepes, or goats milke, staieth the exulcerations and flowings of the belly, so it bee sod on the coales, after the vse of glisters, if a mans secret inwards do abound with filth, but if not after the foments be laid to the roots and stocke of the yard, fresh goates milke must be applied about the measure Hemian and no lesse, but it must not be done altoge∣ther but a part. The next day let the milke seeth til the one halfe be diminished, still taking away that which is vpermost (I meane the skinne or froth that gathereth in setling) and so vse it. Aeti s. For the risings and flowings of the belly and the flix, it is very good to get cows milke or Goats, as is before mentioned of the Cow. Panicke being sod in goates milke, helpeth the belly, being taken twice a day, and so it is good for the fretting of the guts. Old bread tempered with goates milke, Plnyus being giuen those that haue the fluxe in their belly twice a day, in manner of supping, it is a present helpe. The iuyce of planted pease, soked with goats milke, helpeth the lask of the belly. The melt is good with goates milke, after one hath fasted two daies, let him drinke goats milke, that are fedde with Iuy, without any other kinde of meate, for three daies to∣gither. They that are troubled with the paine of the melt the best remedy is this: let milche goats be kept fasting three daies, and in the thirde day let him eate Iuie onely, and let them bee milked before they drinke, Pliny and let the fasting patient greeued about his melt, take three sextaries Warme of that milke, so soone as she is milked, and so let him drinke it the space of three daies, during which time he shall not eat nor drinke a∣ny other meate, and it shall helpe him maruailously. Marcellus He that hath the consumption of the Spleene, let him drinke the whay of Goats that are fed with Iuy. Goats milke also halfe sodden, so it be of them that feede on Iuy onely, it may bee giuen to children that are troubled with the paine in the melt. A drinke made of Goats milke and rennet put to it (as cheese is acustomed to be made) and giuen to those that haue the Dropsie, Aesculapius they shal be holpen. Also Goats milke killeth the wormes. Sextus. Those that are troubled with the greefe of the reynes, let him take three cups of Creti∣an sod in wine, and so much of Goats milk, and three and thirty grains of Cowcumber∣seed, all wel bruised togither, which hee may drinke at one draught. Anatolius saith, Amitolins. that a porenger full of Goats milke, with as much Amylum, which is as much as three poren∣gers of Sheepes milke, and three ounces of oile, all which well tempered together must be giuen through a horne to a horsse that pisseth blood, and it wil remedy the same: and Polygonius saith, that goates milke and Amylum with three Egges and the iuyce of pellito∣ry, is good for the same disease in horses. Pelagonius. The meale of Bettony soked out of Goats milk stayeth the blood dropping out of the paps. Pliny. Phisitians do drink certaine medicines made of goats milke that increase Venus. Marcellus. The men of Thessalia drinke another roote of a certaine hearbe (called Orchim ) beeing softer and nothing inferior with Goats milke to stirre vp men to carnall copulation, and they drinke the harder kind of roote so tempered to stay it. The roote Ragwort (as some call it) being giuen to women with childe, it maketh them that they cannot conceiue, be∣ing of watery condition: against which Goats milke soked with honey, is an excellent re∣medy. If the hinder parts that are somewhat fleshy stand further out then the rest, and open, Sextus annoint them with Goates milke warmed. If any mans Sheepe be sicke, Innominatus let him take Goates milke mingled with Wine, and so let him giue it them to drinke. If Lambes bee troubled with Agues or sicknesse, let goates milke bee giuen them thorough a horne. Cheese made of goates milke is an excellent helpe for those that haue drunke Misel∣den. Collumella For other bitings of beasts (besides that of a madde Dogge) goates cheese wel dri∣ed with wilde Margerom must be drunk. The same also is excellent against the sting∣ing of Serpentes; For all other bitinges and stinginges of lesser Beastes, it is also a ve∣ry good remedy. Being dryed out of Vineger and Honey, taketh away vlcers and bli∣sters. This same cheese when it is new, so it bee wel pressed and no whay left in it, and mixed with honey, is most excellent against the quartan Ague. Serenus. Goats cheese also represseth all dolors and punctions, and being soft and new, and made with hony, Pliny. and couered with a wollen or linnen cloath, taketh awaie the puffing vp of the flesh. It being dryed with scalli∣ons, you may anoint Saint Antonies fire with it. Being dried out of Hony and Vineger, Aesculapius Pliny (when men do bath) without oile, it may be annointed on blacke wheales. That which is fresh and well riuuated, being laid on the eies, it quicklie aswageth the paine. It is also ex∣ceeding good for the pricking of the eies, the greefe of the head and feete, it is also good for the dropping of the eyes, with a little warme Water applied vnto it, and if it bee a swelling of the eies then out of honey, either of which greefes is to bee kept warme with whay. For the greefe of a mans yard, seeth goates cheese and honey, of a like quantity in a poulteise made in a new earthen pot, and so laid thereunto twice a day, but firste wash the place with old wine that is to be cured. It is good for Carbuncles, and if a woman be sicke of her wombe, and troubled with a Febre, let her take the fift part of halfe a Chaeuix, Pliny. of Pet∣tispurge, and so much nettle seede, and halfe a Chaeuix of goates cheese scraped, being tempered with old wine, and afterward being sodden let her sup it vp, and if she haue the Flix let her drinke the blacke wilde grape, and the rinde of a Pomegranat, and a nutkernel, and the rennet of a Bul, these being washed in blacke wine, goats cheese, and wheat-flower put them together. Discorides The fime or dung of such females as liue in the Mountaines drunke in wine, cureth the falling euill; and in Galens time they gaue the trindles of Goats in Wine against the Iaun∣dise, and with the fime they annoynt them that haue the fluxe, and made into a poltesse is very helpfull against the Collicke: but Marcellus prepareth it on this manner: first it must be steeped in water and strained, with sixty graines of pepper, and three porringers of sweet water, and so deuide it into three equal potions to be drunke, in three seueral daies: but the body of the patient must be first washed or annointed with Acopus, so as all per∣frictions by sweate may be auoyded. Aetius against the hardnesse of the Spleene prescribeth a plaister made of Goats dung, barly meale, and the dung alone against all tumours or swellings of the melt. Against wa∣ter lying betwixt the skinne, and the skinne and the flesh this is prepared many waies, and first against the Dropsie, Archigenes they seeth it in the vrine of a Boy which hath tasted of poyson, or in the Goates vrine, till it be as thicke that it will sticke and cleaue, and it will purge all by the belly, and also the shauings of hides which Corriers make, sod in vineger with Goates dung is accounted in England a singular medicine to represse all hydropick swel∣ling in the legs and belly. The fime of Female-goates drunke in sweete water expelleth the stone out of the blad∣der. Plinea Against the paine in the hippes, the Arabians prescribe it in this manner, which they call adustion (betwixt the thumbe and the hand) there is a hollow place wherein they put Wooll diped in Oyle; afterward they set on fire little piles of Goates dung in the same Wooll, and there let it burne till the fume and vapour thereof be sensibly felt in the hip∣bone: some vse to apply this to the fat, but in our time it is all out of vse, and yet seeing the paines of the hip doe rather fall into the thighes, shinnes and Legges, then assend vp into the Armes and shoulders, Aetius and Cornarius saye, that this adustion for the hips was vsed in the auncient time diuers waies, and some on this manner, holding the burning dung in a paire of tonges vnto the leg of that side where the paine lieth, vntill the adustion be felt in the hip, and this course vsed Dioscorides. Quintillius vsed another way, which was this: he first of all heate the Goates dung, and therewithall burned the soft and fleshy part of the great toe, neare vnto the Naile, vntill it pierced to the sicke place; after such vstians, they lay beaten leaues of leekes with salt to the place, but in the hard bodies of country men invred to labour, they apply the dung of goats with barly meale and vineger. The same with Saffron and Goates sewet, applied to the gowt, healeth it, or else mu∣sterdseede, stalkes of Iuy, Bittony, or the flower of Wilde cowcumber, the same drunke with spikneard, or other spice, stirreth vp a womans flowers, and causeth easie deliue∣rance, but being beaten into meale and vineger and layed to a womans belly, with wooll and Frankcumcense, stayeth all fluxes and Issues: also little bals of the same with haires and the fat of a Sea-calfe wrought altogether and perfumed vnder a woman, hath the same effect, or else the Lyuer of a Sea-calfe and the shauings of Ceder wood. Pliny affirmeth, that the midwiues of his time staied the greatest fluxe of the belly by drinking the vrine of a Goat, and afterwardes anoynting it with the dung of a Horse that hath bruised his hoofe. Vegetius Anatolius Goats blood with vineger cureth the same, and if an Apletree haue worms in it, the dung of a Goate and the vrine of a man laied to the root driue them away. The vrine of Goates blood drunke with vineger, resisteth the stinging of Serpents, and also being laid to bunches and swellings in the flesh, in what part soeuer they be, it disper∣seth and expelleth them. Against the stifnesse of the Necke which they call Opisthotonos, Take vrine of a Goate and the heades of scallions bruzed to iuyce, and infuse them into the eares; and the same mingled with the oyle of roses and a little Nytre, cureth the paine in the eares by infusion, or by the smoke perfumed in a Goats horne twenty dayes toge∣ther. Against naturall deafenesse take the horne of a Goate newly slaine, and fill it with the vrine and hang it vp nine daies in the smoke, Gallus and afterwards vse it. The vrine of a goate made warme, and instilled into the eares, and the fime annoynted with fat is good for the vaines of the throat. For the Dropsie drinke one spooenfull mingled with Cardus, and warme it at the fire, also mingled with wine or water, it expelleth the stone in the blad∣der, according to the saying of Serenns : Nec non obscaenus caprae: potabitur humor Obruat hic morbum tabefact aque saxa remittit. The same Physitian prescribed Goats trindles to be drunke in wine against the Iandis, and to stay the fluxes of women, the same dung tied in a cloath about vnquiet children, e∣specially women-kind, maketh them more still, being mingled with wine, cureth the bi∣tings of vipers, and the dung taken out of the Goats belly and annointed vpon the sore, cureth it with all speede: the same vertue it hath to heale men wounded by Scorpions, being decocted in Vineger it cureth also the biting of a mad Dog, mixed with honey and wine. Being laid vpon a wound it keepeth it from swelling, it hath the same vertue mingled with Barley-meale, but healeth the kings euill, It is vsed also to ripen sores and ruptures, being applyed to the suppurations, it keepeth downe the swellings of womens brests, be∣ing first dried and then steeped in new wine, and so laide to the sore, for it disgesteth in∣flamation. When the eyelids be thicke, hard, red, and bald, take goats dung and Mouse dung, of eyther a like quantity burned, and twice so much of the powder of the Graecian canes with honey Atticke, and anoint them therewith; being heate with Vineger and put vpon the sore it cureth Tetters and Ring wormes, and disperseth Carbuncles in the belly: also being heated in Vineger with cow milke, oile of Cipres and Laurell, it purgeth and cu∣reth al wounds of the legs and shins, it pulleth out thorns or sharp pricks out of the body, as that learned Physitian Mytiae hath proued, as sheepes dung also doeth: laying it round about the wound it cureth burnings and draweth out heat, with oile of roses and Vineger (as Gallen writeth.) It is also commended for broken ioynts, because it suffereth them not to swell or start out being once set, therefore it must be vsed with Honey and wine, and it hath the same ope∣ration for broken ribbes, for it openeth, draweth and healeth: also it being decocted with Vineger, it healeth the paines in the nerues although they be ready to rot, and easeth the paine in the ioynts: the fime of a fat Goat cureth the gout, and the contraction or shrin∣king of the nerues; being dressed with Vineger and made as thick as Hony, it helpeth the trembling members. It is verie dry, and therefore ( Arnoldus saith) it cureth the Fistula, making a plaister thereof with the meale of Beanes, Wine and Leigh, which hath beene seene wonderfully to drie vp the Fistula. With Oxymel and Vineger it cureth the Aleptius but it must be burned. Take seauen bals of Goats dung, worke them in Vineger, then anoint your forehead therewith, and it easeth the paine in the head, or else mingle it with oile of roses, and spred it vpon a cloath laying it to your Temples, change it morning and euening, and you shal find great ease thereby. If the eies be swolne at any time, bind this dung vnto them: being mingled with Li∣quid pitch, and honey, healeth them which are sicke of the Quinansie, being gargarized in the mouth, he which is sicke of an olde Cough, let him take the dryed trindles and put them into the best wine, and drinke it off, so shall he presently auoid his fleame and filthy humor and be healed. The remedies out of a wilde Goat. The same vertue which are in the Goats before spoken of, do also belong to the wilde Goats, the blood taketh away bunches in the flesh, and being mingled with Sea-palme, causeth the hair to fall off. An ointment made of the fat of Goates, is profitable to them which haue webs in their eies, and the fat of mountaine Goats, helpeth infected Lightes: His liuer broiled vpon coales and taken alone, helpeth the Flix, but most certainely when it is dried and drunke in wine: the gawle is good for many things, especially it is a Trea∣cle against poison, suffusions, whitnesse and blindnesse of the eies, by annointing, it cu∣reth the purblind and the webs in the eie, and generally it hath the same properties in e∣uery part as the tame goats before spoken of. The like may be said of the Kyds or young goats, and first of all a Kyd being slit assun∣der aliue, and his warme flesh laide to a poisoned wound, doeth most assuredly heale the same. Others take the warm flesh of kyds and perfume them with hair, by the sauor where∣of they driue away Serpents: the skinne newly pulled off, and put vppon the body beaten with stripes, taketh away their paine: others againe vse it against the Crampe, and not without reason, for the tender skinnes of Lambes and Goates, being sprinkled or dip∣ped in Warme Oyle, giueth very much strength and patience, to endure the convul∣tion. Praxagoras prescribeth the flesh against the falling euil, and by gargarizing the broath when it was sod, cureth the Quinsie and sorenesse of the throat. Demetrius saith, that the braine being drawne thorough a gold ring and giuen to a Hawke which hath the fallinge sicknes, it will worke admirably vpon her. The blood being dried and decocted with mar∣row, is good against all intoxicat passions and being mingled with sharpe Vineger before it be congealed, it helpeth the spitting of blood: the same being eaten, cureth all kinde of Flixes, being taken three daies together. Gallen rehearseth in the Antidot of Vrbane, a∣mong other things the blood of Kyds to draw the deade young ones out of the dammes belly. With the fatte there is an ointment made with rose water, to heale the fissures of the lippes and nose, which is much desired of women, not onely for the before rehearsed vir∣tue, but also because by annointing they keepe by it their face from Sunne-burning. The French and Italians call it ( Pomato ) because it smelleth like Apples, they put also into it muske and Rose-water, a pound of kyds sewet, and warme it in a Bath vntill all bee white, and so wash it with the saide rose water, and afterward repose it in a glasse: The ointment which is caled ( Vnguentum album ) is like vnto it: the ashes of the thighes of a kyd, healeth burstnes and stancheth blood: the rennet is also commendable against Hemlocke, or toad-stoole, and against al the poisonfull strokes of Sea-beasts; Being drunke in Wine it stayeth bleeding, and refresheth excreations of bloode; being taken with Vineger it hel∣peth also the flix, being drunk fasting, it hath some operation to stay womens flowers. The lights of a kydde sod and eaten fasting, preserueth from drunkennesse that day, and the powder of it burned, easeth the itching of the eies, and pield eyelids, if it be applyed like Stibium : likewise the bladder of a female kyd drunke in powder, helpeth the inconstancy of vrine: the melt laide vppon the Spleene of an infant asswageth the paine and tumors thereof; the liuer is not fit for temperate men, but for weake colliricke men. The inhabitants of the mount Atlas do gather Euforbium, and corrupt it with Kyddes milke, but it is discerned by fire; for the good Euforbium being burned, yeeldeth an vn∣acceptable sauor, and so we conclude this storie, with the two Emblems of Altiatus. One against them that take much paine and make good beginninges but euell endes, like a goat which giueth a good messe of milke and ouerturneth it with hir foot: Quod fine egregios turpi muculaueris orsus Innoxamque tuum verteris officium Fecisti quod Capra sui mulctraria lactis Cum ferit & proprias calce pro fundit opes. The other Emblem is vpon a Goat, the which by her keeper was constrained to giue a young wolfe suck, who afterward notwithstanding that good turn, deuoureth his nurse: and it maie be applied vnto them which nourish their owne harmes, and saue a theef from the gallowes. Capra lupum non sponte meo nunc vbere lacto Quod male pastoris prouida cura iubet Ceruerit ille simul mea me post vbere pascit Improbitas nullo flectitur obsequio. There is a prettie comparison of a Harlottes loue to a fisherman which putteth vpon him a goats skin with the hornes, to deceiue the Sargus -fish, for that fish loueth a goat aboue all other creatures, and therefore the fisher-man beguileth her with a false appearance, as the flattering loue of Harlots do simple minds by fained protestations. OF THE GVLON. THis beast was not known by the ancients, but hath bin since dis∣couered in the Northern parts of the world, and because of the great vorasity thereof, it is called ( Gulo ) that is, a deuourer in imitation of the Germans, who call such deuouring creatures Vilsruss, and the Swedians, Cerff, in Lituania and Muscouia, it is called Rossomokal. It is thought to be engendered by a Hyaena & a Lionesse, for in quality it resembleth a Hyaena, Mathias & it is the same which is called ( Cro∣cuta :) it is a deuouring and an vnpro∣fitable creature, hauing sharper teeth then other creatures. Some thinke it is deriued of a wolfe and a dog, for it is about the bignesse of a dog: it hath the face of a Cat, the body and taile of a Foxe; being black of colour: his feet and nailes be most sharp, his skin rusty, the haire very sharp, and it fee∣deth vpon dead carkases. When it hath found a dead carkas he eateth thereof so violently, that his belly standeth out like a bell; then seeketh he some narrow passage betwixt two trees, and there draweth through his body, by pressing wher∣of, he driueth out the meate which he had eaten: and being so emptied returneth and de∣uoureth as much as he did before, and goeth again & emptyeth himselfe as in former ma∣ner; and so continueth eating and emptying til al be eaten. It may bee that God hath or∣dained such a creature in those countries, to expresse the abhominable gluttony, of the men of that countrie, that they may know their true deformed nature, and liuely vgly fi∣gure, represented in this monster-eating-beast: for it is the fashion of the Noble men in those parts, to sit from noone till midnight, eating and drinking, and neuer rise from the table, but to disgorge their stomacks, or ease their bellies: and then return with refreshed appetites to iugurgitate and consume more of Gods creatures: wherin they grow to such a highth of beastlinesse, that they loose both sence and reason, and know no difference be∣tweene head and taile. Such they are in Muscouia, in Lituania, and most shamefull of al in Tartaria. These things are reported by Olaus Magnus, and Mathias Michou ; But I would to God that this same (more then beastly intemporate gluttony) had beene circumscribed and confined within the limets of those vnchristian or hereticall-apostaticall-countries, and had not spred it selfe and infected our more ciuell and christian partes of the World; so should not nobility, society, amity, good fellowship, neighborhood, and honesty, be euer placed vpon drunken or gluttonous companions: or any man be comended for bibbing and sucking in wine and beere like a swine: When in the meane season no sparke of grace, or christianity, appeareth in them: which notwithstanding they take vppon them, being heerein worse then beastes, who stil reserue the notes of their nature, and preserue their liues; but these, loose the markes of humanity, reason, memory and sence, with the con∣dicions of their families, applying themselues to consume both patrimony and pence in this voracity, and forget the Badges of christians, offering sacrifice to nothing but their bellies. The church forsaketh them, the spirit accurseth them, the ciuell world abhorreth them, the Lord condemneth them, the diuill expecteth them, and the fire of hell it selfe is prepared for them, and all such deuourers of Gods good creatures, to helpe, &c. To helpe their disgestion, for although the Hiena and Gulon, and some other monsters are subiect to this gluttonie, yet are ther many creatures more in the world, who although they be beastes and lacke reason, yet can they not by any famine, stripes, or prouocations be drawne to exceede their naturall appetites, or measure in eating or drinking. There are of these beastes two kindes, The kinds of Gulons. distinguished by coulour, one blacke, and the other like a Wolfe, they seldome kill a man or any liue beastes, but feede vpon carrion and dead car∣kasses, as is before saide, yet sometimes when they are hungry, they prey vpon beastes, as horses and such like, and then they subtlely ascend vp into a tree, and when they see a beast vnder the same, they leape downe vpon him and destroy him. A Beare is afraid to meete them, and vnable to match them, by reason of their sharpe teeth. This beast is tamed, and nourished, in the courts of Princes, for no other cause then for an example of incredible voracitie. When he hath filled his belly, if he can find no trees growing so neare together, as by sliding betwixte them, hee may expell his excre∣ments, then taketh he an Alder-tree, and with his forefeete rendeth the same asunder, and passeth through the middest of it, for the cause aforesaid. When they are wilde, men kill them with bowes and guns, for no other cause than for their skins which are pretious and profitable, for they are white spotted, changeably interlined like diuers flowers, for which cause the greatest princes, and richest nobles vse them in garments in the Winter time: The skinnes of Gulons. such are the kinges of Polonia, Sweue-land, Goatland, and the princes of Germany, neither is there any skinne which will sooner take a colour, or more constantly retaine it. The outward appearance of the saide skinne is like to adamaskt garment, and besides this outward part there is no other memorable thing woorthy obseruation in this rauenous beast, and therefore in Germany it is called a foure-footed Vulture. OF THE GORGON, or strange Lybian Beast. A Mong the manifold and diuers sorts of Beasts which are bred in Affricke, it is thought that the Gorgon is brought foorth in that countrey. It is a feareful and terrible beast to behold, it hath high and thicke eie-lids, The country and descrip∣tion. eies not very great, but much like an Oxes or Bugils, but all fiery-bloudy, which neyther looke directly forwarde, nor yet vpwards, but continuallye downe to the earth, and therefore are called in Greeke Cato∣bleponta. From the crowne of their head downe to their nose they haue a long hanging mane, which maketh them to look fearefully. It eateth dea ly and poysonfull hearbs, and if at any time he see a Bull or other creature whereof he is afraid, he presently causeth his mane to stand vpright, and being so lifted vp, opening his lips, and gaping wide, sendeth forth of his throat a certaine sharpe and horrible breath, which infecteth and poysoneth the air aboue his head, so that all liuing creatures which draw in the breath of that aire are gree∣uously afflicted thereby, loosing both voyce and sight, they fall into leathall and deadly convulsions. It is bred in Hesperia and Lybia. The Poets haue a fiction that the Gorgones were the Daughters of Medusa and Phorcy∣nis, Aelianus and are called Steingo, and by Hesiodus Stheno, and Euryale inhabiting the Gorgadian Ilands in the Aethiopick Ocean, ouer against the gardens of Hesperia. Medusa is said to haue the haires of his head to be liuing Serpentes, against whom Perseus fought and cut off his hed, for which cause he was placed in heauen on the North side of the Zodiacke aboue the Waggon, and on the left hand holding the Gorgons head. The truth is that there were certain Amozonian women in Affricke diuers from the Scithians, against whom Perseus made Warre, and the captaine of those women was called Medusa, whom Perseus ouer∣threw and cut off her head, and from thence came the Poets fiction discribing it with Snakes growing out of it as is aforesaid. These Gorgons are bred in that countrey, and haue such haire about their heads as not onely exceedeth all other beastes, but also poy∣soneth when he standeth vpright. Pliny calleth this beast Catablepon, because it continually looketh downeward, and saith that all the parts of it are but smal excepting the head which is very heauy, and exceedeth the proportion of his body which is neuer lifted vp, but all liuing creatures die that see his eies. By which there ariseth a question whether the poison which he sendeth foorth, proceede from his breath or from his eyes. Wherupon it is more probable, that like the Cockatrice he killeth by seeing, then by the breath of his mouth which is not competible to any other beasts in the world. Besides when the Souldiors of Marias followed Iugurtha, they sawe one of these Gorgons, and supposing it was some sheepe, bending the head continually to the earth, and mouing slowly, they set vpon him with their swordes, whereat the Beast disdaining suddenly discouered his eies, setting his haire vpright at the sight whereof the Souldiors fel downe dead. Marius hearing thereof sent other souldiers to kill the beaste, but they likewise died as the former. At last the inhabitauntes of the countrey, tolde the Captaine the poyson of this beasts nature, and that if he were not killed vpon a sodaine with the onely sight of his eies, he sent death into his hunters: then did the Captaine lay an ambush of souldiers for him, who slew him so dainely with their speares and brought him to the Emperour; whereupon Marius sent his skinne to Rome, which was hung vp in the Temple of Hercules, wherein the people were feasted after the triumphes; by which it is apparant that they kill with their eies and not with their breath. So that the fable of Seruius which reporteth that in the furthest place of Atlas these Gorgons are bredde, and that they haue but one eie a peece, is not to be belieued, excepte he meane, as elsewhere he confesseth, that there were certaine maides which were sisters called Gorgons, and were so beautyfull that all young men were amazed to beholde them. Whereupon it was saide, that they were turned into stones: meaning that their loue bereft them of their witte and sence. They were called the daughters of Cetus, and three of them were made Nimphes, which were called Pephredo, Enyo, and the third Dinon, so called a Geraldus saith: because they were olde women so soone as they were borne, whereunto was assigned one eie and one tooth. But to omit these fables, it is certaine that sharpe poi∣soned sightes are called Gorgon Blepen, and therefore we will followe the authority of Pliny and Atheneus. It is a beast all set ouer with scales like a Dragon, hauing no haire except on his head, great teeth like Swine, hauing wings to flie, and hands to handle, Hyginus. in stature be∣twixt a Bull and a Calfe. There be Ilandes called Gorgonies, wherein these monster- Gorgons were bredde, and vnto the daies of Pliny, the people of that countrey retained some part of their prodigious nature, it is reported by Xenophon, that Hanno King of Carthage ranged with his armie in that region, and founde there certaine women of incredible swiftnesse and perniscitie of foote. Whereof he tooke two onely of all that appeared in sight, which had such roughe and sharp bodies, as neuer before were seene. Wherefore when they were dead, he hung vp their skinnes in the Temple of Iuno, for a monument of their straunge natures, which remained there vntill the destruction of Carthage. By the consideration of this beast there appeareth one manifest argument of the creators deuine wisdome and prouidence, who hath turned the eies of this beaste downeward to the earth, as it were thereby burying his poyson from the hurt of man: and shaddowing them with rough, long, and strong haire, that their poysoned beames should not reflect vpwards, vntill the beast were prouoked by feare or danger, the heauines of his head being like a clogge to restraine the liberty of his poysonfull nature, but what other partes, vertues, or vices, are contained in the compasse of this monster, God onely knoweth, who peraduenture hath permitted it to liue vppon the face of the earth, for no other cause but to be a punnishment and scourge vnto man∣kind: and an euident example of his owne wrathfull power to euerlasting destruction. And thus much may serue for a discription of this beast, vntill by gods prouidence, more can be knowne thereof. OF THE HARE. A Hare is a four-footed beast of the earth, which the Haebrews call Arnebet, in the feminine gender, which word gaue occa∣sion to an opinion that all Hares were females, or at the least that the males bring forth young as well as females: whereof we shall see more in the sequell of this story. And the Iewes say that it signifieth nothing else in Haebrew but a Hare, for which word Deut. 14. the Chaldee translateth Arneba, the Arabians Ernab, the Persians Kargos. Anicenna caleth it Arne∣beti, Siluaticus, Of the seue∣ral name. Arnoberi, Arnebus, and Arnaben ; the Sara∣cens Arneph, the Graecians Leporis, Lagoos, Lagos, Lagooos, because of his immoderat lust. It is called Ptox for his feare, and in Latine Lepus, of Leui∣pes, signifieng swiftnesse of feete, and that it is not heard when it goeth, howsoeuer some men deriue it from Leporis the Greeke word, others deriue Lagos from La, betokening e∣uelation, and Oos signifieng an eare, because she pricketh vp one of her eares when shee runneth. The Italians call it Lieuora, the French Licure, and Leurauh, Leureteau, the Spani∣ards Hebre, the Germans Hass, or Haas, the Illyrians Zagitz. Of the seue∣ral kinds. There be foure sorts of Hares, some liue in the mountaines, some in the fields, some in the marishes, and some euery where without any certaine place of abode. They of the mountains are most swift, they of the fields lesse nimble, they of the marshes most slow, & the wandring Hares are most daungerous to follow: for they are so cunning in the wayes, and muses of the field, running vp the hils and rockes, because by custome they know the nearest way, and forbearing downe hills, sometime making heads vpon the plain ground, to the confusion of the Dogs, and the dismaying of the hunter. Of the Ely∣an Hares. Pollux saith, that there be certaine Hares called Elymaei (almost as big as Foxes) being blackish, of long bodies, and large white spots vpon the toppe of their tailes; these are so called of their countrey (like the Elymaean Dogs.) There be also Hares called Moschiae, so called because of their sweet smell, or else that they leaue in their footsteps such a strong sauour, Hermolaus. whereunto when the Dogges smell, they are said to be almost mad. At Pisa the Hares be very great, because there they haue more gratefull meate than in other places. A secret in the Mulchi∣an Hares. Niphus. O the con∣try Hare, & their seuerall parts. In the neather Pannonia they are much fatter and better tasted than they be in Italy, the Italian Hare hath his fore-legs low, a part of his backe pale or yellowish, the belly white, the eares long: In Gallia beyond the Alpes, they are also white, and therefore some haue thought that in the winter time they eate snow: and this is certaine, that when the snowe melteth, their colour is much altered. There hath beene white haired Conies whose skin was blacke, and haire of their eares blacke. They are bred in Libia, in Scithia, and in Italy, in the top of the mountaines, and so brought into other countries. Some againe haue bin white in the Winter, and returne to their former colour in Summer. There are great store of white conies in Vilna, Bonarus. and Lethuanya, but they are lesser esteemed, and sold cheaper. ( Schenebergerus saith) the backe of a Hare is commonly russet, or like oliue colour interli∣ned with some blacke spots: the common Hare of the Alpes neuer changeth colour, and it is greater than the ordinary Hare. There are white Hares also in England, and in Musco∣uia, there are a multitude of Hares of all colours, but no where so many as in the desert I∣slands, because there are no Foxes there to kill the young ones, or Eagles which frequent the highest mountaines in the continent, and the people that inhabit there regarde not hunting. In Athens (Maucrates saith) there were no Hares, but Alseus affirmeth the contrary. Hares brought into Ithaca die presently, The Hares of Ithaca. and if they raunge a little about the countrey, yet re∣turne they backe to the hauen where they came to lande, and depart not from the shore til they be dead. Hegesander Delphus writeth, that in the raign of Antigonus, there was such a number of Hares in Astipalea (and afterward in Leros ) that the inhabitants were constrai∣ned to go to the Oracle, and demaund counsell how to resist the hares, from whom they receiued answeare, that they must nourish Dogges and kill them, and whereas they so a∣bounded in Leros, which at the peoples owne request and care multiplyed to their great harme, afterward a signe of the hare was placed in heauen, to remember them that no∣thing so much hurteth mankind, as their owne desires, yet in auncient time there was not a hare in those countries. In the next place we are to describe all the parts and members of hares, for it is admi∣rable to behold how euery limbe and part of this beast is composed for celerity: Their seueral parts. and first of all the head is round, nimble, short, and of conuenient longitude, prone to turn euery way; the cares longe and lofty like an Asses, for nature hath so prouided, that euery fearefull and vnarmed creature should haue long and large ears, that by hearing it might preuent his enemies, and saue it selfe by flight. The lippes continually moue sleeping and waking, and from the slit which they haue in the middle of their nose, commeth the term of hare-lips, which are so deuided in men; for if a woman with childe see one of them so∣dainly, it is dangerous if the child proue not hair-lipt. They haue also teeth on both sides. Whatsoeuer beast be borne in your flocke, hauing that marke vpon them, which is commonly called hares-tooth, neuer suffer them to sucke their dam, but cast them aware as vnprofitable and Bastard cattell; the necke of a hare is long, small, round, soft, and flexi∣ble, the shoulder-bone straight and broad, for her more easie turning, her legges before soft and sound, standing a little asunder very flexible, broder behind then before, and the hinder legges longer then the former, a breast not narrowe, but fitted to take breath in course, a nimble backe and fleshy belly, tender loines, hollow sides, fat buttockes filled vp, comely, strong and neruy loines, the forefeet very flexible, onely it wanteth a com∣modious taile for course. The eies are browne, it is a subtil beast, but not bold, Of their se∣veral sences it sildome looketh forward, because it goeth by iumpes. The eie-lids comming from the brows, are too short to couer their eies, and therefore this sence is very weake in them, and besides their ouermuch sleepe, their feare of Dogges and swiftnesse, causeth them to see the lesse; when they Watch they shut their eies, and when they sleep they open them. A secret. Wherefore the Egyptians when they will signifie and open a manifest matter, they picture a hare sleeping. They watch for the most part all the night: when the eye-lid of a man is pulled backe, so as it will not couer the ball of the eye. The Graecians call it La∣gophthalmous, that is: hares eies, for so doeth Coelius define it: it commeth sometimes, Orus when in the cure it is cut away too much, or else when the hinder lid falleth downe, and standeth not vp to meet the other, but concerning the colour of their eies, it is not very possible to discouer it, as wel for the causes aforesaid, as also because it is sieldome taken but dead, yet this is certaine, that with what colour it beginneth, in that it continueth to the last, according to Virgils verses. Quem fuga non rapit ore Canum, non occulit vmbra Concolor immotum sub Ioue terra tegit. The liuer is so parted assunder, that a man would thinke there were two liuers in one bo∣dy, and Pliny is bold to affirme, that in Briletum, Thirne, Propontis, Sycynum, Bolba, and o∣ther places they are al such. Whether males beare yong like fe∣males. Archelaus vppon this occasion affirmeth, that a hare beareth young both male and female, so that the Gramarians know not of what sex to make it. Al∣bertus and Democritus are absolute in this point. Blondus confesseth he cannot tell, the common sort of people suppose, they are one yeare male, and another female. Aelianus also affirmeth so much, and by relation of his friend, he ventereth the matter, and saith moreouer, that a male hare was once found al∣most dead, whose belly being opened, there were three young ones aliue taken out of hir bellie, and that one of them looked vp aliue, after it had lyen a while in the Sunne, and it put out the tongue as though it desired meat, whereupon milke was brought to it, and so it was nourished. But al this is easily answered, if a man follow the counsell of Archadius, and looke vpon the secrets of nature, he shal finde a most plaine distinction: but the hunters obiect that there be some which are onely females and no more: but no male that is not also a fe∣male, and so they make him an Hermaphrodyte. Niphus also affirmeth so much, for he saw a Hare which had stones and a yard, and yet was great with young, and also another which wanted stones, and the males genitall, and also had young in her bellye. Rondeleius saith, that they are not stones, but certaine little bladders filled with matter, which men find in female-Hares with young, such as are vpon the belly of a Beuer, wherein also the vulgar sort are deceiued, taking those bunches for stones, as they do these bladders. And the vse of these parts both in Beuers and Hares is this; that against raine both one and other se suck therout a certaine humor, and annoint their bodies all ouer therewith, and so are de∣fended in time of raine. The belly of a Sow, a Bitch, and a Hare, haue many cels in them, because they bring forth many at a time, when a hare lyeth downe, she bendeth her hin∣der legs vnder her loines, as all rough-footed-beasts do. They are deceiued which deliuer by authority of holy Scriptures that hares loue to lodge them vpon rocks, but we haue manifested else-where, that those places are to bee vnderstood of Conies. They haue fore-knowledge both of wind and weather, Summer and Winter by their noses, Aelianus Their nature and dispositi∣on. for in the Winter they make their formes in the Sun-shine, because they canot abide frost and cold, and in the Summer they rest toward the North, remaining in some higher ground where they receiue colder ayre. We haue shewed already that their sight is dimm, but yet heerin it is true that Plutarch saith, they haue Visum indefessum, an indefattigable sence of seeing, so that the continu∣ance in a meane degree, counteruaileth in them the want of excellency. Their hearing is most pregnant, for the Egyptians when they signifie hearing picture a hare, and for this cause we haue shewed you already that their eares are long like hornes, their voyce is a whyning voice, and therefore Authors call it Vagitum, as they doe a yong childs, accor∣to the verse of Ouid : Intus aut infanti Vagiat ore Puer. They rest in the day time, Their time of sleep & food and walk abroad to feed in the night, neuer feeding near home, either because they are delighted with forren foode, or else because they woulde exercise their legs in going, or else by secret instinct of nature, to conceale their forms and lodging places vnknowne, their hart and blood is colde, which Albertus assigneth for a cause of their night-feeding: they eat also grapes, and when they are ouercome with heat, they eat of an herbe called Lactuca Leporina, and of the Romaines and Hetrurians, Ciserbita, of the Venetians, Aelianus. Lactucinos, of the French Lacterones, that is, hares Lettuce, hares house, hares pallace, and there is no disease in this beast the cure whereof she doth not seeke for in this hearbe. Hares are said to chew the cud in the holy Scripture, they neuer drinke, but con∣tent themselues with the dew, and for that cause they often fal rotten. It is reported by Phi∣llippus Belot, that when a hare drunke Wine shee instantly died, they render their Vrine backwardes, and their milke is as thicke as a Swines, and of all creatures they haue milke in vdders before they deliuer their young. They are verie exceedingly giuen to sleepe, because they neuer winke perfectly: some authors deriue their name Lagon in Greeke, from Laein to see, and thereupon the Graecians haue a common prouerbe Lagos Catheudon, a sleeping Hare for a disembling and counterfetting person, because the Hare seeth when shee sleepeth, for this is an admirable and rare Worke of nature, that all the residewe of her bodilye partes take their rest, but the eye standeth continually sentinell. Of their co∣pulation and engendring. Hares admit copulation backe∣warde, and heerein they are like to Connies, because they breede euery moneth for the most part, and that many; at that time the female prouoking the male to carnal copulati∣on, and while they haue yong ones in their belly they admit copulation, whereby it com∣meth to passe that they do not litter al at a time, but many daies asunder, bringing forth one perfect, and another bald without haire, but al blind like other clouen-footed-beasts. It is reported that twoe Hares brought into the Isle Carpathus, filled that Iland with such aboundance, that in short time they destroyed al the fruites, whereuppon came the pro∣uerbe Carpathius Leporem, to signifie them which plow and sow their owne miseries. It falleth out by deuine prouidence, that Hares and other fearefull beasts which are good for meat, shall multiply to greater numbers in short space, because they are naked and vnarmed, lying open to the violence of men and beasts, but the cruell and malignant creatures which liue only vpon the deuouring of their inferiours, as the Lyons, Wolues, Foxes, and Beares, conceiue but verie seldome, because there is lesse vse for them in the world, and God in his creatures keepeth downe the cruell and rauenous, but aduanceth the simple, weake, and despised: when the female hath littered her young ones, she firste licketh them with her tongue, and afterwards seeketh out the male for copulation. Hares do sildome wax tame, and yet they are amongst them, Hares sildom tamed. which are neither Placi∣dae nor Faerae, tame nor wilde, but middle betwixt both, and Cardane giueth this reason of their vntamable nature, because they are perswaded that all men are their enemies. Scali∣ger writeth, that he saw a tame Hare in the castle of Mount- Pesal, An example of a tame hare. whoe with her hinder legges would come and strike the Dogges of her owne accord, as it were defieng their force, and prouoking them to follow her. Therefore for their meate they may be tamed and accustomed to the hand of man, but they remaine vncapable of al discipline and ig∣norant of their teachers voice, so as they can neuer be brought to be obedient to the call and command of their teacher, neither will go nor come at his pleasure. It is a simple creature, hauing no defence but to run away, yet it is subtile, as may apear by changing of her forme, and by scraping out her footsteps when shee leapeth into her forme, that so she may deceiue her hunters, Aelianus. also she keepeth not her young ones togither in one litter, but layeth them a furlong one from another, that so she may not loose them altogether, if peraduenture men or beastes light vppon them. The subtility of hares. Neither is she carefull to feede her selfe alone, but also to be defended against her enemies, the Eagle, the Hawke, The defence of the hare a¦gainst her e∣nemies. the Fox, and the Wolfe, for she feareth all these naturally, neither can there be any peace made betwixt her and them, but she rather trusteth the scratching brambles, the solitarie woods, the ditches and corners of rockes or hedges, the bodies of hollow trees, and such like places, then a dissembling peace with her aduersaries. The wilde Hawke when she taketh a Hare, she setteth one of her talants in the earth, and with the other holdeth her prey, striuing and wrastling with the beast vntil she haue pulled out his eies, and then killeth him. The Foxes also compasse the poor Hare by cunning, Albertus for in the night time when he falleth into her foot-steps, he restraineth his breth, and holdeth in his sauor, going forward by little and little, vntil he find the form of the Hare, and then thinking to surprize her, on a suddaine leapeth at her to catch her, but the watchfull Hare doth not take sleepe after a carelesse manner, delighting rather in suspition than security, when she pereciueth the approaching of such a guest, (for she windeth him with her No∣strils) and thinketh it better to goe from home, than make a feast to her foe. Wherefore she leapeth out of her forme and runneth away with all speed she can. The Foxe also followeth but a farre off, and she hearing her aduersarie no more, betaketh her selfe to rest againe, vnder some bramble or other bush, supposing that the ground shee hath gotten shal neuer be recouered of her againe: but the prouerbe is old and true, faire and softly goeth far, so the Fox which seldome getteth meat but winneth it with his wit & his heels, foloweth as fast as he cā, for a slow pace ouertaketh the hare at rest, which whē she perceiueth, forth shee goeth againe, forsaking her quiet sleepe, for the sauegarde of her life, & hauing gone so much ground as she did before, she betaketh her to rest the second time, hoping that now shee hath quit her selfe from her foe; but the Foxes belly hath no eares, and therefore hunger is to him like a thousand whips, or a whole kennel of hounds, forceing him forward after his game. The hare for her better sauegard getteth vp into some smal tree, being sleepy and wea∣ry through the Foxes pursute; the Fox commeth to the tree and shaketh it by the rootes, and wil not suffer the hare to take any rest, for he hopeth that time and trauel wil bring hir to his dish, she leapes away againe, and letteth no grasse grow vnder his feet, hoping that her heeles shal deliuer her from the Foxes teeth: After followes the Fox, and at length (as the greater pursse ouer waigheth the smaller, and the great horsse of Warre ouerwearieth the little hunting nag,) so doth the lusty limbes of the Fox, outlast the weake legges of the hare, and when she can go no more, needes must her weakenes betray her to hir foe, and so was hir flight and want of rest like a sicknesse before her death, and the Foxes presence like the voice of a passing bell. Aelianus. And on the contrary, all the labour of the Foxe, like a gentle and kinde exercise for the preparing of his stomacke to such a feast. The fift and least kind of Wolues are also e∣nemies to hares, and the Weasill do craftily sport and play with the hare vntill he haue wearied him, and then hangeth fast vpon her throat, and will not loose her holde, rume the hare neuer so fast, till at last through want of breath and losse of blood, she falleth into the hands of her cruel play-fellow, who turneth sport into good earnest, & taketh nothing from her but her blood, leauing her carcasse to be deuoured by the hands of others, and in this manner is the seely hare hunted by beastes: Now let vs heare how she is hunted of men. The hunting of hares. It is before expressed, that euery limbe of a hare is composed for celerity, and there∣fore she neuer trauelleth but iumpeth, her eares lead her the way in her chase, for with one of them she harkeneth to the voice of the dogges, and the other she stretcheth forth like a saile to hasten her course, alwaies stretching her hinder-feet beyond her former, and yet not hindering them at all, but sometimes when her ardent desire maketh her straine to fly from the dogges, she falleth into the nettes, for such is the state of the miserable, that while they runne from one perill, they fal into another; according to the saying of holy Scripture, Esay 24. He that scapeth out of the snare, shall fall into the ditch. And this is to be noted, that if the hare had the wit to runne forth right, and neuer to turne, she could not be so easily ouertaken, but because of her loue to the place of her breed, there she is taken and looseth her life where she had her beginning: for she preferreth that place aboue all other for safty. Againe some of the elder hares, assoone as they heare the Dogges, flye to the toppes of the high mountaines, for they more easily runne vppe the hill, then downe. Wherefore the hunter must studiously auoid that disaduantage, and keepe her down in the vallies. In paths and hygh waies shee runneth more speedily, wherefore they must be kept from that also. The hares of the mountaines do oftentimes exercise themselues in the plaine, and through practise grow acquainted with the nearest waies to their own lod∣ging; so that if at any time the husbandmen set vpon them in the fieldes, they dally with them till they seeme to be almost taken, and then on a suddain take the nearest way to the mountains, not suspected by the hunters, and so take sanctuary in the vnaccessible places, whether dogs nor horse dare ascend. For the hares which keep in the bushes are not able to indure labour, and not very swift (by reason of the paine in their feet) growing fatte tho∣rough idlenes and discontinuance of running, they must be hunted on this sort: first of al they go through young woods and hedges, such as grow not very thicke, for the thicker hedges they leape ouer, but when they come to many thicke places that they must leape ouer, they quickely fall downe and are tired. The dogs first of all go from them carelessely, because they cannot see them through the trees, but suffer them to run in the woods following a farr off by the scent, vntill at last they get the sight of her, and then through their better exercise and skill, easily ouer take her: but the campestriall or fielde-hare being leaner of body and oftner chased, is taken with more difficultie, by reason of her singular agility, she therfore when she begins her course leapeth vp from the ground as if she flew, afterward passeth through brambles and thicke bushes with al expedition, and if at any time she come into deepe grasse or corne she easilie deliuereth her selfe and slideth thorough it. And as it is saide of the Lyons, that with their tailes they stirre vp their strength and courage, so are the eares of this beast like Angels wings, ships sailes, and rowing Oares, to helpe her in her flight; for when she run∣neth, she bendeth them backward and vseth them insteed of sharpe spurs to prick forward her dulnes, & in hir course she taketh not one way, but maketh heades like laborinthes to to circumvent and trouble the dogs, that so she may go whether she wil, alwaies holding vppe one eare, and bending it at her pleasure to be the moderator of her chase. Neither is she so vnprouident or prodigall of her strength, as to spend it al in one course, but ob∣serueth the force of her prosecutor, who if he be slow and sluggish, shee is not profuse of her celerity, but onely walketh gently before the Dogges, and yet safely from their clow∣ches, reseruing her greatest strength to her greatest necessity, for she knoweth that shee can out-runne the Dogges when she pleaseth, and therefore it is a vaine conceit to trou∣ble her selfe more then she is vrged. But if there be a Dogge following her more swiftly then the residew, then she setteth forward with all the force shee can, and when she hath left both hunters and Dogs a great way behind her, she getteth to some little hill or rising of the earth, there she raiseth her selfe vpon her hinder legges, like a Watch-man in his Tower, obseruing how farre or neare the enemy approacheth, and perceuing that shee is deliuered from pursuit of all daunger, seemeth to deride the imbecillitie of their for∣ces. The younger hares by reason of their weake members, tread heauier vppon the earth then the elder, and therefore leaue the greater sauour behind them: and in ancient time if the Hunters had taken a young Leuerit, they let her go againe in the honour of Diana. At a yeare old they runne very swift, and their sauour is stronger in the woods then in the plaine fields. The Hare is followed by the foote and so discryed, especially in soft grounds or high waies, but if they go to the rocks, to the mountains, or to the hollow places, they are more vncertaine, if they lie down vpon the earth (as they loue to do) in red fallow grounds, they are easily descryed. When they are started in the plaine fields they run far, but in the Woods they make short courses: If they heare the Dogges, they raise themselues on their legges and runne from them, but if fearefull immagination oppresse them, as they oftentimes are very sad and melancholy, supposing to heare the noise of Dogges where there are none such sturring, then doe they runne too and fro, fearing and trembling, as if they were fal∣len mad. Their footsteps in the Winter time are more apparant then in the Summer, because as the nights be longer, so they trauell farther: neither do they smell in the winter Mor∣nings so soone as it is day vntill the frost and yce be thawed, but especially their footsteps are vncertaine in the full moone, for then they leape and play together scattring and put∣ting out the sauour, nor in the spring time also when they do ingender, they confound one anothers footsteps by multitude. They which will goe foorth to hunt or take pleasure in that pastime, must rise earely, least they be depriued of the smell of her foote-steps, so shall not the dogges be able any waie to find the Hare, nor the hunters their game and pastime: for the nature of the foot∣step remaineth not long, but suddenly in a manner vanisheth awaie euerie houre. Againe, they must set the hils and rockes, the riuers, and also the brooks with nets and gins, there∣by as it were stopping vp the starting holes, paths, and waies, wherein the hare for the most part trusteth, whether they be broad or narrow: The best time for the effecting & bringing heereof is after the Sunne rising, and not in twy light or breake of the day, least the nett s be set neare the Hares forme, and she be scar ed away, but if they be set a farre off, there is no daunger of her departure after the Sunne is vp, because then shee giueth her selfe to sleepe: the nets must be set on this manner, let the rodes bee pitched vpright, fastning their snares to the tops, raising the net in the middle, and hange a long stone at one side, that when the Hare is in the net she may not go out againe. When the Hare is raised, hee which followeth her to the nets, must driue her in with great cry, and being in the net, he must gently restraine the Dogs, and make signification to the hunter that she is taken, or else if it faile, let him shew the contrary. The keeper of the nets must keepe silence, least by hearing of his voice she be auerted, and the hunter must take the Dogs and go to the forme, there to start the Hare; and the fashion was in auntient time among the Pagans, first of all to call vpon Apollo and Diana, (their immagined Goddes of hunting) to speede their sport, to whome they promised part of their game. But when the dog is sent forth, and after much winding and casting a∣bout, falleth into the footsteppe of the Hare, then let him loose another, and seeing them runne in one course, vncouple all the houndes, let him follow after, speaking to his dogs by name, saying nowe A, then B. Hoika C. and such like Words of Art, not pressing them too eagerly at the beginning, but gentlie encoraging them to the pursuit. The Dogs take this for a signe of ioy, and being glad to gratifie their maisters, run along with gallant cry, turning ouer the doubtful footsteps, now one way, then another, like the cuts of Indentures, through rough and plain, crooked and straight, direct and compasse, wagging of their tailes, and glistering with their eies, vntil they find the Hares form: then they make signification thereof to the hunter with their tailes, voices, and paces; nowe running together, now standing stil deuided asunder, they set vpon the beast, who sudain∣ly riseth, and turnes the cry of the hounds after hir flight, then must the hunters cry out: Io Dogs, there boies, there Io, A, Io, B, Io, C, and the shortest word is fittest to applawde the Dogs. Let the hunter also runne after, so as he neuer meet the Hare and trouble the hounds, the poore Hare gets her out of sight, and runs to the place where she was first started, but if she fall into the nets by the way, the keeper of the nets must giue token to the hunters by his hollowing voice, after the vsuall manner of woodmen: O Oha, O ohe, that the game is at an end, and then call the Dogs by name: If the Hare run farre, and stand long on foot, and if the dogs passe ouer the Hares footsteps and discry them not, then must the hunter recal them with a peculiar hunting terme, and lead them to the place, or casting about it as neare as he can, rebuking the Dogges that range at vncertainties, and exhorting them that be diligent; who when they haue found the footings againe, run on as before, with al alacrity. In the mean season let the hunter stand still til the dogs do infalliably demonstrat vnto him that they haue found the game againe, then let the hunter proceede as before, exhorting his dogs to the sport, and if it last al day, the hunter must regard that he restrain and keepe the Dogges to the wearyed Hare, least if they start a fresh one, their labour be lost. If it be in Summer about noone, let him rest his dogges for strengthning of their feete till the heat be ouer; if it be snowy weather, and the winde set Northerly, the foote∣steps remaine long and are not easely melted, but if the South winde blowe, the foote steps are very quickly shortened: and neither when the snowe falleth fast, or the winde bloweth strong, must the Dogges be ledde foorth to hunting, for the snow burneth the Dogges noses, and the frost killeth the heat of the Hares foot; then let the hunter take his nets and some other companion with him, and go to the woodes or mountaines, tracing out the foot-steps of the beast in the snow vnto the forme, which is in some steep or sha∣dowed place, where the windes blow ouer the snow, for in such places doth the Hare seek her lodging; hauing found it, let him not come too neare, least he raise her from hir seat, but cast round about, and if he find no footings from that place, he may take it for graun∣ted, that the Hare is found. Hauing so done, let him leaue her, and seeke another before the snow be melt, and the footings dashed, hauing respect to the time of the day, that so he may inclose and take them before the euening: then let him draw his nets round about them, compasing the whole plat wherein shee resteth, and then raise her from her stoole: if she auoide the net, he must follow her by the foot vnto her next lodging place, which will not be far off, if he follow her close, for the snow doth weary her and clot vpon her hinder feet, so as the hun∣ter may take her with his hand, or kil her with his staffe. Blondus showeth another way of taking Hares: The hunters spread and deuide them∣selues by the vntilled and rough wais, leading a Grey-hound in a slip, beating the bushes, hedges, and thornes, and many times sending before them a quicke smelling Hound, which raiseth the Hare out of her muse, and then let goe the Grey-hound with hunting terms and cryes, exhorting him to follow the game; and many times the Dogs teare the Hare into many pieces, but the hunters must pull them bleeding from the mouth of their Dogs. Others againe lie in waite behinde Bushes and trees to take the Hare on a sudden, and some in the vineyards, for when they are fat & resty, they are easily ouertaken, especially in the cold of winter. Cyrus (as appeareth in Zenophon ) was taught to make ditches for the trapping of Hares in their course, and the Eagles and Hawkes watch the Hare when she is raised and hunted by the houndes, and set vpon her on the right side, whereby they kill and take her, so that it is true which was said at the beginning, that Hares are hunted by men and beasts. Hauing thus discoursed of hunting and taking of hares, Of parks and warrens of Hares. now it followeth also in a word or two to discourse of Parkes or inclosed Warrens, wherein Hares, Conies, Deere, Boares, and other such beastes may alwaies bee ready, as it were out of a store-house or seminary to serue the pleasure and vse of their maisters. Grapaldus saith, that the first Ro∣man that euer inclosed wilde beasts, was Fuluius Herpinus, and Gillius saith that Varro had the first warren of Hares: the manner was (saith Columella ) that Richmen possessed of whole Towns and Lordships, neare some village, inclosed a peece of land by paile, mud∣wall, or bushe, storing the same with diuers wilde beastes, and such a one there was in the Lordship that Varro bought of Marcus Piso in Tusculanum: and Quintus Hortentius saw at Lawretum a wood inclosed, containing fifty Akers, wherein were nourished all sortes of wild beasts, within the compasse of a wall. Quintus Althea commanded his forester to call the beastes together before him and his guestes sitting at supper, and instantly he founded his pipe, at the voice whereof there as∣sembled together a great company of all sorts, to the admiration of the beholders. Quin∣tus Fuluius had a Parke in Tarquinium, wherein were included not onely all the beastes be∣fore spoken off, but also wilde sheepe, and this contained forty Akers of ground: besides he had two other. Pompaeius erected a Parke in France, containing the compasse of three thousand paces, wherein hee preserued not onely Deere, Hares, and Connies, but also Dor-mise, Bees, and other beastes; the manner whereof ought to be thus; first that the walles or pales be high, or close iointed, so as neither Badgers, nor Cattes may creepe through, or Wolues, or Foxes, may leape ouer: Wherein ought also to be bushes, and broad trees for to couer the beastes against heate and cold, and other secret places to con∣tent their natures, and to defend them from Eagles and other rauening foules: In which, three or foure couple of Hares do quickly multiply into a great warren. It is also good to sowe Guoards, Miseline, Corne, Barly, Peies, and such like, wherein Hares delight and will thereby quickly waxe fat. For their fatting, the hunters vse another deuice, they put waxe into their eares, and so make them deafe, then turne them into the place where they should feed, where being freed from the feare of sounds (because they want hearing) they grow fat before other of their kind. Concerning the vse of their skins, in some countries they make sleeues and breeches of them, especially lynings for all outward colde diseases. The civil vse of their seue∣rall parts. Heliogabalus lay vpon a bed filled with flew or wooll of Hares, for then that, there is nothing more soft, for which cause the Grecians made spunges thereof, to clense the eies of men. The Goldsmithes vse the feete or Legges of Hares in steed of brushes or broomes, to take off the dust from their plate. The flesh of hares hath euer beene accounted a delicate meate (among all other foure-footed-beastes) as the Thrush among the foules of the aire, according to the saying of Martiall: Inter aues Turdus si quis me iudice certet Inter quadrupedes gloria prima lepus. In auncient time (as Coelius saith) the Brittons were forbidden to eate Hares, like as the Iewes by the law of Moses, Leu. 11. Deut. 14. Plutarch inquireth the reason whye the Iewes worship swine and Hares because they did not eate their flesh: whereunto an∣swer was made, that they abstained from Hares, because their colour, eares, and eies, were like asses; wherein the ignorance of Gods law appeared, for they abstained from Hares at Gods commandement, because they were not clouen-footed, for the Egyptians accounted all swift creatures to be partakers of diuinity. Their flesh ingendereth thicke blood, therefore it is to bee prescribed for a dry diet, for it bindeth the belly, procureth vrine, and helpeth the paine in the bowels: but yet it is not good for an ordinary diet, it is hot and dry in the second degree, and therefore it nourisheth but little being so hard, as Gallen witnesseth. The blood is farre more whot then the flesh, it is thinne, and therefore watery like the blood of all fearefull beasts; The bloud & flesh eaten the hinder parts from the loines are most delicate meate, cal∣led in Latine Pulpamentum, it was wont to be dressed with salt, & Coriander seed, yet the forepart is the sweeter, for the manner of the dressing whereof I leaue to euery mans hu∣mour. It was once beleeued that the eating of the hinder loines of a hare would make one faire or procure beauty, wherupon Martiall receiued a hare from Gellia a friend of his with this message: For mosus septem Marce diebus eris. And he retorted the iest in this manner vpon Gellia ; Si me non fallis si verum (lux mea) dicis Edisti nunquam Gellia tu leporem. Lampridius writeth that a certaine Poet played vpon Alexander Seuerus the Emperor for eating▪ hares fleshe, which made him faire, whereas in truth hee was very black; In this manner; Pulchrum quod vides esse nostrum regem Quem Syrum suum detulit propago Venatus facit, & lepus comesus Ex quo continuum capit leporem. The Emperor seeing those verses, for Emperors hauing long eares and hands, made an∣swer vnto them as followeth; Pulchrum quod put as esse vestrum regem Vulgari, (miserande) de fabella. Si verum putas esse non rascor Tantum tu comedas velim lepusculos Vt fias animi malis repulsis Pulcher, ne inuideas liuore mentis. If any man finde fault with the Emperors verses, Erasmus hath already answered the ob∣iection, that Kings and Emperors are not subiect to lawes of versesieng, besides his aun∣swer was in Greeke and this is but translated. The eating of hares procureth sleepe, and thus much for the flesh and parts. The E∣pethites of a Hare expressing their natures are, The epithits of Hares Eared, trusting their feet, feareful, careful, fruitefull, flying, raging, vnhorned, little, crafty, tender, sharp-smelling, swift, whining, and wandering, beside many other Greeke names. When Xerxes gathered his Army to goe against Graecia, Stories of monstrous Hares. a man brought forth a Hare which fore-shewed that great Armye should worke no strange effect. And another mare of three yeare old broght forth a hare which spake as soone as it was littered, biting her mother with her teeth, and killing her and while they looked vpon her, sucking her dams blood, fethers grew out of her backe in fashion of wings, which being done the moster lifting vp the voice, spake in this manner; Fundite iam lachrymas & suspiria miseri mortales, ego hinc abeo: that is to say, O ye wretched mortall men weepe and sigh I go away: at which words she flew away and was neuer seene more. There were present at the sight heereof seuen publike notaries, which called witnesses and made instruments thereupon, (as Antonius Bautius writeth in his Epistle to Petrus Toletus of Lyons in the yeare 1537. In December:) whereunto the saide Toletus made this answer, The daies shall come (saith he) except the mercy of God preuent them, that children shall thinke they doe obedience to their parents if they put them to death. They shall grieue because they were borne, and say they are adulterate, as the Hare that was borne of the Maire. Likewise it is reported by Lisander, that when the Corinthi∣ans refused the conduct of the Lacedemonians, and the Lacedemonians besiedging the Cit∣ty, fell to be very much afraid, and vnwilling to scale the walles; whiles they stood in this amaze, suddenly a Hare leaped out of the towne ditch; which thing when Lisander saw, he exhorted his Souldiers, saying; Be not afraid (O ye Spartanes ) of this sluggish and vnex∣ercised people, for you see they stirre not out of the citty, but suffer Hares to lodge vn∣der their Walles; whereupon came the prouerbe ( Dormire lepores submoenibus ) Hares sleepe vnder their Walles, to signifie a slothfull, secure, sluggish, idle, and vnthrifty people. The Eagles of Norway lay their younge ones in Hares skinnes, which themselues pull off. There is also a bird in Scithia, about the bignesse of a Bustard, which bringeth forth two at a time, and keepeth them in a Hares skinne which she hangeth vpon a bough Hares were dedicated to loue, because ( Xenophon saith) there is no man that seeth a Hare but he remembred what he hath loued. They say the citty Bocas of Laconia was builded by a signe of good fortune taken from a Hare, for when the inhabitants were driuen out of their countrey they went to the Ora∣cle to desire a place to dwell in, from whom they receiued answer, that Diana should shew them a dwelling place: they going out of their countrey a hare met with them which they consented to follow, and there to build where the Hare should lodge, and they followed her to a myrtle tree, where the hare hid her selfe, in which place they builded their citty, and euer afterwards retained with veneration a myrtle tree. Pausanius And thus I will conclude this morrall discourse of hares, with that Epigram of Martiall made vpon occasion of a hare that in sport passed through the mouth and teeth of a tame Lyon, saying that she was am∣bitious in offering her life to the Lyons teeth in this wise: Non facit ad saeuos cernix nisi prima leones Scilicet a magnis ad te descendere tauris Desperanda tibi est ingentis gloria fati Quid fugis hos dentes ambitiose lepus Et quae non cernunt frangere colla velint Non potes hoc tenuis praeda sub hoste mori. The powder of a hare with oyle of mirtle, dryueth away paine in the head, and the same burned cureth the cough: the powder thereof is good for the stone in the bladder: The medi∣cins of Hares Pliny. also the blood and fime of a hare burnt in a raw pot to powder, afterwards drunke fasting with Wine and warme water, it cureth the stone: and Sextus saith, hee made triall of it by put∣ting a spoonefull of the powder into Water wherein was a sand stone, and the same stone did instantly melt and disolue: so likewise a young hare cut out of the dams belly and burnt to powder, hath the same operation. A wastcoat made of hare skins straighten the bodies of young and old: also the same dipped in oyle laide to the sore places of a horsses Legges where the skinne is off by ouer reatching, it often cureth the sore: the blood taken warme out of the body amendeth Sunne burning, freckles, pimples, and many other faultes in skinne and face; which Celsus prescribeth to bee doone first by washing the place many houres together, in the morning with the blood, and afterwardes annoynting it with oile: the same vertue is in the fat of swannes mingled with oyle, according to the saying of Se∣renus : Cygnaeos adipes hilari miserto lyaeo, Omne malum propere maculoso ex ore fugabis Sanguine vel leporis morbus delabitur omnis. It also cureth and taketh away the thicke skin of the eie, it adorneth the skinne, produceth haire in able places, and easeth the gout. Or no cutim, perduco pilos & sedo podagrani Sanguine si fuerint membra perunctameo. It being fried, helpeth the bloody-flixe, vlcers in the bowels, an old laske, and taketh away the poyson of an arrow: It being annointed vpon a whot outward vlcer it ripeneth it. Af∣ter a bath, it cureth a great leprosie by washing. The rennet of a Hare staieth loosenesse, the flesh is profitable for vlcers in the bowels, it breaketh the stone being beaten, and be∣ing decocted like a Fox easeth the gout and the shrinking vp of the sinnewes. The fat with the flowers of beanes beaten together, draweth thornes out of the flesh; If naile sticke in the sole of the foote beat together the fat of a hare and a rawe sea-crab, then lay it to the place and right against it vpon the same foote lay also two or three beane flowers, and let it lie a day and a night and so it shal be cured: and the same draweth a poisoned arrow out of a Horsse. Andreas reporteth to Gesner that he hath often heard that the sewet of a Hare layed to the crowne of a womans head, expelleth her secunds, and a dead child out of the wombe. The powder made of this wool or haire stauncheth bleeding, if the haires be pul∣led off from a liue Hare, and stopped into the nose. The powder of the wooll of a Hare burned, mingled with the oyle of Mirtles, the gal of a Bull, and Allum warmed at the fire and annoint it vppon the heade, fasteneth the haire from falling off: also the same powder decocted with Hony, helpeth the paine in the bo∣wels, although they be broken: being taken in a round ball the quantity of a beane toge∣ther; but these medicines must be vsed euery day. Arnoldus prescribeth the haire to be cut short and so to be taken into the body against burstnesse: A perfume made of the dung and haires of a Hare, and the fat of a sea-calfe, draweth forth womens flowers. The seede of a wilde Cowcumber, and an Oyster shell burned, and put into Wine, mingled with the haire of a Hare, and wooll of a sheep, with the flower of roses, cureth inflamations of womens secrets after their child-birth. Also Hipocrates prescribeth the shel of a Cuttle-fish to be beaten into wine and layed in sheeps wooll and Hares haire, helpeth the falling downe of the wombe of a woman with child. If a mans feete be scorched with cold, the powder of a Hares Wooll is a remedy for it. The head of a Hare burned and mingled with fat of Beares and vineger, causeth haire to come where it is fallen off, and Gallen saith that some haue vsed the whole body of a hare so bur∣ned and mingled for the foresaid cure, being layed in manner of a plaister. By eating of a hares head the trembling of the Nerues and the losse of motion and sence in the members receiueth singuler remedy. These thinges also preserueth teeth from aking: the powder of a hares head burned with salt mingled together, rubbed vpon the teeth or if ye will put thereunto the whitest fennell, and the dryed beanes of a Cutle fish. The Indians burne together the hares head and mice for this purpose. When ones mouth smelleth strong this powder with spicknard asswageth the smell. The braine is good against poison. The heart of a Hare hath in yt a theriacall vertue also. The braine is pro∣ued to haue power in it for comforting and reparing the memory. The same sod and ea∣ten helpeth tremblings which hapeneth in the accessions of sicknesse, such as one is in the cold shaking fit of an Ague: It is to bee noted, that all trembling hath his originall cause from the infirmitie or weakenesse of the Nerues, as is apparant in olde age, although the immediat causes may be some cold constitution, as aboundance of cold humors, drinking of cold drink, and such like; all which tremblings are cured by eating the braine of a hare roasted, (saith Dioscorides and Egineta. ) It also helpeth children to breed teeth easily, if the gummes be rubbed therewith, for it hath the same power against inflamation, that hony and Butter hath: being drunke in wine and the stones thereof rosted and eaten, it is good for him which hath any paine in his bladder, Serenus. and if the vrine exceede ordinary, for stay∣ing thereof take the braine heereof to be drunke in wine. The tooth of a hare layed to that part where the teeth ake, easeth them. Take the mawe with the dung in it, Rasis and wash it in old wine so as the dung may mingle therewith, and then giue it to one sicke of the bloody flixe, and it shal cure him. The rennet hath the same ver∣tue that is in a Calues or Kyds, and whereas Nicander praiseth it in the first place, for the vertue it hath in it against poyson, Nicoon an ancient Phisitian giueth it the second place, Aristotle. Gallen for it is full of sharpe digesting power, and therefore hath a drying quality. It dissolueth the congealed and coagulated milke in the belly, and also clotted blood within in the sto∣mach more effectually, then the rennet of any other beast, being alway the better for the age. Being mingled with vineger, it is drunke against poyson, Dioscorides and also if a man or Beast bee annoynted with it, no Serpent, Scorpion, Spider, or wilde Mouse, whose teeth are veno∣mous will venter to sting the body so annointed or else inwardly take thereof three spoon∣fuls with wine against the said bitings, or of any Sea-fish or Hemlocke after the wound re∣ceiued, and with vineger it is soueraigne against all poison of Chamaeleons, or the blood of Bulles. The same being drunke in vineger or applyed outwardly to womens breasts, disper∣seth the coagulated milke in them: also being mingled with Snailes, or any other shelfish, which feede vpon greene herbes or leaues, it draweth forth Thornes, Dartes, Arrowes, or Reedes out of the belly: or mingled with gum of Franckincense, Oyle, bird-lime, Marcellus. and Bees-glew, of each an equall quantity with vineger, it stauncheth blood and all yssues of blood flowing out of the belly: and it also ripeneth an old sore, according to the saying of Serenus ; Si inducas leporis asper sa coagula vino. Being layed to the kings euill in Lint with vineger, it disperseth and cureth it: also it hea∣leth Cankers, it cureth a quartan Ague, also mixed with Wine and drunke with vineger, against the falling euill and the stone in the bladder: If it bee mixed with Sagapanum and Wine Amyney, and infused into the eares, giueth help, as also the paine of the teeth. It dissolueth blood in the lights, and easeth the paine of blood congealed in your stomacke: Dioscorides when one spiteth blood, if he drinke Samia and Mirtle wine, with the rennet of a hare, it shal giue him very present ease. The later learned Physitians take a drinke made of vineger and Water, and giue it warme to eiect and expell blood out of the Lightes, and if any drop thereof cleaue in the bowels, then doe they three or foure times together iterate this potion, and after apply and minister all binding astringent medicines and emplasters, and for the bloody-flix it is good to be vsed: It is held also profitable by Dioscorides and other the ancients, that if the pap or brest of a Woman bee annointed therewith, it stayeth the sucking infantes loose∣nesse of the belly, or else giuen to the child with Wine, or (if it haue an Ague) with Wa∣ter. There is saith Aristotle in the rennet a fiery quality▪ but not in the highest degree, for as fire dissolueth and discerneth, so doth this in milke distinguish the ayery part from the wa∣tery, and the watery from the earthye: Wherefore when one tasteth an olde rennet, he shall thinke hee tasteth an old putrified Cheese, but as leauen is to bread, which hardneth ioyneth, and seasoneth the same, so is rennet to Cheese; and therfore both of them haue the same qualityes of dissoluing and binding: Galen affirmeth that he cured one of gow∣ty tumours and swellings, by applying thereunto olde and strong putrified cheese beaten in a morter, and mixed with the salted fatte or leg of a Swine. If a man sicke of the bloo∣dy-flixe drinke thereof in a reere egge two scruples for three daies together fasting, it will procure him remedy. For pacifieng the Collicke, drinke the rennet of a Hare: the same mingled with Goose grease, stayeth the incontinensie of vrine, it also retaineth womens flowers. If it be drunk with vineger it helpeth the secunds, and being applied with Saffron and the iuyce of leeks, driueth a dead child out of the wombe. If it be drunke three or foure daies together after child-birth it causeth barrennesse. There are (saith Pliny ) a kind of Wormes which being bound to women before the sunne rysing in a harts skin, cause them that they cannot con∣ceiue: this power is called Afocion. Masarius saith, that if a Woman drinke this rennet to her meate before she conceiue with child, she shall be deliuered of a Male child: and such is the foolish opinion of them which affirme at this day, that if men eate parsly or white buds of blacke yuie, it maketh them vnable to carnall copulation. Aetuis The rennet of a Hare easeth and disperseth al tumors and swellings in womens breasts, the Lights of a Hare powdred with salt, with Franckinsens, and white Wine, helpeth him that is vexed with the falling sicknesse, if he receiue it thirty daies together. Sextus ascri∣beth the same remedy to the hart, and Pliny commendeth the Lights to heale the paine in the eies, by binding it vpon the eies. Being drunke in powder, it cureth the secrets. If the heeles be troubled with kybes they are healed with the fat of Beares; but if they bee wrunge with a cold, they are healed with the dust of a Hares haire, or the powder of the Lights; Likewise when the foote is hurt with straight shooes, it hath the same operation. The ancient Magi tooke the skin of an Oxe in powder, with the vrine of Boies, and sprink∣led it on the toes of there feete, binding the heart of a Hare to the hands of him that hath a quartan Ague: and some cure it by hanging the heart of a young hare or Leueret to the necke or arme, Sextus. in the beginning of the fit of him that is so visited. The heart of a hare dri∣ed mixed with Franckincense or Manna in white wine drunke thirty daies together, cureth the falling sicknesse. Pliny. For the paine in the belly take the same medicine, and being drunke with warme water mingled with Samia, cureth the fluxes of women: also if a man that hath the fluxe eat the Liuer of a Hare dipped in sharpe vineger it helpeth him if hee bee Liuer sicke: or if one haue the falling sicknesse, eate the quantity of an ounce thereof, and it helpeth him. The gall of a Hare, the Hart, Lungs, Lights and liuer of a Weasill, mixed together, three drams, one dram of Castoreum, fours drams of Myrrha, a dram of vineger and Hony beat together, Galen. cureth him that hath a swimming or dizzinesse in his brain. The gal newly taken forth mingled with a like portion of hony, and warme in the skinne of an onyon, and so put into the eare, giueth remedy to him that can heare nothing. If he that is sicke in the melt, that is if it be ouer hard, swallow downe the melt of a Hare not touching it with his teeth, or seeing it with his eies, it cureth him. The belly of a hare with the intrals tosted and burned in a frying-pan mixed with oyle, and anointed vpon the head, restoreth decaied haires. The raines of a hare inueterated and drunke in Wine, ex∣pelleth the stone, Auicen and being sod, cut, and dryed in the sun, helpeth the paine in the raines, if it be swallowed downe and not touched with the teeth. The raines of a hare, and of a Moore-henne, cureth them that are poisoned by Spiders, the stones of a hare rosted and drunke in wine, staieth the incontinencie of vrine. In the paine of the loines, and of the hip bones they haue the same operation. The secrets and stones of hares are giuen to men and women to make them apter to copulation and conception, but this opinion hath no other ground beside the foecundity of the beastes that beareth them. They which carry about with them the anckle bone of a hare, shal neuer be pained in the belly (as Pliny saith.) So likewise Sextus and Marcellus. Take the anckle bone out of a liue hare and haires from her belly, there withall make a threed and bind the said bone to him that hath the Collicke, and it shall ease him. The said bone also beaten to powder is reckoned amonge the chiefe remedies against the stone. When women haue hard trauel, put it into Creticke-wine with the liquor of penyroyall, and it procureth speedy deliuery, being bound to the benummed ioynts of a mans legge bringeth great ease: so also do the feete being bruised and drunke in warme wine, relee∣ueth the arteries and shortnesse of breath: and some beleeue that by the foote of a hare cut off aliue, the gout is eased. The fime of a hare cureth scortched members, and whereas it was no small honour to virgins in ancient time, to haue their brestes continually stand out, euery one was prescri∣bed to drinke in wine or such other thinges, nine graines of hares dung: the same drunke in wine at the Euening staieth coughing in the night, in a potion of warme wine it is giuen to them that haue the bloody flix, likewise if a man be sicke of the Collicke, and drink three pieles thereof in sweet wine, it procureth him much ease: being decocted with hony and eaten euery day, the quantity of a beane in desperate cases, mendeth ruptures in the bo∣wels. Asclepiades in his medicine whereby he procured fruitfulnesse to Noble Women, hee gaue them foure drams of Mirrha, two drams of Flower-deluce, two of hares dung, con∣fected with colli iall water, and so put vp into their bellies after ceasing of the flowers, be∣fore they lay with their husbands. Albertus and Raphael prescribe this medicine to help a woman that wanteth milke in her brests, Cristall, white mustard-seed, and Hares dung put into broath made with Fennell. THE HEDG-HOG. Of the kinds of hedghogs. FOrasmuch as there bee two sorts of hedghogs one of the sea, and another of the lād, our purpose in this place is only to dis¦course of the land hedghog, the Hae∣brews cal him Ki∣pod, which in the 14. of Esay, and Zepha. 2. is so tran∣slated by the Sep∣tuagints: The seuerall names. although that some of the Haebrewes woulde haue it to signifie, a rauening byrde, but seeing that I finde the word Ka∣paz in moste Hae∣brewe dictionaries to signifie Claudere and Contrahere, & Contrahere, that is to shut vp & draw together, I doe ra∣ther beleeue that the proper mean∣ing thereof is a hedghog, because this beast so draw∣eth it self togither, when it is in danger as wee shall heare more at large af∣terwardes, accor∣ding to the olde verse: Implici tumque sinu spinosi corporis erem. The Arabians call him Ceufud, or Coufed, the Calde∣ans Caupeda, the Septuagints Mugale. Siluaticus calleth it Agilium, Auicen Aduldu , and Aliherha signifieth a great Mountaine Hedghog: the Grecians Cher, and Acanthonocos, or Echinos, by reason of the prickes vpon his backe. The Latines Echinus, Ericius, Ricius, He∣rix, and Erinatius, the Italians Riccio, and Rizo, the Spaniards Erizo, the Portingals Ouriso, or Orizo, Cache, because of hiding themselues: the French Herison, the Germans Igal, as in lower Germany, in Holland, Een Yseren Vercken in English a Hedghog, or an vrchine: by which name also we call a man that holdeth his Necke in his bosome: the Italians Gess, Malax, Their place of abode. & Illirians Azvuijer Zatho, & Otzischax. So thē for the entrance of this discourse we take it for granted, that Herinatius and Echinus signifie one thing, except one of them sig∣nifie that kind which is like to a Hogge, and the other that kinde which is like to a Dogge, for they differ in place, or in habitation: some of them keepe in the mountaines and in the Woods or hollow trees, The quanti∣tye. and other about Barnes and houses: in the Summer time they keepe neare vineyards and bushy places, and gather fruite, laying it vp against winter. The parts. Hermolaus. It is about the biggnesse of a Cony, but more like to a Hogge, being beset and com∣passed all ouer with sharpe thorney haires, as well on the face as on the feete: and those sharpe prickles are couered with a kind of soft mosse, but when she is angred or gathereth her foode she striketh them vp by an admirable instinct of nature, as sharpe as pinnes or Needles: these are haire at the beginning, but afterwardes grow to be prickles, which is the lesse to be marueiled at, because there bee Mise in Egypt (as Pliny saith) which haue haire like Hedghogs. It hath none of these prickles on the belly, and therefore, when the skin is off, it is in all parts like a Hog. Albertus. His stones are inward and cleaue to his loins like as a birds, he hath two holes vnder his taile, to eiect his excrements, which no creature liuing hath beside him. His meate is Apples, Wormes, or Grapes; When he findeth Apples or Grapes on the earth, hee rowleth himselfe vppon them, vntill he haue filled all his prickles, and then carrieth them home to his den, neuer bearing aboue one in his mouth. And if it fortun that one of them fall off by the way, he likewise shaketh of all the residue, and walloweth vpon them a fresh, vntill they be all setled vpon his backe againe, so foorth hee goeth, making a noyse like a cart wheale. And if hee haue any young ones in his nest, they pull of his load wherewithall he is loaded, eating thereof what they please, and laying vppe the residue for the time to come. When they are nourished at home in houses and brought vp tame, they drinke both Milke and Wine: Their copu∣lation. But there is an Hearbe (called Potomagiton ) whereof if they tast, they die presently. When they are in carnall copulation they stand vpright, and are not ioy∣ned like other beastes, for they imbrace one another, standing belly to belly: but the prickly thornes vppon their backes will not suffer them to haue copulation like Dogges or Swine, and for this cause they are a very little while in copulation, because they cannot stand long together vpon their hinder Legges. When the female is to bring forth her young ones, and feeleth the naturall paine of her deliuery, she pricketh her owne belly, to delay and put of her misery, to her further paine, whereupon came the prouerbe (as Erasmus saith) Echinus Partum Differt, the hedghog putteth of the littering of her young which is also applyed against them which put of and defer those necessary workes, which God and nature hath prouided them to vndergoe; as when a poore man defereth the paiement of his debt, vntill the value and summe grow to be far more great then the principall. heir inward nd di tion The inward disposition of this beast, appeareth to bee very crafty and full of suttlety, by this, because ( Licophron saith) that Nauplius had a cunning crooked wit, and was called by him a Hedghog. When they hide themselues in their den, they haue a naturall vnder∣standing of the turning of the wind, South and North, and they that are norished tame in houses, immediatly before that change remoue from one Wal to another: the wild ones haue two holes in their caue, the one north, thother south, obseruing to stop the mouth a∣gainst the wind, as the skiful mariner to stiere & turne the rudder or sails, for which occasi∣on Aristotle saith, that some haue held opinion, Oppianus. that they do naturally fore-know the chang of weather. There is mortall hatred betwixt the Serpent and the Hedgehog, The enimies to Hedghogs the Serpent seeketh out the Hedghogs den, and falleth vpon her to kill her, the Hedghog draweth it selfe vp together round like a foot-ball, so that nothing appeareth on her but her thorney prickes: whereat the Serpent biteth in vaine, for the more she laboreth to anoy the Hedghog, the more she is wounded and harmeth her selfe, yet notwithstanding the height of her minde, and hate of her heart doth not suffer her to let goe her hold, till one or both parties bee destroyed. The Hehghog rowleth vpon the Serpent piercing his skin and flesh, (yea many times tearing the flesh from the bones) whereby he scapeth aliue and killeth his aduersary, car∣rying the flesh vpon his speares, like an honorable banner won from his aduersary in the field. The Wolfe also is afraid of and flyeth from the Hedghog, and there is also a story of hatred between the Hare and the hedghog, for it is said that a Hare was seene to plucke off the prickles from the Hedghog, and leaue her bald, pieled, and naked, without any de∣fence. The Fox is also an enemy to the poore Hedgehogge, and lieth in waite to kill it, for the prouerbe is true. Multa nouit vulpes, Echinus Vero vnum magnum: That is to say, the Foxe knoweth many deuises: to helpe himselfe, but the Hedgehogge knowes but one great one, for by rowling vp her selfe (as before said) shee opposeth the thornes of her back, against the Foxes teeth: which alone were sufficient to secure her from a greater aduersary; but the wily Fox perceiuing that he can no where fasten his teeth without dan∣ger of himselfe, pisseth vpon the Hedghogs face and poisoneth hir: Wherupon the poor beast is forced to lay open himselfe, and to take breath against the Foxes stincking excre∣ment: which thinge the Foxe espying, looseth no oportunity, but presently teareth the Hedghog in peeces, thus the poore beast auoiding the poyson, falleth into the mouth of his enemy. The manner of Hedgehog is, that whensoeuer they are hunted by men, they draw vp their Legs and put downe there head to the mossy part of there belly, so as nothing of them can be taken but there prickles: and perceiuing that shift wil not serue the turne, but their case growing desperate, they render out of their owne bodies a certain vrine hurtful to their skin and back, enuying that any good thereby should euer come to mankind; and therefore seeing they naturally know the manifold vses of their owne hides, heere is the cunning of her hunting, to cause her first of all to render her vrine, and afterward to take her, for the vrine maketh the thornes of her back to fall off euery day, and therefore they take this course for their last refuge: But in these cases the hunters must poure vppon the Hedghog warme water, for feeling warmth she presently vnfolds her self, and lyeth open which the Hunter must obserue, and instantly take her by one of her hinder Legges, so hanging her vp till she be killed with famine; otherwise there commeth no benefit by her taking. With the same skin flead off brushes, are made for garments, Coelius. The eating of their flesh. so that they complaine il which affirme, that there is no good or profitable condicion comming to mankind by this beast. Againe this is to be resereud and vsed for dressing of flaxe (as Massarius saith) and also it is set vpon a Iaueline at the dore to driue away Dogs. In ancient time they did not eate the flesh of Hedgehogs, but now a daies men eate thereof, (of them which are of the swinish kind.) When the skin is off their bodies, they skald it a little in wine and vine∣ger, afterward lard it and put it vppon a Spitte, and there let it be rosted, and afterwardes eaten, but if the head be not cut off at one blow the flesh is not good. The Epithits belonging to this beast are not many; it is called red, sharp, maryne, vo∣lible, and rough, whereupon Erasmus said, Exhirco in laeuem nunquam mutabis Echinum And thus much for the naturall and morall partes of this Beast. The medici∣nal parts of Hedghogs Now followeth the medicinall. Tenne sprigs of Lawrell, seauen graines of Pepper, and of Opponax as big as a Pease, the skin of the ribs of a Hedghog, dryed and beaten cast into three cups of Water and warmed, so being drunk of one that hath the Collicke, and let rest, he shall in perfect health; A ius but with this exception, that for a man it must bee the membrane of a male Hedgehog, and for a woman a female. The same membrane, or the body of all Hedgehogs burnt to ashes, hath power in it of clensing, digesting, and detracting, and therefore it is vsed by Phisitians for taking downe of proud swelling wounds, and also for the clensing of vlcers and boyles; but spe∣cially the powder of the skinne hath that vertue; also it being rosted with the head, and afterwardes beate vnto powder and annoynted on the head with Hony, cureth the Alo∣pec as. Rasis The same powder restoreth haire vpon a wound if it be mingled with Pitch, and if you adde thereunto Beares-grease, it will restore vnto a bald man his head of haire againe, if the place be rubbed vntill it be ready to bleed. Marcellus The same powder cureth the Fistula, and some mingle red Snailes with this dust, applying it in a plaister to ruptures and swellings in the cods, and being mingled with oile by anointment, it taketh away the burles in the face, and being drunke in wine is a remedy against the paines of the raines or the water be∣twixt the skin and the flesh. Aelianus A suffumigation made of a Hedgehogs skin, vnder them that haue their vrine stopped, by Gods help (saith my Author) the stopping shall be remoued, if it proceede not from the stone, nor from an impostime. The flesh salted, dried, & beat to powder, and so drunk with sweete vineger, helpeth the paine in the raines, the beginning of Dropsies, conuulsi∣ons, and Leprosies, and all those affections which the Graecians cal Cachectae. The Moun∣taine Hedghog is better then the domesticall, hauing prickles like Needles pointes, but Legges like to the other: Dioscorides the meate is of better tast and doth more helpe to the stomack, softning the belly and prouoking the vrine more effectually, and all this which is attribu∣ted to Hedghogs is much more powerfull in the porcupine. The Hedghog salted and eaten is good against the Leprosie, the Crampe, and all sick∣nesse in the Nerues, and Ptisicke and paine in the bellye, rising of windinesse and difficul∣ty of digestion: the powder anointed on Women with child alwaies keepeth them from abortment. Marcellus. The flesh being stale giuen to a madde man, cureth him, and being eaten ke∣peth one from the Strangury; also being drunke in wine, expelleth the stone in the blad∣der, and is good against a quotidian feuer and the bitinges of Serpentes. The fatte of a Hedgehog stayeth the fluxe of the bowels; If the fat with warme water and hony be gar∣garized, Auicen it amendeth a broken and hoarse voice, the left eie being fried with oile, yealdeth a liquor which causeth sleepe, if it bee infused into the eares with a quill. The gall with the braine of a Bat and the milke of a Dog, Albertus. cureth the raines; likewise, the said gall doth not suffer vncomely haires to grow againe vpon the eie-browes, where once they haue bin pul∣led vp. It maketh also a good eie-salue. Warts of al sorts are likewise taken away by the same, the melt sod and eaten with meat, it healeth all paines in the melt, Pliny. and the raines dried are good against a leprosie or ptisicke comming by vlcer, or the difficulty of vrine, the bloody-flixe, and the cough. The dunge of a Hedghog fresh, and Sandaracha with vineger and liquid pitch, being laied to the head, staieth the falling away of the haire. When a man is bitten with a mad dog, or pricked with prickles of a Hedghog, his own vrine laid there vnto with a spunge or Wooll, is the best cure: or if the thornes sticke in the wound of his foote, let him hold it in the warme vrine of a man, and it shall easily shake them forth: and Albertus and Rasis affirme, that if the right eie of a Hedghog be fryed, with the oile of Alderne or line-seed, and put in a vessell of red brasse, and afterward anoint his eies therewith, as with an eie-salue, he shall see as well in the darke as in the light. And thus I will conclude this discourse, with one story that a Hedghog of the earth was dedica∣ted to the Good-god among the foolish Pagans, and the water Hedghog to the euill, and that once in the cittye of Phrigia called Azanium when a great famine troubled the inha∣bitants, and no sacrifice could remoue it, one Euphorbus sacrificed a hedghog, whereupon the famine remoued and he was made priest, and the citty was called Traganos vpon the occasion of that sacrifice. OF THE HORSSE. W Hen I consider the wonderfull worke of God in the creation of this Beast, enduing it with a singular body and Noble spirit, the princi∣pal wherof is a louing and dutifull inclination to the seruice of man. Wherein he neuer faileth in peace nor Warre, being euery way more neare vnto him for labour and trauell: and therefore more deare (the food of man onely excepted:) we must needes account it the most noble and necessary creature of all foure-footed-beasts, before whom no one for multitude and generality of good qualities is to be preferred, compared or equaled, whose commendations shal appeare in the whole discourse following. It is called in Haebrew Sus, & a Mare Susah, The seueral names of hor¦ses. the which word some deriue from Sis signifi∣ing ioy, the Syrians call it Rekesh and Sousias, the Arabians Ranica, and the Caldeans Ra∣makim, Susuatha, the Arabians Bagel, the Persians Asbacha, the Grecians Hippos, and at this day Alogo, the Latines Equus, and Caballus, the Italians and Spaniardes Cauallo, the French Cheuall, the Germans Kossz, the Bohemians Kun, the Illirians Kobyla, the Polo∣nians Konij. It is also profitable to consider the reason of some of these names, both in the Latine & Greek tong: and first of all Equus seemeth to be deriued, Ab aequalitate, from equality, The deriua∣tion of sun∣dry names. because they were first vsed in Charets and draughtes, and were ioyned together being of equall strength, Legs and stature, Caballus seemeth to be deriued from the Greeke word Caballes, which was a common name for ordinary Hackney-horsses, and Horsses of carri∣age, whereupon Seneca commendeth Marcus Cato, that in his triumph of Censorship, Vno Caballo contentum et ne toto quidem, partem enim sarcinae ab vtroque latere dependentes occupabant. That is to say, that he was contented with one Horsse for his own saddlel, and yet not totally one neither, for the packes that hung on either side of him, possessed the greatest part, and the true deriuation of his word, seemeth to accord with Caxe, which sig∣nifieth a manger, and Alis aboundance, because riding Horsses are more plentifully fed, and these Horsses were also vsed for plowing, according to the saying of Horac ; Optat ephippia bos piger optat arace Caballus. The Grecians call it Hippos, which seemes to be deriued from standing vpon his feete, and this beast onely seemeth to be one of the number of them, which are called Armenta. And besides all histories are filled with appellatiue names of horsses, such as these are Alastor, Aethon, Nicteus, and Orneus, the Horsses of Pluto. Aetha a Mare of Agamemnon remembred by Homer. Aethion, Statio, Eous, Phlego, Pyrois : the Horsses of the Sun; Claudian Lam∣pus, Podargus, Xampus, Arnon, the horsses of Erymus : by whose ayde Hercules is saide to ouercome Cygnus, the Sonne of Mars. Balius, Xanthus, and Pedasus, the horsses of Achil∣les, Boristenes, for whom Adrianus made a graue (as Dion writeth) Bromius, Caerus, Calydon, Camphasus, Cnasius, Corythe, and Herpinus, two names of Brittaine horsses cited by Martial and Gillius. Cylarus the swift horsses of Castor, Dimos, and Phobos, the horsses of Mars. En∣riole, Glaucus, and Sthenon, the horsses of Neptune, Parthenia, and Euripha, Mares belong∣ing to the Sentaurs of Hippodamia, slain by Ornomaus. Harpe, another Mare Phoenix, and Corax : the horsses of Eleosthenes. Epidaminus, who wan the prizes in the sixty sixe Olimpi∣ade, and caused a statue to be made in Olympus, and his said horsses and Charriot called Pantarces, and beside these, other Cnacias and Samus. Also Podarces, Rhoebus, Strymon, Tagus, Theron, Thoes, Volneris, which was a horsse of Prasinum, and it is reported that Verus the Emperor so much affected this horsse, that he not onely caused him to be brought into his owne Pallace, and to haue his meate alway giuen in his presence, but made of him a picture with a manger, wherein were Grapes and Corne, from whence came the first Golden horsses or prizes of chiualry; Primus equum volucrem Massyli muuera regis Haud spernenda tulit: Vnto these may be added the affected names of Poets in loue of their fauorites, as Rho∣landus, Vegiantinus, Baiardus, the horsse of Rainaldus, Rubicanus of Argalifas, Hippogrysus of Rugertus, Frontinus and Fratalatus of Sacrapan, and Rondellius of Oliuerius. The Epithits that belong to horsses, are either generall or particular, The epithits of Horsses. the general may be rehearsed in this place, such as these are following: brasse-footed, continuall, horne-footed, sounding-footed, foming, bridle-bearer, neighing, maned, dusty, four-footed, fretting, saddle-bearing, watery, or sweating, whole-footed; and many such others both among the Greekes and Latines, which howsoeuer they may containe diuers Alegories in them, and therefore may seeme to be figuratiuely set downe, yet I thought good be∣ing of other opinion to reckon them heere in the beginning, that so the reader may con∣sider, that I would be vnwilling to omit any thing in this story, which might any way tend to the dignity of the subiect we intreat of, or the expressing of his nature. Wherefore, wee will firste of all beginne with the description of the naturall partes of a good Horsse. The haire of a horsse falleth off euery yeare, the neather eye lid or browe hath no long haires growing vpon it, and therefore Nicon that famous painter of Greece, when hee had most curiously limbed forth a horsses perfection, & faild in no part of nature or art, The naturall outward and inward parts of Horsses. but onely in placing haires vnder his eie, for that onely fault h e receiued a disgracefull blame. The haire of the manes ought to be long, that part which groweth betwixt the eares, vpon the Temples, hanging downe betwixt the eyes, the Graecians tearme Procomion, the Latines Caprona, and in English it may be called a fore-top, which is graunted to horsses not onely for ornament sake, but also for necessitie to defend their eies. Aelianus. The horsses are naturally proud of these lockes and manes, as may appear by those mares which are kept for procreation of mules, by copulation with Asses, which at the first despise to ingen∣der with those shaueling and short haired Stallions. Wherefore their keepers shaue off their manes, and their fore-tops, afterwards leading them to the waters, wherein while the Mares behold their owne deformity, they grow so shamed, deiected, and discouraged, that euer after they admit with quietnesse the Asses to couer them. Therefore it is neuer good to cut the mane or the fetter-lockes except necessity require, for the mane and fore-top is an ornament to the Necke and head, and the fetter lockes to the Legges and feete: and he that keepeth horsses must as well regard to haue them comely for outward grace, as stronge and able for necessary labour. Many vse to cut the Neckes of their riding Horsses euen, as they doe of their drawing Horsses, which thing although it may seeme to be done for greater encrease, and farther groweth of haire, yet is it vnseemely for an honest rider: some againe cut it to stand compasse like a bow, and many vse the Armenian fashion, cutting the mane by rowes, leauing some lon∣ger then other, as it were the batlements of a Church; but the best fashion of all is the Persian cut, whereby the one halfe of the thicknesse is cut away on the left side, and the o∣ther on the right side smoothly turned ouer and combed, according to the saying of Vir∣gill: Densa iuba & dextro iactata recumbit in armo. But if the Horsse be double maned and so the haire fall halfe on the one side, and halfe on the other, then cut all the middle haires away, and leaue both the sides whole: for such was the inuention of the Parthians. In a Coult or young foale the hinder part is hier then the fore part, but as he grows in yeares, so likewise the forepart groweth higher then the hinder. This beast hath two bones in his head, and other two discending from his forehead to the Nostrils, two inferior Gumbes, or Cheeke-bones, forty teeth, that is to say, foure and twenty grynders, foure canyne, and twelue biting teeth; there are seauen crosse ribbes in his Necke, and seuen from his raines to his hole, his taile hath twelue commisures, and two Ragulae in his fore-shoulders, from his shoulders to his Legges other two, from his Legges to his knees two moe, in his knees there are twoo supporters, and from the shin, to the Articles two mo, there are sixteene small bones in the bottome of his hoofe, and but one in his brest, in the inward parts there are six and twenty ribs, from the hinder parts to the top of his reynes, Ʋe etius the two grinding bones; and from them to the hinder part of the head there are two moe, and two little ribbes from the vpper part of the thigh to the Gamba, and from thence to the haire of the pasternes, there are two, and the little ones to the hooues sixteene, so all the bones in number are accounted a hundred and se∣uenty. Now it followeth to declare the measure and number of the members; there are twelue steps or degrees in the roofe of his mouth, his tongue is halfe a foot long, the vp∣per lip hath twelue ounces, the vnder lip fiue, euery one of the cheeks ten: from the fore∣locke to the Nostrils he hath one foot in length, his two eares containe six ounces, and his eies foure ounces a peece. From his fore-locke to the Mercurius, there are contained 8. ynches, the backbone containeth three and thirty crosse ribs. From the conuulsial of the reines, to the top of the taile, are twelue commissures, the length of his Sagula containeth also twelue ounces, from his shoulders to his legges six, from his legs to his knees a foote in length, from the Articles to the hooues foure ounces, in his whole length sixe feete. And this is the stature of a couragious and middle horsse, for I know there are both big∣ger and lesser. The quality and the measure of the nerues of sinnewes is this, from the middle nost∣rils through the heade necke and backe bone, is a dubble file or thred to the toppe of the taile, which contayneth twelue foot in length. The two broad sinnews in the necke do con∣taine foure-foot, from the shoulders to the knees, there are two sinnewes, from the knee to the bottome of the foot there are foure sinnewes, in the fore-legs there are ten sinnews in the hinder legges there are other ten sinnewes, from the reynes to the stones there are foure sinnewes, so the whole number of them amounteth to thirty foure. Consequently the number of the vaines is to be declared. In the pallet or roofe of the mouth, there are two vaines, vnder the eies other two, in the brest other two, and in the legges other two, foure vnder the pastrones, two in the ancles, foure in the crowne of the pastrones, foure out of the thighes, two out of the loines, two out of the Gambaes, one out of the tayle, and two in the wombe or Matrix, so the whole number is nine and twenty. There are certaine vaines aboue the eies which are diuided in horsses, wherin they are let blood, by making to them small incisions the blood also is taken out of the vaines, in the pallet or roofe of the mouth. There was an auncient custome of letting horsses blood vpon Saint Steuens day, by reason of many holy daies one succeeding another, but that custome is now growne out of vse: Also some take blood out of the Matrixe vaines, but that is not to be admitted in geldings, because with their stones they lose a great part of their heat, excepting extreame necessity, but out of the pallat bloode may bee let euery moneth and stallions when they are kept from mares, if the vaine of their mouthes bee opened, fal into blindnes, although it is no good part of husbandry to let them bleed that yeare, wherein they admit copulation, for the vacuation of blood and seede, is a dubble charge to nature. But the Organicall vaine of the necke, is the best letting of blood, both in stoned and gelded horsses. The later leaches make incision in the great vaine called Fontanella, and in Inen Thymus or Iugulis. The eies of a horsse are grey, or glassy, and it is reported by Au∣gustus, that his eies were much more brighter then other mens, resembling horsses: these eies see perfectly in the night, yet their colour varieth as it doth in men, according to the caprine and glazie humor. And sometimes it falleth out, that one, and the same horsse hath two eies of distinct colours. When the eies of a horsse hang outward, he is called Ex∣ophthalmos. Such faire eies are best, for Bucephalus the horsse of Alexander had such eies, but when the eies hang inward, they are called Coeloph-Thalmoi, and the Parthians count them the best horsses, Coelius. whose eies are of diuers colours, and are therefore called Heteroph Thalmoi, because the breed of that horsse was said to take the beginning from the Parthi∣ans, and the reason why the people loued these horsses was, because they were fearefull, and apt to run away in warres. The eares of a horsse, are tokens and notes of his stomacke, as a taile is to a Lyon, Aristotle. his teeth are changed, yet they grow close together like a mans. It is a hard thing for a Horsse to haue a good mouth, except his stallion teeth bee pulled out, for when he is chafed or heated, he cannot be helde backe by his rider, but disdaineth the bridle: wherefore after they be three yeare and a halfe old, those teeth ought to be pulled forth. In old age, a hor∣ses teeth grow whiter, but in other creatures blacker. A mare hath two vdders betwixt her thighes, yet bringeth foorth but one at a time: many of the Mares haue no paps at al, but only they which are like their dammes. In the heart of a Horsse there is a little bone, like as in an Oxe, and a Mule, he hath no gall like Mules, and Asses, and other whole-footed-beastes, howsoeuer (some say) it lyeth in his belly, and others that it cleaueth to his liuer, or to the gut-colon. The smal guts of a horse lie neare that gut, that so oneside of his belly may bee free and full of passage; and from hence it commeth, that the best Horsses, when they runne or trauel hard, haue a noyse or rumbling in their belly. The hip-bone of a horsse is called by some the Haunch, as the A∣rabians say, the taile, (because therwith he driueth away flies) is called Muscarium, it ought to be long, and ful of haires. The legges are called Gambae of Campo, signifying treading: the hooues of a horsse ought neither to be high nor very low, neither ought the horsse to rest vpon his ancles, and those horsses which haue straight bones in the Articles of their hinder knees, set harde on the grounde, and weary the ryder: but where the bones are short in the same places, as they are in Dogges, there the horsse also breaketh, and woun∣deth one legge with another, and therefore such horsses are called Cynopodae. They haue also quicke flesh in their hooues, and their hooues are sometimes called hornes, vppon which for their better trauel, men haue deuised to fasten yron plates or shooes. This hoof ought to be hard and hollow, that the Beast may not bee offended, when he goeth vppon stones; they ought not to be white, nor broade, but alwaies kept moist, that so they may trauel the better, hauing strong feet, hard and sound hooues, for which cause the Grae∣cians call them Eupodes. Forasmuch as it is requisite for euery man to prouide him horsses of the best race, The Horses of diuers no∣tions. and their kinds are diuers in most places of the world, so the coursers of horsses do many times beguil the simpler sort of buyers, by lying and deceiptful affirmation of the wrong countries of the best horsses, which thinge bringeth a confusion: for there are as many kinds of horsses as nations, I will therefore declare seuerally the countries breeding the horsses, for the Region and aire maketh in them much alteration, that so the reader may in a short view see a muster of horsses made of all nations. The wildernes of Arcauania, Oppianus and Etolia is as fit for feeding of horsses as Thessalie. The horsses of the Greekes, Armenians, and Troians are fit for war, of the Greekish I wil speake more afterward. Alexandria was wont to take great delight in horsses and combats of horsses: Apolonius Horses with hornes and winges Appolo∣nius writeth Lib. 5. Aethiopia (as it is reported) breedeth horsses hauing wings and horns. Varro commendeth the Apulian horsses, and Volatteranus writeth, that they and the horsses of Rosea are most fit for warre: he meaneth aboue all the horsses of Italy. There haue bene very fruitful pastures in Arcadia for cattell, especially for breeding horsses and Asses that are Stallions, for the procreation of Mules, and the breed of the Arcadian horses excelleth. The same man prefereth the horsses of Thessalia & the Grekish horsses, for they are sound of their feete and heade, but not of comely buttockes, they haue their backe bone whole, Ruellius great, and short. The latter two I might haue referred to the whole body of the horsse. Absyrtus The horsses of Armenia are very necessary and conuenient for war, for they and the Capadocians do breed of the Parthian horsses, sauing their heads are somewhat bigger. Of the Hackney or com∣mon horsses, I wil say more afterward where I touch the difference of horsses, and of their pace. The Barbarian horsses are the same as the Lybian horsses. Vegetius commendeth the horsses of Toringa and Burgundia after them of Vonusci. Brittaine breedeth little horsses & amblers. Of horsses that are celebrate of the Calpian mountaine, See in the Spanish. The horsses of Cappadocia and Armenia haue their breed of the Parthians, but their heades are bigger, and are of a most famous nobilitie, for that country before any other land, Ʋegetius. is most commodious for the nourishing of horsses, according to the verses of Nemesian : Cappadocumque not as referat generosa propago, Armata & palmas nuper grex omnis auorum. The Cappadocians do pay to the Persians euery yeare, beside siluer, a thousand and fiue hundred Horsses, &c. The Medes haue the doble of these, and they Sir-name the Cappado∣cians horsses famous and swift, for he saith, that whiles these are young, they are accoun∣ted weake by reason of their young teeth, and their body feeding on milke, but the older they grow, Strabo. so much the swifter they are, being very couragious and apt for war and hun∣ting, for they are not afraid of weapons, neither to encounter with wilde beasts. Mazaca is a citty of Cappadocia, scituate vnder the mountaine Argaeus now called Cesarea, as Euse∣bius remembreth in his Chronicles, and from that citty commeth the Mazacenian horsse for the Cappadocian horsse. Suetonius And not onely the countrey, but the citty it selfe sometime was called Cappadocia from this citty or walled towne I suppose the horsses of Mazaca were so called, which Oppianus calleth Mazaci, of these also and more, I will set downe these verses of Nemesian : Sit tibi praeterea sonipes Maurusia tellus Quemque coloratus Mazax deserta per arua Ne pigeat quod turpe deformis & aluus Q oque iubis pronos ceruix diuerberet armos Paret in obsequium lentae moderamine virgae. Q in & promissi spatiosa per aequora campi, Paulatimque, auidos post terga relinquunt. Cum se Threicius Boreas super extulit antro, &c His etiam emerito vigor est iuuenilis in aeuo. Non prius est animo quam corpore passa ruina. Quem mittit modo sit gentile sanguine firmus, Pauit, & assiduos docuit tolerare labores Est illis, quodque infrenes, quod liber vterque, Nam flecti facilis, lasciuaque colla secutus Verbera sunt praecepta fugae, sunt verbera freni. Cursibus acquirunt commoto sanguine vires, Haud secus effusis Nerei per caerula ventis, Horum tarda venit longi fiducia cursus: Nam quaecunqne suis virtus bene floruit annis. And peraduenture Nemesianus vnderstood certaine horsses of Lybia, by the name of the Mazacion horsses, when as he ioyns them with the Maurasian horsses, and cal them painted Mauzacion horsses, which agreeth not with Cappadocian, writing also, that they are ruled with a stroke of aire insteed of a bridle, which thing we haue reade in Authors writing of the Masylian horsses in the countrie of Lybia, and whereof we will speak when we discourse of the Lybian horsses. But the Cappadocian horsses are swift and lusty in their old age, as it is related by Oppianns. Againe if Mazacian horsses be the same that the Cappadocian are, what is the reason why Oppianus doth name them apt, vnlesse peraduenture euerie Mazaci∣an horsse is a Cappadocian, and not otherwise. The horsses of Chalambria, are so named of a place in Lybia, Varrius the Cheonian horsses are the same with the Aprirolan horsses. The Colopho∣nians and Magnetians do bestow great labour in breeding of horsses, for the Colophonians dwell in a plaine, as I haue read in a certaine Greeke author Strabo lib. 14. writeth that the Colophonians in times past did abound with sea-forces, and haue much excelled in horsse∣men, that wheresoeuer in anie nation there was waged warre, they hired and required the aide of the Colophonian horsse-men, and so it was made a common prouerbe: Colophonem addidit Erasmus. The horsses of Creet are commended by Oppianus and else-where. From their loines vpward they are as bigge as the Cyrenian horsses, with well set thighes, excel∣lent for the soundnes of their feet, and holding their breath a long time in riding, and ther∣fore fit for single races or in chariots. Strabo The Epean horsses, are remembred of Oppianus, and the Epeans are a people of Achaia, and the Achaian horsses are commended of the same. The Lipidanean kinde of horsses is more excellent; and he preserreth the Thessalian horsses before those of Epidaurea, but the Epieotian horses are biting and stubborne: Absyrtus saith, that the Epieotian horses, & the Samerican and Dalmatian, although they are stubborne and wil not abide the bridle, and besides are base and contemptible, yet they are bold in war and combats, and there∣fore the Epieotian horses and the Sicilian despise not if their qualities and comely parts be aparant in them, although sometime he hath run awaie from the enemie, as the poet saith: Quamuis saepe fugaille verso egerit hostes, Et patria Epirum referat. Epiria and Chaonia, is also a part of Epirus Alpestrian, although sometimes it be taken for the whole country of Epirus. The horsses of Chaonia are commended, as Gratius remem∣breth, writing of the Sicylian horsses, in these verses to this effect, that no man hath pre∣sumed to striue with the Chaonians, and the Achaian hand doth not expresse their deserts: Queis Chaonia contendere coatra, Ausit, vix merita quas signat Achata palma. There are a people of Arabia called Erembi, which some some call Ichthyophagans, Oppianus and Trogloditans. Vegetius in the thirde place commendeth the Frisian Horsses for swiftnesse and long continuance of course, after the Hunnian, Burgundians. The French horsse is the same that the Menapians, and S. Hierom writeth, that wordly men are delighted with the French geldings, but Zacharies Asse loosed from his bandes, reioyceth good men. Lu∣cius Apuleius hath commended the French beasts, for if the young sole be deriued of a ge∣nereous kind, it is an argument it wil proue a noble beast. The Gelanoian horsses are a kind of base horsses not fit for warre, whether this name proceed of a strange contrey, I haue no certaine knowledge thereof. There is a certaine riuer in Sicilia called Gelas, of which country the horsses are of great value and much set by. And also the Gelons are a people of Scythia, who in their flight fight vpp∣on horsses, of which Lucanus writeth to this effect. Massagetes quo fugit equo, fortesque; Geloni. And Virgill, Bisaltae quo more solent, acerque; Gelonus. Cum fugit in Rhodopen, aut in deserta Getarum. Et lac coueretum cum sanguine potat equino, signifying thus much that the Massagetes and valianut Gelons flie away vpon horsses like the Bisaltans, when they flye into Rhodope, or into the wildernesse of the Gelans, and drinke milke mixed with horsse-blood for hunger and famine. But these fearefull horsses are not meet for war. Germania hath greater horsses and hard trotters, whose pace is very hard and troublesome. The Ge∣tican horsses runne most swiftly. The horsses of the Greeks haue good sound broad feet, Aelianus. and of a great body, a comely fine head, their forepart somewhat high of stature, straight and well compacted, and of a wel fashioned body, but the ioyning of their buttockes not so agreeable and answerable to the rest: they are most swift and couragious, yet notwith∣standing in all Greece the Thessalian horsses are most esteemed, Nemesianus writeth also of the Greekish horsses. Greece therefore yeeldeth choice horsses, Absyrtus and well hoofed. In Heluetia the horsses are fitted and very expect in war, and especially the Algecian hors∣ses, which will last and continue a long time. In Spaine also the horsses are of a great stature of body, well proportioned and strait, hauing a fine head, the ioynts of their bodies very well deuided, set a part, and ready or flexible, simple and short burtockes, but not very strong and comely. They are stronge and able to sustaine the vndergoing or compassing of iourneyes, neither are they slender bodied or subiect to leannesse, but they are nothing nimble for course, as shall appeare by the words of the Authors following, neither are they spurred when they are ridden: Ruellius from their growing euen to their middle age, they are pliant and easie to be handled, af∣terward they waxe wilde and biting. The Cappadocian horsse is renowned, the like, or the next triumph or victory haue the Spanish horsses in running the ring. Neither doeth Siuilia yeeld horsses inferior for the ring then those: and Affrica is accustomed to bring foorth the most swift Horsses by copulation with the Spanish bloode to the vse of the saddle. Oppianus saith that their Iberan horsses are more excellent, and do so much surre-passe other horsses in swiftnesse, how much the Eagle or the winding Hawke in the ayre, & the Dolphin in the sea excelleth other birds and fishes, but they are smal and of little strength and no corage (although Absyrtus affirmeth) if you read him well, that they are of a great stature of bodie, they being rid but a little way do loose their swiftnes of pace, they are of a comely body, but their hooues are not hollow or hard. The Spanish horsses are desired of great Princes and Peers: Camerarius. & the Maguates because their opinion is that they are swift and nimble, and out of Spaine they are respected for lightnes and elegancy. The iudgement of the auncients for the general breed of horsses was this, that the greatest horsses are bred from the third climat, to the end of the sixt and most of al in Spaine, yet we haue seene stronger and bigger horsses bred in the seuenth climat, and those more able to indure labor then those that are vnder the thirde or fourth climat. The Horsses of the Celliberans somewhat a dusty colour: and they chaung if they bee transported into the farther Spaine, Albertus and the Parthian Horsses are like them in regard they excel in nimblenes and dexterity of running, wherof Martial writeth thus, Videbis altam li∣ciane Bilbilim equis & armis vobilem: which Bilbilis is a Citty of Celiberia. Of the Callacians and Genntes we will speake also in the Spanish Horsses that are bred in the Calpian Moun∣taine afterward, Strabo when wee entreate the differences of Horsses according to their de∣gree. The Hunnes bring vp their Horsses hardly, able to indure cold and hunger, and they haue great and crooked heads, staring eies, straight Nostrils, broad chappes, and strong and rough Neckes, and long manes downe to their Legges; great ribbes, straight backs, bushy tailes, strong shankes or Legges, small feete, full and wide hoofes, their flankes hollow, and all their whole body full of holes. There is no fatnesse in their hanch or but∣tocks, they haue no strings in their sinnewes or arteries, and they exceede in length more then in highth, hauing great bellies hanging downe, big-boned and leannesse (which is a deformitye in other Horsses) in these it shewed their statelinesse: their courage is mo∣derate and wary, and these are able to indure woundes. These Hunnian Horsses else where he calleth them Hunnican Horsses, and the same in times past Hunnes: but they are called a daies Vngarian Horsses. The companies or armies of Hunnes, wandering vp and downe with most swift horses filled al things with slaughter and terror. They are biting & kicking horsses, as most Panno∣nicks are (for they call Panonia at this day Hungaria ) of which there is a prouerbe of Malig∣nity sprung vp, Non nisi irritati aut opin one offensae metu ferociunt: that is to say. They wax not ferne or rage not, Ʋegetius but either by opinion or fear of offense affirming that the Pannoni∣ans are very fit for War. There is not any that can hold and constrain or draw the bridles in, or loose them forth, that rydeth an Indian Horsse when hee praunseth and runneth violently, but such a one that hath beene trained vppe from his childhood in the skill of Horsses: these men haue accustomed to hold them with the bridle, and also to break their wilfulnesse by snaffles or bits, and those that are well skilled in handling Horsses do, com∣pell them from their vnrulinesse, and restraine them within a small cyrcuit. Yet notwith∣standing to make this circle and finish it, it requireth the help of hands, and it is a great skil belonging to horsemen. They which are most skilfull of this art, and cunning dooers of it, know very wel how to bring their course into a circle, whose compasse is not to be regarded chiefely when it can beare but two Souldiers fighting together at one time. Aelianus There are among the Indi∣an Psyllans (for there are also other Affricks of that name) Horsses bred no bigger then Rams, and they say that in Indian there are Horsses with one horne, of which horne drin∣king cups may be made, hauing this vertue in them, that if you put poyson into them and a man drinke thereof it shall not hurt him, because the horne doth driue away or expell the euill or poyson. Whereof you shall see more at large in the History of Monocerotes : and Aelianus himselfe else where, and Philes following him, write the same thing of a cup made of the horne of an Indian Asse, hauing one horne. The Istrian Horsses are of good able feete, very straight, whole backt, and hollow, but swift of course. Oppianus. The Moores Horsses (saith Oppianus ) are most excellent, as well to holde out long courses, as also to indure hard labours: the Lybians next vnto these are of a most durable celerity: they are shaped alike, except that the Lybian horsses are big, and of a longer body, hauing thicker ribs and sides, and their brest is larger before on their crest: they can easily abide the heate of the sun and daily thirst. Affrica hath beene accustomed to put the most swiftest horsses of the Spanish blood to the vse of the saddle: and ( Liuius saith) in Lib. 23. that it was a custome to the Numidi∣ans, being in battell to leade two horsses together, and in manner of vauters often∣times, in the most sharpe conflict could leap from the weary horsse to a fresh, (so great was the dexterity of the rider and the docibility of the beast.) From Tunis of Affrica, Mas∣salia, and Numidia, there are also brought very singular horsses, passing for running, which the common people call Barbary horsses. The Massylians (a people of Lybia) haue verie good horsses, which they gouerne with a rod without a bridles, from whence Virgill in his fourth of his Aeneidos calleth them vntamed and wilde Numides: and Siluis saith also; The Numides a nation hauing no skil of the bridle, do leap vp and downe here and there and euery where, as Martiall writeth: Hic passim exultant Numidae gens in scia freni Quis inter geminas per ludum nobilis aures Quadrupedem fllectit non cedens virga lupati. Also the rod rules the Massilian horsse: the same Nemesianus writeth of those which hee calleth Mazacians (as I haue before spoken of the Cappadocian horsses.) The Dorcadian hor∣ses although they are of a marueilous swiftnes, yet they are inferior to the Lybian horses in running. The Lybian Mares are taken with a pipe, and by these allurements they are made tame and leaue off all wilde qualities, and whither soeuer the pipe shal allvre them, thither they follow, and the shepheard when he stands, they leaue of marching forward, and if he sing more pleasantly, they are so delighted with it, that they cannot hold teares. The Shepheards of these flockes, make their shepheards pipe of the tree (called Rhodo∣daphus ) the sound whereof delighteth those that go before the heard. Gratius also writeth to that effect; Fingit equos Pisis Numidae &c. Audax & patiens operum genus ille vigebit Centum actus spatijs atque eluctabitur iram Nec magni cultus sterilis quodcunque remisit Terra sui tenuesque sitis producere riui. Although the place be not perfect, yet that is spoken concerning the Numidian and Ly∣bian horsses, is manifest as well by the wordes of Oppianus before recited, as also by that which Aelianus setteth downe: for (saith he) I haue heard these thinges touching the Ly∣bian horsses of the men of that nation, that of all other horsses they are the swiftest, and that they haue no sence of their labors, being lanke by reason of their slendernes and thin∣nesse of their shape, and are wholy of themselues fit to endure their maisters negligence, for their maisters giue them no meat or fodder, neyther doeth any man rubbe or dresse them with the curry-combe after they haue labored or traueld; neither do they lay anie litter or straw for them to lie on, nor pare their hooues, but so soone as they haue ended their iourney, leaping off their backes, they turne them to seeke their foode: and in like manner the men of Lybia worne with leanesse, and al besmeard with filth, do ride on hor∣ses of this sort. The horsses and Oxen of Affrica, which dwell between Getulia and vs, are as ours, that is, hauing longer lips (the interpreter translates it hooues.) Their kinges take delight in troopes of horsses, so that there are numbred to him euery yeare one hundred thousand Coltes. The Chalambrian Libians are before spoken of, and the Nasauions we will speake of here after. Barbarie breedeth very fewe Horses, but the Arabians which inhabite in the desart, and the people of Libia doe breed very many, and they do not so much accustome them to iourneyes and warfare, as to Hunting, and feeding them with Camels milke only twise a day and night, whereby they keepe them fine, but very leane, and in the time of grasse, they turne them out to feede in the fielde, but they ride not on them. The Horsses of Massilia are equall with the Libians. The people of Magnetia haue been renowned in feeding and bringing vp Horses, and they are very skillfull in combate on Horse-backe (as Lucanus saith.) The Magnetians are famous for Horsses, and the nation of Nycaia for Oares: Magnetia is a contrey of Macedonia, bordering vppon, Thessalie, so the Citty and countrey of Asia lyeth toward Maeandrus. Opianus commendeth the Magnetian Horsses. The Moores sight often on Horse-backe with speares, but their Horses are naked and their bridles made of rushes. The Massylians following the Lybians (for the most part) are furnished after that maner, and they resemble others, hauing little horsses, both swift, obedient, and easily to be ru∣led with a rod. Strabo. The collars of their horses are made of wood or haire, whereby the bridles hange The principall horsses of Barbarie are not swift, but in respect they liue on fodder they are more handsome and better in flesh, which they vse in eminent daunger when it stan∣deth them vpon to escape the rage of their enemies. Thus far I haue related the words of Oppianus, Leo Assric iu touching the norishing of horsses, among the Lybians, where he sheweth that they are all alike, both in shape and other proportion. Touching the Nemesian horsses, they are all one with the Maurans and Marusans (as Strabo witnesseth) calling them nimbe and swift kinds amongst the Moores. The Sicilians are swifter then the Moores, and the Moores are of a more valiaunt cou∣rage then the Sicilians, or some such like other thing, who are furnished with yellow co∣lours, and shew to the eye most shining and splendant, and which is more they only de∣sire the roaring of a Lyon, for which when they come to other wilde beasts by way of hunting, he commendeth them to be excellent: then he sayth that the yellow is the best colour. In the country of Mauritania are great store of Lyons, and of the Nazacanos wee haue spoke of before sufficiently. The Median horsses are of exceeding greatnesse, and the men of that countrey are so bewitched with the rich attire and shape of their bodies, Absyrtus and also their horsses being so loose with super fluity or rankenes, that the horses take de∣light in their maisters, both in greatnes and infairenes of body, and such costly furniture vpon their backes, Aelianus that they seeme to perceiue their owne stature and comelines. The Medes euery year by way of custome pay 3. thousand horses. Herodotus also calleth the Nisean horses the Medes, wherof more shalbe spoke afterwards. The Menapians amongst our countrimen the onely men, which I suppose were once cald French of Caesar and the Rugians, (as warriours for the most part are in estimation. I also find that the Rugians in∣habited that country which is now called Rugerland, and that Paulus Diaconus remem∣breth them lib. 1. Touching the affaires of Longobardus, there are that say they departed into Mechelbur∣gia. These are the right off spring of the Germaines (saith Althametus ) they are counted as Germaines, both in language and vertue. Gratius writeth of the Marcibians, saying the Marcibians scarce yeld their tough necke to the sword. Virgill also declareth Mycenia to be a countrie of moste notable horses: and Gratius commendeth a horse fit for huntinge highly in these verses: Consule Penei qualis prefunditur amne Thessalus aut patriae quem conspexere mycaenae Glaucum nempe ingens nempe ardua fundit in auras Orura quis Eleas potior lustrault arenas? Ne tamen hoc attingat opus iact antior illi Virtus quam siluas duramque lacessere martem. The Mylian horsses were once great in estimation (as Camerarius writeth; Also the Mesa∣monians are a people of Lybia, liuing as spoilers of the ships of Syrtea. Of all these horses beforsaid, the Missaean horse is the goodliest, and fittest to cary the body of a King, they are of a passing good shape, an easie pace, and verie submissiue to the bridle; hauing a lit∣tle head, and a long and thicke mane, with yellow or browne haires hanging downe on both sides: Armenia is verie fit for feeding horses, wherin is a certain meddow called Hip∣poboans by which they make their iourney which passe from Persia and Babylon into the Caspian border, in which place they feede fiue hundred Mares which belong vnto their King. The Misaean horses (written with Iota and simple Sigma, as Eustathius writeth) are the most excellent and best; some say that they haue their generation from Germanie, others out of Armenia, but they haue a certaine kind of shape like the Parthians. In India most of their liuing creatures are far greater then in other places (except horses) for the Misaean horsses, do exceede the Indian horsses, as Herodotus writeth) in his sea∣uenth booke, describing the Persian horsse. Behind the speares (saith he) came ten Hor∣ses in most sumptuous furniture, which were Nisaeans, so called, because there is a great field named Nisaeus in the countrey of Medica, which yeeldeth horsses of a great stature. After these followed Iupiters chariot drawne with eight horsses, after which Xerxes was caried in a chariot drawne by Nisaean horsses, and by how much the greater the Lybian Elephant is then the Nisaean horsse, so much greater are the Nisaean horsses then the In∣dian (as the same man saieth) in his first booke: but the king was about to offer a white horse, that is of the Nisaean horses, hauing a better marke as some expounded. There are that say that Nisaeus is a plane of Persis, where the most famous and notable horsses are bred. Some interpret it to they yellow Nisaean horsse, because all the horsses of Nisaean are of this colour. Betweene Susinax and Bactria, there is a place which the Greeks call ( Nisos ) in which the most singular fine horsses are bred. There are also that suppose they are had from the red sea, and al those to be of a yellow colour. Herodotus writinge of Nisaeus maketh it a part of Media. Orpheus also writeth that there is a place in the red Sea called Nisa. Stephanus also maketh mention of ( Nysaean Pedion ) with the Medes, of which people the horsses are so called. Coelius Rhodiginus reproued a certaine man which tran∣slanted the Islandish horsses for the Nisaean horsses. Plutarchis saith that Pirrhus had an apparition of a Nisaean horsse armed and furnished with a rider, that Alexander the great was captaine thereof. The Medes haue Colts of a most noble kind of horsses, which (as auncient writers do teach vs, and as we our selues haue seene) men when they beginne the battell with a fierce encounter are wont to prance valiantly, which are called Nisaean horses. Touching the Paphlagonians about the education of their horsses see more among the Venetians: The Parthian horses are of a large body, couragious, of a gentle kinde and most sound of their feet. Concerning those horsses which haue but one eye, commended among the Parthians, and of those which are distinguished by diuersitie of colors, from those that come forth first, I haue spoke already out of Absyrtus. The Armenian and Par∣thian horsses are of a swifter pace then the Siculians, and the Iberi swifter then the Parthi∣ans, whereof Gratius writeth to this effect: Scilicit & Parthis inter sua mollia rura Musit honor veniat Caudini saxa Taburni Gargamdue trucem, aut ligurinas de super Alpes Ante opus excussis caedet vnguibus; & tamen illi Estanimus, funget que meas senissus in artes Sed iuxta vitium posuit Deus. That is to say among the Parthians there hath remained honor for their soft Countries, but let him come to the Rockes of Caudmus, Tabernus and too rough Garganus, or vppon the Ligurian Alpes, then he will quickly shake off his hooues: and make a shew of great valiantnes. The horses of the Celtibarians are somwhat white, and if they may be brought into Spaine they change their colour. But the Parthians are alike, for they excell all others in nimblenes and dexterity of running: How the Parthians do make their pace easie in the trotters and hard footing horsses, after the manner of geldings, shall bee declared after∣wards, for persia preferreth these horsses aboue the censure of their patrimonies, aswell to cary, (hauing an easie pace) and being of most excellent dignity: As for their pace it is thicke and short, and he doth delight and lift vp the rider being not instructed by art, but effecteth it by nature. Amongst these ambling nagges, (called of the Latines among the common sort Toto∣narij ) their pace is indifferent, and whereas they are not alike, they are supposed to haue something common from both; as it hath bin prooued: whereof Vegetius writeth in this manner. In a short iourny they haue the more comelines and grace in going, but when they trauel far they are impatient, stuborn, and vnles they be tamed wil be stuborn against the rider; and that which is a more greater maruell, when they are chafed, they are of a delightfull comelines, their necke turneth in manner of a bow, that is seemeth to lie on their brest. The Pharsalian mares euermore bring foales very like their Syre, and therfore very well so named, Equae probae, we read of the Phasian horsses which receiue their name (from the the marke or brand of a bird so named) or else because of their excellent beauty and com∣linesse. The Rosean horsses Varro so nameth of Rosea, which Volatteranus writeth to be most fit for war: Coelius and this Rosea otherwise Roscea, Festus saith, that it is a country in the the coasts of the Reatiens, so called, because the fields are said to be moist with that dew. The horsses of Sacae if they happen to throw down their rider, they forthwith stand stil that they may get vp againe Vegetius hauing commended the Persian horsses saith, that the Armenians and Sapharens do follow next. Aelianus. This Saphirine verily is an Island in the Arabian coast, and the people of Sapiria lie beside Pontus. The horses of Epirota, Salmarica, and Dalmatia, al∣thogh they wil not abide to be bridled, yet they snew that they are warlicke by their legs. Ʋegetius The Sardinian horsses are nimble and fair, but lesser then others. The Sarmatican kinde of horsses is feat and wel fashioned in this kind, very fit for running, vnmixt, hauing a wel se body, a strong head, and a comely necke. Some horsses they cal Aetogenes, from a certaine marke which they haue in their shoulders and colour, which the Sarmatians doe take vnto themselues as very good, with which they doe contend about their cruelty, wherefore they imploy them in warlicke outrodes, but those that beare the Eagles marke in their buttockes and taile, they are disallowed of them, and they report that they marke them so because they wil not vse them, by reason least the rider shold quickly be destroy∣ed or run into some trouble. Pliny. The Sarmatians when they entend any long iourneyes, the day before they keepe them fasting, giuing them a little drinke, and so they wil ride them a hundered and fifty miles continually going. These horsses are very fit for war, and many of them are sounde gelded in ther tender age, and they say they neuer loose their teeth. It is a custome of Scythia and Sarmatia to geld their horsses to make them more gentle: they are swift, litle, and fierce, but very stubborne and vntamed, neither doeth Circo, (scituate neare Sicili ) breed horsses inferior to the Spanish, as Vegetius writeth. The Epirotan and Siculian hor∣ses are not to be despised, if they were well bred and educated, they want not comelinesse and good qualities. The Siculian horsses are most swift. Litlybaeum is a promontory of Sicilia lying towards Lybia, which a certaine verse maketh more plain but as I vnderstand it is the three-clift∣topt-mountaine Aetna, which casteth forth fire, and couereth the carcasse of Euceladus the Gianut, lyeng there vnder, (whereof Oppianus writeth) and some others also. But (saith he) the Armenians and Parthians haue swifter coursers by farre, then the Siculians. Now, let vs heare Gratius himselfe, discoursing of the Siculian horsses, as wel as of the Lybycan. Sic & strymonio f cilis tutela Bisaltae, Possent Aetnaeas vtinam seferre per artes. Quiludus Siculis: quid tum si turpia colla Aut tenuis dorso curuatur spina? per illos Cantalus Graijs Agragas, vict aeque fragosum Ne broden liquere ferae. O quantus in armis Ille meis, cuius docties pecuaria faetus Suff cient queis Chaontas contendere contra Ausit vix merita signat Achaia palma. But as for Gratius I suspect the place to be vnperfect; for Agragas is a mountaine of Sici∣lia, hauing a towne scituate in the top of it bearing the same name, where their auncestors w re wont to nourish and bring vp the best horsses. There is also in Sicilia a mountain cal∣led Mebrodes, Hebrodon which some thinke to be so called by reason of the plentie of dear, but they haue no author for it, and as for the printed booke of Gratius, I finde it expresseth it not so wel as Virgill setteth it downe, saieng, that Agragas was a breeder of most couragious and notable horsses: but yet Serutus saith, (according to Pindarus ) that the Agrigentines in times past sent their horsses to the iusting or combates of Graecia, returning with victorie from thence, and we haue also read that in Cappadocia whole troopes of horsses haue bin destroyed. The men of Delphos by the answere of Apollo got herds and great store of hor∣ses from Agrigentine, and those were excellent. Aristophanes calleth those great Aetnean horsses ( Canthiari ) either of the greatnesse of the mountaine, or else great Canthars are bred in it, or of the horsses of Aetna, being notable for swiftnesse and running. The hor∣ses that are bred in Creet and Cappadoeia are also most excellent. In Greece there are most notable horsses of Thessalie, which Absyrtus saith be the best in all Greece. The words of Gratius the Poet speaking of the Thessalian horsses are before re∣cited. The mares of Admetus were the most excellent, Strabo but as Homer reporteth the Thessa∣lian were before them. The Solitude or wildernes of Arcauanus is as commodious to feed horsses, as Thessalia. It is certaine that Thessalia excels with horsses, from whence Xerxes is said to haue made a combat, that he might try his horsses there where he vnderstoode the best breed of Greekish horsses to be, and from whence this prouerbe arose, Decerne∣tur equa Thessalia (:Viz:) let the Thessalian Mare be tried by battaile, a prouerbe of ex∣cellent worth, because in old time the chiefest praise was of the Thessalian Mares: which is very apparant by the Oracle that was deliuered to the Aeginensians. Suidas relateth (but I know not out of what author) that Thessalia hath excelent horsmen; Thrasia expert shoo∣ters, and India light armor: so hath likewise Creet and Caria. Erasmus writeth that Thessalia is most fit to feed horsses, who do far excel the Arcadi∣ans and Epidaures as Strabo witnesseth lib. 8. Caesar was said (when he was dictator) to haue made the first shew among the Romaines of the Horsses, fighting against buls, Textor. and killing them, whereof Lucianus writeth thus: Thessalius sompes bellis feralibus omen. That is to say: the Thessalian horsse is profitable for fence and deadly conflicts. There is also in Thessalia a citty (named Pella ) from whence I deeme the Pellaean horsses are so cal∣led of Gratius, yet there be other places called Pella (as Macedonia and Achaia ) wherof Gra∣tius writeth thus: Spadices vis Pellaei valuere Cerauni Et tibi deuotae magnum pecuaria Cyrrae Phaebe decus nostras agere in sacraria tousas. Which ( Cerani ) are mounts of Epirus, and Cyrrha is a Towne of Phocis scituate at the foot of the hil Parnassus, where Appollo Cyrrhaeus was worshipped. The Tyrrheans being excel∣lent warriors are commended of Oppianus out of the Islands of the Tyrrhenean sea (especi∣ally Corsica and Sardinia ) there be very short horsses, but they are of good courage and gentle withall. The Thracian horsses are foule and ill-shapen, being rough al ouer their bodyes, Ʋolatteran: and hauing very great shoulders, which in the Greeke is named ( Calomysten ) such a one as wil cast downe the rider on the ground from off his backe, they are crook-backt, or bunched out; or els of diuers kinds; and therefore they haue an vnsure and reeling pace, and their course is yery vnconstant. Absyrtus saith, the Thracian horsses are the best. The Thuringe∣an horsses are neighbors to Hessis, which Pliny and Volatteranus supposed, are called ( Me∣diterranean Cimbri. ) There be some that suppose the Venetians to discend from a people of Paphlagonia, (called Venetaus ) which after the destruction of Troy came to these places, and by these they make an argument, coniecturing it to be good, in regard they are wholy imployed about breeding horsses, which at this time faileth altogether, but in former daies they were very careful to follow their businesse about the training vp of young mules, whereof Homer writeth. And Dyonisius the Tirant of Sicilia ordained, that the breede of horsses should be fetcht from hence, to make warlike combats with them, that among the Grae∣cians the excellencie of the Venetian breede should remaine, and that a great while after that breed of horsses got the praise. Vuallachus this daie is called of the Saxones a gelded horse, & brought out of that countrie which sometimes was called Dacia. The Lycospades and Lycophotians shal be spoken of heerafter. Of the choice of good Horsses, P Aladius aduiseth to obserue foure things in choyse of a Stallion horsse, the forme or outward proportion, the colour, the merrit, and the beau∣ty, all which are necessary to be obserued in the choise of Coltes or el∣der Horsses, that they may be of a generous race, hauing soft legs, lofty paces, gent e treading, such as will lead the way, and be not affraid of a∣ny water, The mem∣bers of an eli¦gble horsse. bridge, nor suddain noises; hauing a gentle necke, a sharpe head, a short bel∣ly, a fat backe, a dapple colour, nimble eares, thicke mane lying on the right side, a dub∣ble bone discending by his loins, a sounding hoofe, and legs that cannot stand stil, which Virgill expresseth in these words: Nec non & pecori est idem delectus equino Tu modo quos in spem statuis, summittere gentis Precipuum iaminde a teneris impende laborem Continnue pecoris, generosi pullus in aruis Altius ingreditur, & mollia crura reponit. Primus & íre viam, & fluuios tentare minaces Audet, & ignoto sese committere ponti: Nec vanos horret crepitus, illa ardua ceruix Argutumque caput, breuis aluus, obesaque terga Luxuriatque toris animo sum pectus honesti Spadices glaucique color, deterrimus albis Et giluo: tam si qua sonum procul arma dedere Stare loco nescit micat auribus & traemit artus Collectumque praemens voluit subnaribus ignem Densa iuba & dextro tactata recumbit in armo Ac duplex agitur perlumbos spina cauatque Tellurem & solido grauiter sonat vngula cornu. Varro sheweth that at the first foaling of a colt, a man may obserue by certain signes how he will proue when he is in perfection: signs to chuse a good Colt. for if he be cheareful, bold, and not terrified at a∣ny strange sight, if he run before the company, be wanton and contend with his equales in course, and ouer-run them: if he leape ouer a ditch, go ouer a bridge, or through wa∣ter, and being prouoked appeareth meeke, these are the most true signes of an elegiable Colt. Also it is to be considered, whether they rise quickly, being stird from their rest, and run away speedily, if their bodies be great, long, full of muscles, and sharpe, hauing a lit∣tle head, blacke eies, open aad wide nostrils, sharpe pricked eares, a soft and broad neck, not long, a thicke mane curled, and falling on the right side, a broad and ful breast, large shoulders, and shoulder-bones, round ribs, a little belly, a dubble backe-bone, or at the least not thin, bunchie or extended; his loines pressed downewards, broad, and well set, little and smal stones, a long taile, with curled haire, highe, straighte and equal legges, round knees not great, nor bending inward, round buttockes, brawny and fleshy thighes, high, Columella Varro Albertus. hard, hollow, and round hooues, wel set to the crowne of their pasterne, hauing vaines conspicuous and apparant ouer al his body. That colt which at the time of his foa∣ling hath the moste highest legges, is likelyest by common reason to proue most able and noble in his age, for of al the ioynts in the body the knees and legges grow least, and they which haue flexible ioynts in their infancy, wil be more nimble and flexible in their age. Of the chois of a horse vn backed or ne¦uer ridden. And thus much for the parts of a colt. Now, in the next place we must likewise take consideration of a horsse vntamed, and ready for the saddle. For the outward partes of his bodie saith Xenophon, yeeld euident signification of his minde, before he be backed. Plato willeth that the state of his body bee straight, and articulate, his head bony, his cheekes little, his eies standing out, and not sunke into his head, flaming like blood, looking cruelly if the body be blacke, but blacke eies if the body be white doe argue a gentler and better disposition: short and little eares, the crowne of his head greater then the residue, broad Nostrils, whereby he not onely looketh more terribly but breatheth more easily, for when one Horsse is angry with another, in their rage they are wont to stretch out their Nostrils vehemently. The beake or snout of a Horsse, ought not to stand out like a swynes, but to bend downe a little crooked, the head to be so ioyned to the necke, as it may bend more com∣modiously, that is, if the necke be small next to the head, so will the necke stand before the rider, and his eies appeare before his feete: and although he bee full of stomacke, yet will he neuer be violent or stiffe necked. It ought also to be considered, whether his cheek∣bones be sharpe, tender, or vnequall, standing one aboue another, for their imparity ma∣keth the Horsses necke to be hard, and stubborne. The backe-bone aboue his shoulders higher commodious to set the saddle vpon, & his whole body the better compacted, if the backe bone be duble, and smooth; for then shall the rider sit more easily, and the forme of the Horsse appeare more delectable. A large brest sheweth his comlinesse and strength, making him fit to take longer reaches without doubling of his Legges, because in a broad breast the Legs stand further asunder: large side or ribbes swelling out aboue the belly, for they shew the ability of the Horsse both to his food and worke, a round euen belly and his loines being broad and short, causeth the forlegs to be lifted vp more easily, and the hinderlegs to follow, for the smal loines do not onely deforme, but enfeeble and oppresse the Horsse, therefore the loines ought to bee duble, the ribbes broad and fleshy, agreeable to the breast and sides, buttocks sollide and broad, with a long taile reaching downe to the heeles of his hinder Legges. Thighes full of sinnewes, the bones of his Legges thicke like the postes of the whole body, but that thicknesse ought neither to be of vaines nor flesh, for then they are quickly inflamed and wounded, when they trauile in rough and sharpe waies: for if the flesh be cut a little, the commissures parte asunder, and causeth the Horsse to halte, and aboue all other thinges haue a regard to his feet, and therin especially to his hoof, for being thick, it is better then being thin, likewise if they be hard, causeth the pasterne to stand higher from the ground, for so in their pace the soft and hard parts of the foote doe equally sustaine one another, and the hard hoofe yealdeth a sound like a Simbal, for the goodnesse of a horse appeareth by the sound of his feete. Now on the contrary side it is good also to set downe the faults and signes of reproba∣tion in Horsses, and first of all therefore, a great and fleshy head, great eares, narrow No∣strils, hollow eyes, a long necke, a mane not hairy, a narrow breast, hollow shoulders, narrow sides, and little fleshy sharpeloines, bare ribs, hard and heauy Legges, knees not apt to bend, weake thighs, not strong, crooked legs, thin, full fleshy, plaine and low hoofs, all these things are to be auoided in the choise of your Horsse. Of the choise of Stallions and breeding Mares. N Ow in the next place let vs consider the choise of Horsses and Mares ap∣pointed for breede and procreation, and we haue shewed already that in a stallion we are principally to consider the colour, forme, merit, and beau∣ty. This Stallion is called in Italy Rozzone, in France Estalon, in Germany Ein Springhengst, and in Latine Admissarius quia ad generandam sobolem admittitur, bicause he is sent to beget and engender. The Graeci. Anabates or Ocheutes. Of the color. First of all therefore to beginne with the colour: that Horsse is best which is of one continued colour, although oftentimes (as Rufus saith) Horsses of a despicable colour proue as Noble as any other. The cheefe colours are these; bay, white, carnation, golden; russet, mouse-colour, fleabitten, spotted, pale and blacke: of all these the blacke or bay is to be preferred. Op∣pianus maketh distinction of Horsses by their colour in this manner, the gray or blewish spotted is fittest for the hunting of the Hart, the bright bay for the Beare and Leopards, the blacke with flaming eies against the Lyons. The naturall colour of the wilde Horsses are an ashe colour with a blacke strake from the head along the backe to the taile, but a∣mong tame Horsses there are many good ones of Black, White, Browne, Red, and flea∣bitten colour. But yet it is to be remembred that seldome or neuer Coultes be foaled white, but rather of other colour, degenerating afterward by the increase of their age for such Horsses are more liuely, durable, and healthy, then other of their kinde, and there∣for Plutarch commendeth a white Horsse of Sylla for his swiftnes of foot and stomacke: a∣mong al colours, r nus first the blacke, then the bay, next the white, and last the gray are most commended. Camerarius commendeth a certain colour cald in Latin Varius and may bee englished da∣ple gray, because of the diuers in-textures of colours, which although many nations doe disalow, yet vndoubtedly, that colour (saith he) is a signe and argument of a good nature, constituted and builded vpon a temporate commixture of humors. Where black, white, and yellow haires appeare, so that the sight of one of these is nothing inferiour to the eque∣striall party coloured caparisons: Among Horsses which are diuers coloured, they which haue stars in their forehead, and one white foote, were most commended; such were the Thrasian Horsses not admitted in copulation, of which Virgill speaketh in this manner; —Thracius albis Portat equus buolor moculis vestigia primi Alba peda, frontemque ostentans arduus albam. Blacke Horsses also which haue one russet or swart spot in their faces, or else a black toung are highly commended for generation, but the pale coloured Horsses are no waies to be admitted to couer Mares, because their colour is of no acount: & likewise it is seldom seen that the Fole proueth better then the sire. The bay colour hath bin receiued without ex∣ception for the best trauailers, for it is supposed that Baudius (amongst the Latines) is de∣riued of Vadium quia inter, coetera animalia fortius vadat ; because among other creatures he goeth most surelye. It is also behoouefull that in a Stallion Horsse, the mane bee of the same colour with the body. Artificial eane to m ke Mares conceiue the best colourd Colts. Horsse-keepers haue deuised to make their Mares conceiue strange colours, for when the Mares would go to the horse, they paint a Stallion with diuers colours, and so bring him into the sight and presence of the Mare; where they suffer him to stand a good while vntill she perfectly conceiue in her imagination the true Idea and ful impression of those pictures, and then they suffer him to couer her; which being performed she concei∣ueth a Foale of those colours: In like manner, Pigeons conceiue younge ones of diuers colours. The Germans to mingle the colour of horses haires (especially to bring blacke among white) take the roots of fearue, and of sage, and seeth them together in leigh, and then wash their horsses all ouer therewith. For the making of their horsses white, they take that fat which ariseth from the decoction of a moule in an earthen pot, and there withal anoint the places they would haue white. Also they shaue off the haires, and put vpon the balde place crude hony, and Badggers grease, which maketh the haires to arise white: and ma∣ny other meanes are vsed by horsse-leatches, as afterward shalbe shewed. In the olde age of a horsse his hair doth naturally change white, aboue all other beasts that we know, and the reason is, because the brain-pan, is a more thin and slender bone, then the greatnesse of his body would require, which appeareth by this, that receiuing a blow in that place, his life is more indangered then by hurting any other member, acording to the obserua∣tion of Homer : Et qua fetae haerent capiti laetaleque vuluus Precipae sit equis. And thus much shall suffice for the colour of a Stallion: now followeth the form or out∣ward proportion of the body, The forme which ought to be great and solide, his stature aunswerable to his strength, his sides large, his buttockes round, his breast broad, his whole body full and rough, with knots of muscles, his foot dry and solide, hauing a high hoofe at the heele. The parts of his beauty are these, a little & dry head, the skin almost cleauing to the bons, short & pricked eares, The beautye of a Stallion. great eies, broad nostrils, a long and large mane and taile, with a so∣lid and fixed rotundity of his hoofes, & such an one, as thrusteth his head deepe into the water when he drinketh, his ribs and loines like an Oxes, a smooth and straight backe, his or hippes long, broad, and fleshy, his Legges large, fleshy and dry, the sinnewes and ioynctures thereof great and not fleshy neare the hoofes: that the hinder part of his bo∣dy be higher then his forepart, like as in a Hart, and this beauty better appeareth in a leane body then in a fat, for fatnesse couereth many faults; the former parts are thus expressed by Horace : Regibus hic mos est vbi equos mercantur, opertos Inspiciunt, nesi facies vt saepe decora. Molli fulta pede est, emptorem inducat hiantem Quod pulchri clunes, breue quod caput ardua ceruix. If you will make triall of your stallion whether he be fit for procreation, Hipparchus teach∣eth you this experiment: presse the genytall member with your two fingers, and with lockes of Woll draw out his seede which being so drawne out, if it cleaue and hang toge∣ther, so as it will not be cut nor easily parted, it is a demonstration of a good Stalion, but if it hang not together like birdlime, but easily go asunder like milke or whay, such a Horse is not to be admitted to couer your Mares. The age of a Stallion. When Horsses be olde among other faultes they engender Foales lame in their feete, and therefore they are to be kept and not to be admitted to copulation nor War, for his rage is like a weake fire among wet stuble accor∣ding to these verses: —Morbo grauis aut segnior annis Deficit, abde domo, nec turpi ignosce senecta Frigidus in venerem senior frustraque laborem Ingratum trahit: & si quando ad praelia ventum est Vt quondam in stipulis magnus sine viribus ignis In cassum furit. Therefore it behooueth that a Stalion Horsse be not vnder three yeares old when he co∣uereth a Mare, and it is best for him to beginne at fiue, Collumella. for so he will indure in generation not onely till he be twenty yeare old, but also to thirty or forty yeares, as in some coun∣tries hath beene often proued. They are not to bee admitted to couer aboue fifteene in one yeare at the most, and a young Horsse not aboue ten or twelue in one yeare; the resi∣due may be suffered with obseruation of their strength and nature. The King of Babilon beside his Horsses War had eight hundreth Stalions, which were admitted to couer sixe thousand Mares, so that euer one had twenty a peece, Palladius. ther is also a place in Syria neare Apamia, where in one plot of ground were nourished thirty thousand Mares, & three thousand Stalions (as Coelius saith) so that euery Stalion had an hundreth Mares to couer (in that place) which number exceedeth the proportion of na∣ture. It is also to be remembred that Stalions are to be seperated from Mares al the yeare long, except at the time of procreation, and then also he must be largely fed according to these verses. His animaduersis, instant sub tempus, & omnes Impendunt cur as denso distendere pingui, Quem legere ducem & pecori duxere maritum: Florentesque secant herbas, fluuiosque mini strant, Farraque: ne blando nequeant superesse labori: Inualidique patrum referant ieiunia nati. Ipsa autem macie tenuant armenta volentes. Atque vbi concubitus primos iam nota voluptas Sollicitat, frondesque negant, & fontibus arcent. Saepe etiam cursu quatiunt, & Sole fatigant: Cum grauiter tunsis gemit area frugibus: & cum Surgentum ad Zephyrum paleae iactantur inanes. Hoc faciunt, nimio ne luxu obtusior vsus Sit genitali aruo, & sulcos oblimet inertes. Sed rapiat sitiens Venerem, interiusque recondat. Absyrtus It is also to be obserued, that the males which are designed for procreation be not ouer much labored, for then he wil be the more weake for generation, nor yet suffered to bee to idle, for then a certaine fleamie humour is increased in them, which likewise disableth them in copulation, and thus much for the males. Almost al the same things which haue bin said of the male, belong to the female, except the belly of the female ought to be greater, The choise of Mares but if there be any whit speckles or spots in the eies of the female, such as are not contracted by accident, but breede in them by nature▪ such a one is refused for breede, for a Horsse borne of such a Mare, when he commeth to be olde, will likewise be affected with the same-blindesse: but if it bee a female, by reason of her yearely purgation, she may peraduenture auoid that mischiefe. It behooueth therefore that the Mares appointed for race, be wel compacted, of a de∣cent quality, being faire and beautifull to looke vpon, the belly and loines being great, age not vnder three nor aboue ten yeares old. The copula∣tion of horses and Mares. Concerning their admission to generation, it is to be remembred, that the Latines haue a proper tearme to signifie the appetite of the female to the male, which they call ( Equire ) that is, (Horssing) and they continue in that lust sixty daies together, the signes whereof are these: They forsake their company, run∣ning not toward the East and West, but the contrary, to the North and South: neither permit they any body to come neare them, vntill they either bee wearied or meete with the male, and if they meet with a female like themselues, they ioyne neare to her, and seeme to reioyce at her society, lifting vp the taile, changing of the voice, and sending forth of her secretes, a certaine thin humour, somewhat like the seede of a horsse, which is called Hippomanes. They also make water more often then at other times, so that among al the females of the world, Aristotle. Albertus. there is none beside a woman, that is more greedy of procreation then a Mare, because they want a menstruous purgation and yet eat aboundance of meat, which Virgill expresseth, setting downe their vnlimitable rage, which carrieth them ouer mountaines and riuers, in the time of this fury. Scilicet ante omnes furor est insignis equarum Et mentem venus ipsa dedit, quo tempore Glauci Potniades malis membra absumpsere quadrigae Illas ducit amor traus Gargara, transque sonantem Ascantum, superant montes & flumina tranant. Also at that time, their genital hangeth forth more then at other times, but if their manes be shorne off, their lust is extinguished. It is reported also by Columella that in Spaine, in the Mountain Tagro which reacheth into Portugall vpon the Ocean, there be Mares which rage so far in lust, that by their ardent desire of copulation they conceue by the Southwest wind, without the company of a horsse, (euen as Hens do lay Egges being not trode by a Cocke) which are called Hypenemia, but those Foales liue not till they be aboue three year old. And it is the property of these Mares (saith Auicen ) by kicking against the wind with their hinder legs, to open their owne wombe, and to receiue in that delectable aire, wher∣withall they are satisfied. Also he saith, that he heard of an old man, which was borne in the Ile of Pealtupha, that the Mares therof neuer cease running, from thone end of the Iland to the other, when the rage of their lust is vppon them; which thing is elegantly described by a Poet, how they turne themselues to the West, standing vpon the rockes, and there draw in the cold aire, which oftentimes maketh them conceiue, wondering that they conceiue not rather by the east sunrising or South, then by the westerly wind bordering vpon the north, the Poets words are these: Continuoque auidis vbi subdita flamma medullis, Vere magis (quia vere calor redit ossibus) illae Ore omnes versae in Zephyrum, stant rupibus altis Exceptamque leues auras: & saepe sine vllis Coniugijs vento grauidae (mirabile dictu) Saxa per, & scopulos, & depressas conualles Diffugiunt, non Eure tuos neque Solis adortus: In Boream Caurum{que} aut vide Nigerrimus auster Nascitur, & pluuio contristat frigore coelum. Sometimes Horsses and Mares admit copulation at two yeare old, but those Foales neuer proue excellent, but at three yeare old or thirty monthes, they suffer coniunction safely and with profit, because they cease to loose their teeth. Pliny They continue in their generati∣on, bearing euery second yeare, the male vntill he be thirty yeare olde, and the female as long as she liueth; but the male ingendereth yearely; And it is reported of a horse in O∣pus, that couered a Mare after he was forty yeare old, being onely holp vp and down from the Mare. Pliny, Oppianus, Aelianus, and Aristotle, doe confidently affirme, A history of a stallion to his own dam that when the King of Scythia had all his generous breede of Horsse destroyed by a pestilence (except one of his best Mares and a Stallion which was a Foale of that Mares) being desirous to continue the breede, caused his horsse-keeper to put the Sonne and Mother together, but the Horsse refused copulation with his owne parents. Afterward the Horsse-keeper coue∣red the Mare with artificiall skinnes, and likewise dressed the Horsse in such manner, as one could not know the other, wherupon being brought together the second time, the Stallion couered his owne mother: Afterward the Horsse keeper discouered them, the one to the other, whereby they knew the fraude, and grew guiltye in themselues, of ince∣stious commixtion; Whereupon they tooke no other reuenge vppon themselues, but ranne to the top of a high rocke, and there successiuely threw downe themselues, one af∣ter another, so ending their miserable daies, & preuenting their Maisters hopes; to teach al mankind, that they ought not to seeke to thriue by sins against nature, the like is before rehearsed of a male Camell. The very like story is reported of a Horsse in the coasts of Rea, yet this is not held to be ge∣nerall: for beasts (as Aristotle saith) do promiscuously couer one another; the father the Daughter, the Sonne the mother, the Brother the Sister, and this maketh them to be per∣fect beasts; and the stories before recited may be true, yet are they extraordinary: other∣wise the common rule of Ouid remaineth true. That it is not a filthy thing for beasts to ob∣serue no degrees of nature. —Coeunt ani malia mullo Caetera delectu, nechabetur turpe iuuencae Ferre patrem tergo, fit equo sua filia coniux. The best time of the yeare for the ioyning of Horsses and Mares for copulation, is from the vernall aequinoctiall to the summer solstice, because then the Coults which are foaled in due time, haue the greene herbes and all the warme weather for the succour of their in∣fancy: and if the Mare (after shee hath beene once couered) refuse the male, let her rest tenne daies, and then bring her to the male againe; if shee refuse the second time, you may take it for graunted, that she is filled already. Wherfore seeing it is knowne certain∣ly that a Mare goeth twelue months with young, it is an easie matter so to order the time of her copulation, The meanes to procure horsses to co¦pulation. that her foale may alwaies be deliuered in a warme and seasonable time of the year: for which cause there is an invention for stiring vp of the lust both in the male and female: the Hymenaean shepherds, by the sweetnesse of songs vpon their pipes, stirred vp their Horsses and Mares to copulation, but the more assured way is, to follow the di∣rection of Columella and Absyrtus, to prouoke them by naturall meanes, like as Buls and Kyne. And first of all for the male, giue him the taile of a Hart burned, mingled with wine, and annoint therewithall his stones and generall member, and so shal the dul Stallion be more prone to venery; also there is a kind of Satirium, which they giue to them in drinke, or the powder of a horsses stones: likewise if the female refuse, take shrimpes beaten softe with water (as thicke as hony) therewithal touch the nature of the Mare in hir purgation, and afterwards hold it to her Nose, or else take hennes dunge mixed with Rozen and Turpentyne, and annoynt the secrets of the Mare, which shall so far increase her lust, as it cureth the lothsomnesse better then the shrimps, and increaseth lust. But you must regard, that no leane and ill fauoured Mare be annointed, because the horse is quickly wearied from his lust, and so delighteth only to be tickled therewith with∣out doing any thing. Other againe doe first of all bring some vulger horsse to the Mare, who prouoketh and stirreth her to lust, and when he is neare the very facte of filling her, they lead her a∣way, to a more generous Stallion, to be couered by him: And so if none of these meanes do preuaile with her, they doe rub her secrets with a Nettle, and that causeth her to suffer the Horsse to enter. Democritus also saith that it is in our power to cause our Horsses to bring forth males or females; To ingender a male or fe∣male. for if we suffer them to couple when the North winde bloweth, or the third day before the full Moone, or bind his leaft stone, hee shall get a male; but if when the South wind bloweth, or three daies after the full Moone, or binde the right stone of the Horsse, it will proue a female. Also if at the time of copulation, the Horsse leape off from the Mare on the right side, it is a token it will be a male, but if on the left side, it wil be a female. Carnall copulation is most acceptable to Horsses, and lesse grieuous vnto them then to Neate, for there is no kind (man only excepted) that is so venereous and nimble in generation as is a Horsse or Mare. The males know their females with whom they liue, although they haue bine but a few daies together; and if strange females fall into their company, they expell them away by biting, feeding single and alone with their female by themselues; but if any male or other stone Horsse come within their walke, then presently they make force at him; if their fe∣male stir from them, they restraine her by biting: and in this time of their rage, they nei∣ther regard the rider, nor their aduersary, nor the bridle, nor cruell stripes, nor steep hills, nor rocks, or caues of the earth, if they wind the amorous sauour of their fellowes; accor∣ding to the saying of Virgill in these verses: Nonne vides, vt tota tremor pertentet equorum Corpora, si tantum not as odor attulit auras? Ac neque eos iam frena virum, nec verbera saeua, Non scopuli, rupes{que} cauae, atque obiect ae retardant Flumina, correptos vnda torquentia montes. It hath beene also receiued, that a barren mare shal conceiue if you take a bunch of leeks bruised small and put into a cup of Wine and twelue French flies called Cantarides in wa∣ter, put them two daies together into the genitall of a mare, like a Glyster, and afterwards put her to a Horsse anointing her secre s with the said ointment two seuerall times, when the horse leaps down from her; or else they take Nyter, Sparrows dung, Rozen, and Tur∣pentine, thrusting the same into the mares genitall, whereby it hath been proued, that fe∣cundity oftentimes followed. Also some vse Syler of the mountaines to procure conception in Mares and Cowes, and the true signe of conception is, when their nature (that is) the fluent humour, out of their secrets ceaseth for a month, or two, or three: and Pliny saith that when a mare is fil∣led she changeth her colour, and looketh more red, which is to be vnderstood not of her haire, but of her skinne, lips and eies, her haire standing more full then before. Then let them be seperated from the males, The ordring of a Mare with foale. Varro Palladius. exempting them from moist places, cold, and labour, for all these are enemies to her foaling, and cause abortement. Likewise they must not haue too much meate nor too little, but onely a tempe∣rate dyet and softe lodging, their better ordering is elegantly described in Virgill in these verses Non illas grauibus quisquamiug a ducere plaustras, Non saltu superare viam, sit passus & acri Carpere prata fuga: sluuiosque innare rapaces. Saltibus in vacuis pascant: & plena secundum Flumina, & viridissima gramine ripa: Spleuncaeque tegant: & sacra procubet vmbra. This is most certaine that if a Woman in her flowers, touch a mare with foale (or some∣times doe but see her) it causeth to cast her foale, if that purgation, be the first after her virginity: Orus. In like manner, if they smell of the snuffe of a candle, or eat bucke-mast or Gar∣tian. The Egyptians when they wil describe a woman suffering abortement, they picture a Mare treading vpon a Wolfe, for if a Mare kicke at a Wolfe or tread where a Wolfe hath troad, shee casteth her foale: If an asse couer a Mare, which a horsse hath formerly filled, there followeth abortment, but if a horsse couer a Mare, which an Asse hath former∣ly filled, there followeth no abortment, because the horsses seed is hotter then the Asses, If a Mare be sicke of abortment or foaling, Pollipody mingled with warme water giuen hir in a horne, is a present remedy. The Scythians when they perceiue their Mares to be quicke with foale, Aristotle. The time of their going with young. they ride vp∣on them, holding opinion that thereby, they cast forth their foales with lesse paine and difficulty. They carry their young one in their wombes as hath beene already said, twelue moneths, but sometimes they come at eleuen moneths and ten daies, and those are com∣monly males, for the males are sooner perfected in the womb then the females, and com∣monly the females are foaled at twelue months or ten daies, and those which tary longer are vnprofitable and not worth education. A Mare is most easily deliuered of her young among other beasts, and beareth most commonly, but one at a time, yet it hath been seen that twins hath proceeded from her. At the time of her deliuery, shee hath lesse purgati∣on of blood, then so great a molde of body can affoorde, and when she hath foaled, Aristotle shee deuoureth her seconds, and also a thing that cleaueth to her foales fore-heade, being a piece of blacke flesh called Hippomanes, neither doth shee suffer her young one to sucke vntill she haue eaten that, for by smelling thereunto, the young and old horsses, or other of that kind would fal mad, and this thing haue the imposters of the world, vsed for a Phyl∣tre or amorous cuppe, to draw Women to loue them, Virgill speaketh thus of it; Quaeritur & nascentis Equi de fronte reuulsus Et matris praereptus amor. And againe, Hinc demiem Hippomanes vero quod nomine dicunt Pastores. Lentum distillat ab inguine virus Hippomanes, quod saepe malae legere nouercae Miscueruntque herbas & non innoxia verba. This poison made into a candle ( Anaxilaus saith) in the burning thereof, there shall bee a presentation of many monstrous horsse-heads. There is verie great poison contained in this Hippomanes, for the Arcadian Phormis made a horsse of brasse at Olympia, and put Hi∣pomanes into the same, and if the horsses at any time had seene this brazen horsse, they weare so farre inraged with lust, that no halters or bands could hold them, but breaking all, runne and leaped vpon the said brazen horsse, and although it wanted a taile, yet wold they forsake any beautiful Mare and runne to couer it; neither when they came vnto it, and found it by their heeles to be sounding and hard brasse, woulde they despaire of co∣pulation, but more and more, with noise of mouth, rage, and endeuor of body, labor to leape vpon the same, althogh the slippery brasse gaue them no admission or stay of abod vpon the backe of that substance, neither could they be drawne from the saide brazen I∣mage, vntil by the great strength and cruel stripes of the riders they were forcibly driuen away. Some thinke this little peece of flesh to cleaue to the fore-head, others to the loynes, and many to the genitals: but howsoeuer it is an vnspeakeable part of Gods prouidence, to make the Mares belly a sepulchre for that poison, for if it should remaine in the males as in the females, the whole race of horsses would vtterly perish and be destroied throgh rage of lust, for which cause the keepers and breeders of horses; do diligently obserue the time of their Mares-foaling, and instantly cut off the same from the Colte, reseruing it in the hoofe a Mare, to procure the Stallions to carnal copulation, and the Colt from which they cut this piece of flesh, they sacrificed it, for it is manifest faith Elianus, that the Mare will neuer loue that foale, from whence shee hath not eaten and consumed this peece of flesh. And this poison is not onely powerful in brute beasts, but also in reasonable men, for if at any time by chance or ignorantly they tast heereof, they likewise fall to be so madde and praecipitate in luste, raging both with gestures and voice, that they caste their lustfull eyes, vppon euerie kind of Women, attempting wheresoeuer they meet them to rauish or ingender with them: and besides because of this oppression of their minde, their body consumeth and vadeth away: for three daies after the Colt is foaled hee can hardly touch the ground with his head. It is not good to touch them, for they are har∣med by often handling, onely it is profitable, that it be suffered with the damme in some warme and large stable, so as neither it be vexed with cold, nor in daunger to be oppressed by the Mare thorough want of roome. Also their hooues must be looked vnto, least their dung sticking vnto them burne them, afterward when it waxeth stronger, turne him out into the field with his damme, least the Mare ouer-mourne her selfe for want of hir foale, for such beasts loue their young ones exceedingly. After three daies let the Mare bee exercised and rid vppe and downe, but with such a pace as the foale may follow her, for that shall amend and encrease her milke. If the Colt haue soft hooues, it will make him runne more speedily vppon the hard ground, or else lay little stones vnder their feet, for by such meanes their hooues are hardned, and if that preuaile not, take swines grease, and brimstone neuer burned, and the stalkes of Garlicke bruzed and mingled all together, and therewithall anoint the hooues. The mountaines also are good for the breeding of Colts for two causes, first for that in those places their hooues are hardned, and secondly by their continual ascending and discending, their bodies are better prepared for induring of labour: And thus much may suffice for the educating and nursing of foales. For their weaning obserue this rule, first se∣perate them from their dams twentyfoure houres togither, in the next morning let them be admitted to sucke their belly full, and then remoued to be neuer more suckled: atv. moneths old begin to teach them to eat bread or hay, and at a yeare old giue them barly and bran, and at two yeares old, weane them vtterly. Of handling, taming, or breaking of Horsses. T Hey which are appointed to breake horsses, are called by the Graecians Eporedicae, Hipodami, and Hipocomi, the Latins Equisones, Arulatores, and Cociones, in Italian Io Cozone. Ab∣syrtus is of opinion that foales are to be vsed to hand, and to be begun to be tamed at eighteene moneths old, not to be backed but onely tied by the heade in a halter to a racke or maunger, so that it may not be terrified for any extraordi∣nary noise, for which cause they vse them to brakes, but the best time is at three yeares old, as Crescetiensis teacheth in many chapters, wherefore when they begin to be handled, let him touch the rough partes of his bodie, as the mane and other places, wherein the horsse taketh delight to be handled: neither let him bee ouer seaueare and Tyrannous, and seeke to ouercome the beast by stripes, but as Cicero saith, by faire meanes or by hun∣ger and famine. Some haue vsed to handle them sucking, and to hange vp in their presence bits and bridles, that so by the sight and hearing the gingling thereof in their eares, they might grow more familiar. And when they came to hand to lay vpon their backes a litle boy flat on his belly; and afterward to make him sit vpon him formally, holding him by the head, and this they do at three yeare old, but commit him to no labor vntill he be foure yeare old, yet domesticall and small horsses for ordinarie vse are tamed at two yeare olde, and the best time for the effecting heereof, is in the moneth of March. It is also good in riding of a young horsse to light often, and to get vp againe, then let him bring him home and vse him to the stable, the bottome whereof, is▪ good to be pa∣ued with round stones, or else planks of oake, strewing litter vpon it when he lieth down, that so he may lie soft and stand hard. It is also good to be regarded, that the plankes bee so laid, as the vrine may continually run off from them, hauing a little close ditch to re∣ceiue it, that so the horsses feet may not be hurt thereby, and a good maister of horsses must oftentimes go into his stable, that so he may obserue the vsage of this beast. The manger also ought to be kept continually cleane for the receiuing of his prouender, that so no filth or noisome thing be mingled therewith: there ought also to be partitions in it, that so euery beast may eat his owne allowance, for greedy horsses do not onely speedily rauen vp their owne meat, but also rob their fellowes. Others againe haue such weake stomackes that they are offended with the breath of their fellowes, and will not eate ex∣cept they eat alone. The racke also is to be placed according to their stature, that so their throat may not be too much extended, by reaching high, nor their eyes or head troubled, because it is placed too low. There ought also to be much light in the stable, least the beast accusto∣med to darkenesse, be offended at the Sunne light, and winke ouer much, being not able to indure the beams when he is led abroad, but yet the stable must be warme and not hot; for althogh heat do preseru fatnes, yet it bringeth indisgestion and hurteth a horsses na∣ture, therefore in the Winter time the stable must be so ordered, as the beast may not be offended or fall into diseases by ouermuch heat or suddaine cold▪ Ʋegetius In the Summer time let them lodge both night and day in the open aire. This also in stabling of your horsses must be auoided, namely the sties of Swine, for the stinke, the breath, the gruntling of hogs, is abhominable for horsses, and nature hath framed no simpathie or concorde betwixte the noble and couragious spirite of a horsse, and the beastlie sluggish condition of a Swine. Remoue also far awaie from your horsses stables all kind of fowle, which were woont to haunt those places, to gather vp the remnant-graines of their prouender, leauing be∣hind them their little fethers, which if the horsse licke vp in his meat, sticke in his throat, or else their excrements which procureth the loosenes of his bellie. It must also be regarded, that the stable must be kept neat, sweet, and cleane, Camerarius so as in absence of the horsse, it may notly like a place for swine: The instruments also, and imple∣ments thereof, such as are the horsse cloathes, the curri-combes, the mane-combes, sad∣dles and bridles be disposed and hung vp in order behind the horsse, so as it maie neither trouble him eating or lieng, nor yet giue him occasion to gnaw, eat, and deuour them to their owne damage or hurt, for such is the nature of some wanton horsses, to pul assunder and destroie whatsoeuer they can reach. They are therefore oftentimes to be exercised and backed, and principally to bee kept in a good diet, for want of food deiecteth the spirit of the noblest horsse, and also maketh the meane horsse to be of no vse; but on the contrary, a good diet doth not onelie make a meane horsse to be seruicable, but also continue the worth and value of the best, which thing Poets considered, when they fained that Arion the horsse of Neptune and some o∣thers were made by Ceres the Goddesse of corne, which any meane witted man may in∣tetpret to signifie, that by abundance of prouender the nature of horsses was so farre ad∣uanced aboue ordinary, that like the sonnes of the Gods they perform incredible things: whether therefore they eat chaffe, or hay, or grasse, or graine, according to the diuersi∣ties of countries, let it be wholesome, cleane, fresh, and sweet, without dust, grauel, mu∣stines, or euill smell. In the morning giue them barley or prouender, a little at a time in distinct or seueral portions, twice or thrice one after another, so as he may chew and eke disgest it thorogh¦ly, otherwise if he rauen it in, as he wil do hauing much at a time, he rendreth it in his dung whole and not disgested. About three houres after he hath eaten his prouender, giue him a little of hay, and three houres after that his dinners allowance of graine, as in the mor∣ning, and afterwards about two or three a clock hay againe, and then some drink: last of all giue him his allowance of prouender for Supper, with a bottle or two of hay, which ought to be more plentiful than the former seruings: & yet these rules are not to be vnder¦stood as though they might not be altered, for the times prefixed may be preuented if o∣casion require. Their best prouender is oats and barley, yet barly ingendreth the thinner and better blood, and therefore it is to be preferred, only the measure of the prouender is lefte to the discretion of the horsse-keeper, and there is no meate more wholsome for a horsse, than barly and chaffe, because it wil make him ful of life, and also able to indure la∣bor, yet not ouer fat. In England in many place they giue their horsses bread made of Fitches, beans, and pease. When one is to make a iourney on horsse-back, let him not giue his horse to much prouinder the noone before, but somewhat the more hay, and bread steeped in wine, and also let him serue him sooner at night than ordinary, that so the beast may take the more rest. There be which refuse to giue horsses wet prouender or steeped bread, because they conceiue that it will breed in them loathsomnesse of meat; but the truth is, a reasonable horsse-keeper preuenteth that mischeefe, and besides, the meat of a horsse is altogither so drie, that the beast himselfe is indangered to be sicke of that disease; and therefore it is as safe to giue him moistened foode sometimes, as well as to giue him bread mingled with salt. Camerarius When a horsse is weary or sweateth, let him not drinke nor eat prouender, but after he is walked a litle while, giue him hay, first of al couering him with a large cloath, and re∣member, that hay is not to be cast before a horsse, as it is out of the reeke, but first of all, it must be pulled, and shaken betwixt the handes, for the auoiding of dust, and other filth. Restrain the horsse as much as you may from eating the litter vnder his feet, for euen the best meat so defiled is vnholsome. It is also good sometimes to suffer him to picke vp his meat on the ground betwixt his forelegs, that will make his necke to grow thinner, lean∣ner, and more comely. Let his necke be fast bound in the stable with a Letherne collar, and bind with a manicle his fore-legge to the hinder leg on the contrary side, and so shal his legs be preserued in more health, because they cannot mooue out of their place but with difficulty. Concerning the drinke of horsses, something more is to be added in this place, and namely brackysh and troubled water, such as runneth softly, as in great pondes, is fittest for horsse, because that water, being hot and thicke nourisheth better, but the swift Wa∣ter is colder, R s ius and therefore more vnholsome, but yet in hot times (as in Summer) the sweet and clearer water is more conuenient if custome bee not against it. And because a horsse (except he drinke freely) can neuer be fat, let his mouth oftentimes be washed within with salt and wine, and that will make him eat and drinke more liberally: and yet the running water is more wholsome for horsses, because whatsoeuer is moueably fluent, is lesse subiect to poyson then that which standeth still; but if a horsse sweat or be weary, it is not safe to let him drinke any thing, except he first stale, for in such cases followeth di∣stention. And it is better to turne or lead forth your horsse to water, then to bring it vnto them. And if at any time necessity cause this to be done, then let the Water be very cleare and fresh. His stable or lodging ought to be ordered, as neither it offend him by cold in winter, nor yet thorough heat in Summer, for both these extremeties are pernicious: and ther∣fore when the weather is extreame colde, then must the horsses backe and belly be coue∣red with a cloath, and when on the contrary it exceedeth in heat, then must his litter be ta∣ken away. Also in heate he must bee couered with linnen to auiode flies, and in cold with woollen to helpe nature: likewise it is good toward night to picke, cleanse, and open his hooues, with some artificiall instrument, and to thrust into the hollow cow-dung, or in defect thereof horse-dung with a little strawe, that so he may not shake it out againe, but this is not good to be done euerie daye, but rather euery second day, and it is good to mingle therewith sewet or greace, or els a new laide Egge with warme shes. In auncient time they vsed not to shoo their horsses with yron, vntill the daies of Catullus, who remembreth this custome, saying: Ferream vt soleam tenaci in voragine mula: So that it seemeth that this deuise was first of al inuented for mules. These horsse-shooes, ought to be round like his feet, and not heauy, least the horsses nimblenes be thereby hin∣dered; & great care must be had in nailing or seting thē on, least the tender and fleshy part of the foot be thereby pierced. Pollux. Another charge of a horsse-keeper is to keepe his horsses lippes soft, tender, and gentle, so as he may more sencibly feele his bit: and for this cause let him often rub them with his hands and warme Water, and if neede require with oyle also: and in handling of a horsse this must be obserued for a generall rule, that neither he come to the horsse right before his face, nor behind his taile, because both these are dan∣gerous to the rider; least by his heeles or mouth hee harme him, but on his side he may safely set vpon him or handle his horsse, and when he leadeth him, he must likewise goe on his side. Likewise good and painefull dressing of a horsse is no small meanes to retaine him in in sound and perfect health: and therfore he must often be touched with the curry-comb, and afterward with a handfull of strawe, so as the hand may follow the stroke to lay the haire smooth: and their fashion was in old time to brush ouer their horsses with a little tone linnen instrument made like a sword, whereby they excusse all dust from the beast: and heerein it is wisedome to beginne at the head and mane, and so to descende to other parts, and to touch the horsses backe gently: he may wash the head and mane because it being so bony it is daungerous least the combe offend and greeue the beast, except it be layed on very tenderly, but it is not good to wash the legges, because daily washing softneth the hoofe by sliding downe of the Water, and therefore it is sufficient onely to stroke them downe with his hands. The neather part also of the belly is not to be kept ouer clean, for the more it is clensed with water, the more is the horsse pained therein: Camerarius when a horsse is dressed it is good to bring him out of the stable, that so in the open ayre hee may be tyed in a longer halter, and seeme to be at liberty, whereby he shall be brought to more cleannesse and tractable gentlenesse, standing vppon some smooth stones, till all the dust and loofe haires both by the combe and brush be driuen away, and in the meane time the stable be emptied, and this is to be performed before the horsses watering. You must also regarde the skin wherein the horsses yard runneth be kept cleane, for if it be stopped it hindereth vrine, and maketh the horsse sicke, and when your horsse is in dressing, let him haue before him no manner of meat either of hay or prouender. Let them be ledde to the Water twice a day, and wash therein both legges and bel∣ly, except in the Winter time, wherein it is not safe to wet the beast so often: and if there be in them any appearance of sicknesse and infirmity, or if you haue any purpose to giue vnto them any kinde of medicine, then must you altogether forbeare to Water them. Some vse to wash their horsses legges with warme wine-lees to refresh their ioyntes and sinnewes after hard iournies, which custome seemeth very allowable: Ʋegetius other vse in∣steed thereof warme dish-water out of the kitchin, and the backes they wash with colde water and salt. Vnderneath their tails and neare their yards, you shal find them in the Summer time to be much annoyed with flies, and therefore it is a needefull part of the horsse-keepers watch-fulnes to looke in those places and driue them away, for so his charge will take the better rest. And euermore there must be nourished a mutuall beneuolence betwixt the horsse and horsse-keeper, so as the beast may delight in the presence and person of his attendant; and for this cause he may be kept from hunger, wet litter, cold in the winter, and flies in the Summer; and furthermore a dilligent caution must be had, that the beast be not pro∣uoked thorough ouer much severity, for if the horsse by his keepers violence be often dri∣uen to his racke and maunger to auoid stripes, either he hurteth his shoulders or legges by his owne weight or force, or else groweth into a trembling at the presence of a man, and so neuer yeeldeth any louing obedience; or els faleth into some furious and vnreclai∣mable euill qualities. The master therfore ought often to enter into his stable, and take a view of his horsses vsage, whereby the beast wil quickly take notice of him, especially if he haue but one, for it is a great follie and peece of ill husbandry to trust Seruantes and not to ouer-see them. Cato was wont to say: Frons occipitio prior: That is, As the forehead is before the nape of the necke, meaning thereby that nature hath set him highest and formost, which should not hide himselfe, but take his place vp∣pon him and discharge it, for it is not safe or any part of wisdome, to see by another mans eies; or worke altogether by Deputies. Men must also be affraid of lending their horsses, for the Germans haue a pretty pro∣uerbe, that they will not trust their wiues at great feasts out of their sight, for commonly they learne some euill fashion or other more then they had before, and so much more horsses (after lending) returne home againe to their maisters with alteration of strength and quality. Of adorning and furnishing horsses. I Cannot approue them that cut off their horsses taile, or fore∣top; one receiued beginning from an ignorant perswasion of increasing the strength of the Horsses backe, The furnitur of a horse & his triming. and the other from an immagined comelines, by triming it with ribben or some deuised knot, or that it hindred the horsses sight. In the first, the beast is wronged and depriued of his helpe againste flies, and decency of his hinder parts, and in the second na∣ture acused, for not adorning the horsses forhead with more gawdy and variable coloured hairs, and prouiding a bunch of haire to weaken his eyes: but neither of these are tollerable, for a wise man once to ima∣gine, and therefore I will not spend any more time to confute this vaine adorning of Horsses. Let the horsse-keeper take heed that he harme not the beast when he putteth on his bridle, for a little negligence quickly bringeth a great offence, by touching, wringing, and oppressing any tender part in the horsses head or mouth. He must alway put on his bridle on the left side, and if the horsse of his owne accord do not open his mouth to the bit, then musthe gently open his mouth with one finger, and so put it vppon him; and if by that meanes he open not his mouth, then presse or wring his lip vpon his great canine tooth, which thing causeth any horsse to open his mouth. Also it must be regarded that the horsse in leading be not drawne after you, for so will he be made hard headed, vnwilling to follow: againe his cheekes must not be pinched by the bridle, least the skin grow sencelesse, and also it must not hange long or loose in his mouth, for so he will be alway biting his bit, and giue lesse obedience to his Rider. Camerarius writeth that he hath seene some put salt vpon their bits, whereof the horse licking or tasting, became more willing to take it into his mouth: and for the better per∣formance heereof, it is necessary to obserue by often triall, what kind or fashioned bitt best beseemeth and fitteth the horsses mouth, and finding it, keepe him thereunto conti∣nually: and when it is put on, neither wring his cheekes, or let him rowle it betwixt his teeth. The saddle also must be so fastned to his backe, as that it may not turne or rowle vpon the same; wherefore he which layeth it thereupon, most come on the left side, and gent∣ly without violence or noise, set it vpon the beast: so as neither girths, peytrill, sturrops, trappings, or crupyard, fall betwixt the backe and saddle, neither couering therewith the horsses wither, nor yet touching his hips or loynes. First of all let the peytrill on the breast be buckled, then the girths in order neere the forelegs, not vpon the belly, for vpon the belly they wil be sliding off, and that is against the rules of riding; for Bene equitant qui bene cingunt, that is to say; they ride well which bind fast: and this ought to be done in an open place, where both the rider and the horse may haue more liberty: wherewithal a generous and great stomacked beaste is much de∣lighted: neither must he be tyed or drawne too hard till the rider be seated. Looke also often to the girthes, that they wring not the sides, or pul of the skin. Of riding and sitting on horsebacke. W Hen you are to get vp and mount on horesebacke, take hold on the lo∣wer part of the bridle neere the bit, with the lefte hand, with such a di∣stance as may both keepe him from rising, nor giue him offence if you take aduantage to get into the saddle, and with the right hand take the raines on the toppe of the shoulders and the mane, and so hold them as you giue no checke to the Horses mouth in mounting: there are other rules for this among riders, wherewithall I will not meddle, onely it is good to vse your horsse to backing, both sadled and bare, aswel from the plaine ground, as from blocks and risings, inuented for the ease of man. Therefore before you goe to Horssebacke, first stroke your Horsse and make much of him with gentle words, or other conuenient sound which the Horsse vnderstandeth, and so will he stand more willingly til you be on his backe: for this thing, there is in Plutarch an excellent story of Alexander the great, when Bucephalus was first of all presented to his father King Phillip, by a Thassalian (called Phillonix :) For when the King was perswaded to go forth into the fielde to try the qualities of this beast, which was so highly cōmended for rare partes, and valued at such a price, as none but a King might yealde for him▪ then the Horsse beganne to snort, and kicke, and to admit no man to come vnto him within the length of the rains, but kept aloft like a wild and vntamed Horsse; yealding no obedience to voice or other signes of the riders: whereat the King fel exceeding angry, and bid them lead away the vnruly and vntamed Horse: Alexander being present, complained of the ignorance and fearefulnesse of the riders, and that they were the cause why such a gene∣rous and gallant beast was no better manned. At the hearing wherof, King Phillip smiled, and yet so carried himselfe as though he had not heard the words of his Sonne, vntill A∣lexander repeated his saying the second time; whereunto his father replyed, what (sir Boy) will you make your selfe more skilfull then these old cunning riders? will you lay on them an imputation of feare and ignorance? yes (said Alexander ) I will aduenture to handle this Horsse better then any other: yea but (saide Phillip ) what punishment then wilt thou vn∣dergoe if thou faile and performe not what thou hast said? What punishment (said Alex∣ander ) why I will giue them the price of the Horsse: Whereat the King laughed and strok vp the Wager, and so had Alexander the raines of the Horsse deliuered to him, who pre∣sently turned him about against the Sun-rising, that so he might not bee terrified with the shaddow of the beholders, and so led him vp and downe softly two or three turnes, and at last wan the Horsse to hand, which he gently stroked and applauded: and when he had got∣ten perfect intelligence and vnderstanding of the Horsses stomacke, he cast off his cloake, and addressed himselfe to mount on his backe, so holding the raines and bearing his hand and whole body as he did not checke or pinch the Horsses mouth: so he inclined him first of al to lay away his stirred and angry minde, and afterward paced him to and fro gently which the Horsse indured: At last he put Spurs vnto him, and made him runne, leap, car∣rier, and curuet, to the terror at the first of all the beholders, & afterward to their singular admiration and praise of himselfe: which caused the company or traine to applaude this fact, and forced the old man his father, to send forth teares for ioy: and when Alexander desended from his Horsse, hee could not containe himselfe, but he must needes goe kisse and embrace such a Sonne; whereby it is manifest, that when a man is to ride on a gene∣rous spirited Horsse, hoshal bend him to endure the burthen by gentlenesse and familiari∣ty, so as the beast may still know and loue his rider. Likewise when the maister mounteth, it is requisit that the seruant be on the other side of the horsse to hold the stirrop, for so shall he get vp more surely and set himselfe mor softly. Some Horsses are taught to bend their knees to take vp their aged and sick Maisters, Xenophon. that so they may be the lesse offended in ascending to their backs, and this custom (saith Pollux ) did first of al begin among the Persians. The ancient Germans were so singularly exercised in Horsmanship, that standing vpon the ground and holding a Speare of launce in their handes, they mounted without other stirrop or vantage vppon their Horsses backs; and not onely when they were ordinarily attired in common garments, but then also, when they were armed (tho Iulius Caesar take from them all glory of chiualry) yet now adaies the inuention of Saddles with stirrops, is most easie both for Horsse and Horsseman, being then better the Pelethronian inuention time. When the Rider is in his Saddle, and is well seated, he must not sit as in a Chaire or cha∣riot, bended together, but rather keepe his body vpright, onely bowing outwardly his knees, for so shal he be better able to defend himselfe, or offend his aduersary; for he must rather seeme to stand then to sit on horsebacke. The Rider or maister of Horsses must spare his Horsse in the heate of Summer, (about Dog daies) and in the colde of Winter, Russius and neuer at any time to ride past the twylight of the euening. The Horsse being empty, is more prone to make water then being full, and therefore must not be hindered in that desire: and alway after his staling, ride him not too fast, vntil his nerues which were extended to let forth the vrine be contracted, set∣led and drawne together againe. If in the winter time a horsse be to passe ouer a foord of water (which wil ascend vp aboue his belly) let him stale first of al, Absirtus least he fall into the strangury, and also be a little eased of his loade. There is no beast that reioyseth more in celerity and swiftnesse then a horse, because so soone as he is turned out of hand, he instantly runneth away speedily, and doth walke soft∣ly as at other times: and this is a pleasure to them, except when they are prouoked aboue their desires: and the counsel of Xenophon when you are to ride fast or for a wager, is this; bend the vpper part of the body forward, stretching out the hand that carrieth the raines; now drawing it in, and then letting it at length againe; and therefore it is good in such ca∣ses to vse short raines, and if the Horsse in his course stretch forth the raines of his owne accorde, then is it a signe of an vnskilfull Rider, or of a weake and tireable horsse. Pollux. Adde not Spurs but in great necessity, but guide and prouoke him with voice and riding rod, for quick and good metled Horsses, are by the Spur made fierce; and gentle natu∣red beastes made sluggards like Asses, which by often beating seem to neglect and dispise stripes. You must also shorten and lengthen your iournies and times of ridings, so as they may neither be certaine to the beast, nor yet ouer long; and specially after a long iourney, take a shorter if you ride vpon the same horsse. First of all let him be vsed to plaine and equal waies, and if he be to leape or goe vppe hill, it was a precept of the old Graecians, that then the Rider must lay the raines in his necke. If the Horsse at any time be either more fierce or sluggish then ordinary, he may be holp by these meanes. Wildenesse and fiercenesse of Horsses, is like to anger and rage in men, and therefore occasions of offence in word and deede must be auoided: therefore assoone as the Rider is vpon his backe, let him rest a little before he set forward, and then also let the horsse moue but his own pace: for as men are offended with sudden violence and imperious gestures, so also are horsses: but if the horsse being stirred to his race, bee more forward and whot then ordinary, he must be gently restrained by the bridle; and it is better to qualifie their rage in long and spacious direct iournies, then in often wind∣dings and turnings. But if any man be so simple as to thinke that by length of iourney or race, his horsse wil be more meeke, because he may be tyred, hee deceiueth himselfe, for as rage in man inuenteth hurtful reuenge, and turneth into malice by continuance, so also in horsses it procureth a headlong ruine (if it be not preuented) both to horsse and rider: and there∣fore if your horsse be of a generous spirit, neuer prouoke him to ferocity, for as they are wilde and fierce, so are they wicked and harmefull. It is also better to vse light and gentle bridles then heauy and sharpe, except the rider can by his art so frame the sharpe, as the gentle bitte: and also the rider must so frame himselfe in his art of ryding, that in the commotion of his Horsse, hee may not touch any member or part of him, but onely his backe whereupon he sitteth. He must also learne his different termes, to incite and stir vp his Horsse to run forward, which the Graecians call ( Clogmos ) or else to restraine him and keepe him in which they call ( Poppysmus ) the one closeth the lippes, and the other toucheth the palat. If the Horsse be fearefull of any thing, you must shew the thing to him plainly, that so by custom he may learne not to be skittish, and let him smell thereunto, till he learne not to be afraid, but if men beate them, they do but feare them more; for while they are so ill handled, they suspect that the things wherof they are afraid are the cause of their stripes. In like sort when they go on the one side, or turne back againe, it is good to vse the spurs, because they encrease their terror and peruersenesse; and therefore as peaceable encou∣ragement and friendly perswasion is the best meanes to perswade a man in his feare, the like course must be taken with a Horsse, that so he may goe straight on without doubt or trembling; and learne not to account any thing horrible to his nature. When a Horsse is so tyred and wearied in his iourney that a man would iudge him vnfit for any labour, take off his Saddle and burthen, and put him into some stable or greene fielde, where he may tumble and towle ouer and ouer, and he shall easily recouer. In ancient time, if horsses were to be trauailed through snow, they made them bootes of sackcloth to weare in their iourney. Of the disposition of horsses in generall. A Mong the flockes or heardes of Horsses, there is not a Cap∣taine or leader going before or gouerning the residue, as a∣mong Oxen, Sheepe, and Elephants; because the nature of these is more instable and moueable it being a swift and high spirited beast, and therefore hath receiued a body furnished with such members as are apt to be swaied by such spirit: for Lactantius truly obserueth in them a desire of glory, because after victory, the conquerours exsult and reioyce, but the conquered or ouercome, mourne and hange downe their heades: which thinge Virgill expresseth in this verse; Insultare solo, & gressus glomerare superbos. But more plainely Ouid, the triumph of the conquering horsse, saying: Hic generosus honos & gloria maior equorum Nam capiunt animis palmā, gaudentque triumpho Seu septem spatijs circo mexuere coronam. Nonne vides victor quanto sublimius altum Attollat caput, & vulgi se venditet aura, Celsaue cum caeso decoratur tergaeleone Quam tumidus, quanto{que} venit spectabilis actu: Compes atque solum, generoso concita pulsu, Vngula sub spolijs grauiter redemitis opimis. And Pliny affirmeth that when they are ioyned together in chariots, they vnderstand theyr encouragements of glory and comendation: and therefore there is not any beaste of so high a stomach as a horsse. Of the naturall disposition of horsses. THey loue wet places and baths, for which cause they are called Philolutra, they al∣so loue musicke as hath beene already declared, and the whole hoaft or Army of the Sybarites, taught their Horsses to daunce at the sound of a Pipe: and Coelius writeth heereof in this manner; So great (saith he) was the riot and wantonnesse of the Sybarit , that at their common feastes they brought in horsses to daunce before men; which thing being knowne by the Crotoniatae, they offered them Warre, and agreed vppon the fight: whereupon, in the day of battell, the Crotoniats brought with them diuers▪ Pipers and Minstrils, who vppon a signe giuen to them, sounded their instruments, whereupon the Sibaritan horsses came running & dancing among their aduersaries, and so betraied them selues and their riders to the enemy. The like story is reported by Athaeneus, of the people (called Cardiani ) for they also taught their Horsses to daunce vpon their hinder Legges, and to worke many straunge feates with their forefeete, at the hearing of certaine measures played vpon Pipes. The Bisaltans waged Warre against the Cardians, and they had to their Captaine a certaine man (called Onaris ) who when hee was a Boy was sold to Cardia, and there hee serued with a Barber: In the time of his seruice he oftentimes heard, that the Oracle had foretold, A History. how the Cardians should be ouercome by the Bisaltans, and therefore he to pre∣uent the worst ranne away from his maister, and came home safe to Bisalta his owne coun∣try, and was by his countrey men created Captaine of all their warlike forces: he vnder∣standing what trickes the Cardians taught their Horsses in dancing, brought out of Cardis certaine Pipes, and taught diuers Bisaltans to sound and play the measures vpon them, which the Cardians taught their Horsses: whereupon when as they ioyned battell with the Cardian Horsses (for all the force of the Cardians lay in their Horses) he commanded his piping Bisaltans to sounde their musicke, which the Horsses vnderstood, who presently stood vp vpon their hinder legges, and would not fight any more or goe any further, so as they were ouerthrowne by their aduersaries. Solinus They haue also a singular pleasure in publike spectacles; and therefore haue beene ob∣serued to be prouoked not only by pipes or such instrumentall musicke, but also by songs or vocall harmony, by variety of colours, and by burning Torches: Dion also Writeth that he saw a Horsse taught to know and to do reuerence to a king. And Textor affirmeth that he saw a Horsse at Paris at the triumphs, tilt, and Turna∣ments made for the marriage of Lewes the twelueth to Mary, a Lady of Brittaine, which being commaunded by his Ryder to salute the Queene, presently did bend both his knees vnto her, and then rose againe running away as fast as a bird could flye. Homer seemeth also to affirme that there are in Horsses diuine qualityes, vnderstanding things to come, for being tyed to their mangers they mournd for the death of Patroclus, and also fore-shewed Achilles what should happen vnto him: for which cause Pliny saieth of them, that they lament their lost maisters with teares, and foreknow battailes, Virgill writeth thus of the horsse of Pallas: Post bellatrix equus, positis insignibus Aethon Lachrymans, quisque humectat grandibus ora. Accursius affirmeth, that Caesar three daies before he died found his ambling Nag weeping in the stable, which was a token of his ensewing death, which thing I should not beleeue, except Tranquillus in the life of Caesar, had related the same thing, and he addeth moreo∣uer, that the Horsses which were consecrated to Mars for passing ouer Rubricon, being let to run wilde abroad without their maisters, because no man might meddle with the horses of the Gods, were found to weepe aboundantly and to abstaine from all meat. Whereof their could be no cause giuen, but the loue of their former maisters. It is also reported of Rodatus, a captain to Charls the great, who after the death of the Emp. was made a Monk, his horse would neuer suffer any to come on his back except his maister, who likewise had abstained from riding many yeares: But it happened that certaine Pagans, brake in vpon the said monastery, whereupon poore Rodatus went vnto his horse, who after many years discontinuance, willingly tooke vp his aged maister vpon his back, and so carried him vntil he riumphed ouer his aduersaries, and no maruaile for dogs and horses are most louing to men, if they be brought vp carefully, and liberally, they recompence the good turnes of their benefactors. It is obserued in the nature of horses that they seldome hurt a man or child, except in their madnes, yet are there malitious horses, as well as men. It is reported by Pliny and Tzetzes, that when a foale hath lost his dam, the residue of the Mares which giue suck, bring it vp, and that they are seldom found at variance, except the barren mares pull away the foales from the naturall dams. For there is no creature so louing to their young ones, as are Mares, neither any so desi∣rous of young: for which cause, when they are barren themselues, they labour to steale them away from others. They which were wont to runne rases, would performe it vpon Mares, Aristotle. newly deliuered of Foals, they tyed vp the Foals at home, and led the Mares to the begining of the race, making the end thereof at the Foales stable; and so putting the Beast forward, she run∣neth homewardes more speedily for the remembrance of her Foale. Of the feare of Horsses and their enemies in nature. H Orsses are afraid of Elephants in battaile, and likewise of a Cam∣mell, for which cause when Cyrus fought against Cra sus, he ouer∣threw his Horsse by the sight of Camels, for a Horsse cannot a∣bide to looke vpon a Camell. If a Horsse tread in the foot-path of a Wolfe, he presently falleth to be astonished; Likewise, if two or more drawing a charriot, come into the place where a Wolfe hath troad, they stand so still as if the Charriot and they were frozen to the earth, sayth Aelianus and Pliny. Aesculapius also affirmeth the same thing of a Horsse, treading in a Beares footsteps, and assigneth the reason to be in some secret, betwixt the feete of both beastes. We haue shewed already, that if a Mare strike a Wolfe, Orus. or treade in the footsteppes thereof, she presently casteth her Foale; and therefore the Egyptians, when they signi∣fie a Woman suffering abortement, picture a Mare kicking a Wolfe. The Dextanian Horsses being not gelded, dare fight with Lyons, but being gelded, like al other Horsses, Oppianus they are so afraid of Lions, that no stripes, nor Spurs, is able to bring them in their pre∣sence, the Caropion Horsses excepted. Al kind of Swine are enemies to Horses, the Estridge also is so feared of a Horse, Cardan. that the Horsse dares not appeare in his presence. The like difference also is betwixt a Horsse and a Beare. There is a bird which is called Anclorus which neyeth like a Horsse, flying a∣bout, the Horsse doth many times driue it away, but because it is somewhat blind, and cannot see perfectly, therfore the horsse doth oftentimes ketch it, and deuoure it, hating his owne voice in a creature so vnlike himselfe. It is reported by Aristotle, that the Bustard loueth a Horsse exceedingly, for seeing other Beastes feeding in the pastures, dispiseth and abhorreth them, but as soone as euer it see∣eth a Horsse, it flyeth vnto him for ioy, although the Horsse run away from it: Aelianus. and there∣fore the Egyptians, when they see a weake man driuing away a stronger, they picture a Bustard flying to a horsse. Horsses are also taught to leape, if a man take him by the rains, and go ouer the ditch before him, holding him fast, and pulling him to him. But if he be vnwilling, then let another come behinde him and strike him with a Whip, or with a rod, so will he leape ouer without delay; and thus when you haue vsed him to leape empty, like∣wise accustome him loaded. First ouer smaller and then ouer greater hedges. But at the beginning let him leape in softe ground, and being wel practized in harder, and when he beginneth to leape, let the Rider put Spurres vnto him, for so will he performe his leape with more safety to himselfe and the rider; and by custome hee may leape, and runne as wel downe the hil as vp hil; and therefore the Persians, and Nodrisians vse and accustome their Horsses to run both down hil, and vp hil. These Epethits following, do serue and expresse the nature of Horsses: ful of stomach, generous, magnanimious, strong, ardent, sharpe, couetous, fierce, bolde, threatening, terrible, foaming; such were the Horsses of Arcauania, Argose, Mysene, Aria, Elis, Epid. Spaine, Thesalt, Farsalis, of which country was Bucephalus, the Horsse of Alexander. Balla∣sia, a prouince addicted to Mahomet, hath many of these excellent, great, and swift horsses, whose hoofes are so hard, that they neede no yron shooes, although they trauaile ouer rocks and mountaines. The Arabians also haue such horses, and in the kingdom of Senega, they haue no breed of Horsses at all, by reason of the heate of their Countrey, which doth not onely burne vp all pasture, but also cause Horsses to fa l into the strangury; for which cause they doe buy Horsses very deare, vsing in stead of hay, the stalkes of Pease dryed and cut asunder, and Millet seede, in stead of Oates, wherewithall they grow exceeding fat, and the loue of that people, is so great to Horsses, that they giue for a Horsse furnished, nine bond-slaues, or if it please them well, fourteen; but when they haue bought their Horsses, they send for Witches, and obserue therein this ceremony. They make a burning fire with stickes, putting therein certain fuming Herbes, after∣wardes they take the Horsse by the bridle, and set him ouer this smoking fire, annointing him with a very thinne oyntment, muttering secretly certaine charmes, and afterwardes hanging other charmes about their Necke in a red skinne, shut them vp close for fifteene daies together: then did they bring them forth, affirming that by this meanes, they are made more valiant, and couragious in war. The loue and knowledge of Horsses to men. A Nd to this discourse of Horsses belongeth their nature, ei∣ther of louing or killing men. Of the nature of Alexanders Horsse before spoken off called Bucephalus, is sufficiently said, except this may be added, that so long as he was naked and without furniture, he would suffer any man to come on his backe, but afterwardes being sadled and furnished, hee could endure none but Alexander his maister: For if any o∣ther had offered to come neare him, for to ride him, he first of all terrified him with his neighing voice, and afterwardes troad him vnder foot if he ran not away. When Alexander was in the Indian Warres, and ryding vpon this Horsse in a certaine battaile, performed many valiant acts, and through his own improuidence, fell into an ambush of his foes, frō which he had neuer bin deliuered aliue, but for the puisancy of his Horsse, who seeing his maister beset with so many enemies, receiued the Dartes into his owne body, and so with violence pressed through the middest of his enemies, hauing lost much bloude, and receiued many woundes, ready to die for paine, not once staied his course till hee had brought his maister the King safe out of the battell, Gillius and set him on the ground; which be∣ing performed in the same place hee gaue vppe the ghoast and dyed, (as it were com∣forting himselfe with this seruice) that by his owne death hee had saued the life of such a King: for which cause, after Alexander had gotten victory, in that very place where his Horsse died he built a citty and called it Bucephalon. Textor. It is also reported that when Limus the Emperour would haue had his Horsses to teare in pieces his Daughter, because she was a Christian, he himselfe was by one of them bit∣ten to death. Neocles the Sonne of Themistocles perished by the biting of a Horsse: neither heerein onely is the nature of Horsses terrible, because also they haue been taught to teare men in pieces: for it is said that Busiris and Diomedes did feede their Horsses with mans flesh, and therefore Hercules tooke the like reuenge of Diomedes, for hee gaue him to his Horsses to be eaten: of Diomedes were these verses made, Vt qui terribiles programen habentibus herbis, Impius humano viscere pauit equos. The like also is reported of Glaucus (the son of Sysiphus ) who fed Horsses with mans flesh at Potnia a city of Boeotia, and afterward when he could make no more prouision for them, they deuoured their maister: whereof Virgill writeth thus; Et mentem venus ipsa dedit quo tempore Glauci, Potniades malis membra absumpsere quadrigae. But this is thought a fiction, to expresse them which by feeding and keeping of Horsses, consume their wealth and substance: and thus much for the natural inclination of Horses. Of seuerall kindes of Horsses. T Here be seuerall kinds of horsses which require a particu∣lar tractate by themselues, and firste of all the martiall or great warlicke horsse, which for profit the poet coupleth with sheepe: Lanisierae pecudes & equorum bellica proles. The parts of this horsse are already described in the Stalli∣on, the residue may be supplied out of Xenophon and Oppi∣anus. He must be of a singular courage and docibility, with out maime, fear , or other such infirmity. He must be able to run vp and down the steepest hils, to leap, and bite, and fight in battail, but with the direction of his rider: for by these is both the strength of his body and mind discouered; and aboue al, such a one as will neuer re∣fuse to labor, though the day be spent: wherefore the rider must first look to the instituti∣on and first instruction of his horsse, for knowledge in martiall affaires is not naturall in men or horsses, and therefore except information and practise adorne nature, it cannot be, but either by feare or heady stubbornes, they will ouerthrow themselues and their ri∣ders. First of all they must not be geldings, because they are fearefull, but they must bee such as wil reioyce and gather stomacke at the voice of musicke, or trumpets, and at the ringing of armour: they must not be afraid of other horsses, and refuse no combate, but be able to leape high and far, and rush into the battell, fighting (as is said) with heeles and mouth. The principall things which he must learne are these: Xenophon. first to haue a lofty and flexible necke, and also to be free, not needing the spur; for if he be sluggish and need often agi∣tation too and fro by the hand of the rider, or els if he be full of stomacke and sullen, so as he will do nothing but by flattery and faire speeches, he much troubleth the mind of the rider: but if he run into the battell with the same outward aspect of body, as he doth vn∣to a flocke or company of Mares, with lowde voice, high necke, willing minde, and great force, so shall he be both terrible to looke vppon, and valiantly puissant in his combate. Wherefore the rider must so cary his hand, as the reynes may draw in the horsses necke, and not so easily, as in a common trauelling gelding, but rather sharply to his greeuance a little, by which he wil be taught as it were by signes and tokens to fight, stand still, or run away. The manner of his institution may bee this: The institu∣tion of a war¦licke horsse. after the dressing and furnishing of your horsse as aforesaid, and likewise the backing, first of al moue, stir, or walk your horsse gent¦lie, vntil he be wel acquainted with the cariage of your hand and whole body, and after∣ward accustome him to greater and speedier pace or exercise, vse him also to run longer races, and also by drawing in your hand to stay or stop suddenly: for there are horsses so instructed that they can stay themselues in their speediest course vpon an instant, without any circumambulation, shaking off the violence of their course, like an ordinary trotting nag, by mounting vp a little with their forefeet. And alway it is to be remembred that after the mounting on horsse-backe, you must first of al begin on the left hand, bending your hand that waie, and also to the right hand when you would haue your horsse to turne on that side. And aboue all other things horsses are deligh ed w crooked, bending and round courses, such as are in circles and Rings, and he must be accustomed other horsses, leauing them behind him, Men haue pe¦rished by rash¦nes in riding. and likewise turning toward them and making at them with his face to them: but headlong and preci∣pitate courses, such as hunters make without guiding body, hand or horsse, are euermore to be avoided, for manie men haue perished from their horsses, as the Poets witnesse of Nipheus Leucagus, Liger, Clonius, Remulus, Amycus. And also among the Historiographers. Agenor, Fulco of Ierusalem, Phillip, son of Ludonicus Crassus king of France, and Bela king of Pannonia. Of Horsse-men, and the orders of Chiualry and Knight-hood. T He principal horsse-men of the world celebrated in stories, for training, ruling, and guiding their horsses according to the art of warre, may for the dignity of Knight-hood (wher withall they are honoured) and from whom that Equestrial order is deriued, be recited in this place. It is manifest by S ∣pontinus that the Romaine Equestrial order, was in the mid∣dle betwixt the Senatours and the common people, The honour of horsse∣manship. for at the first the e was no difference betwixt Equites and Indices, for both of them had for a badge, cognisaunce, or note of their honour, power to weare a ring of gold, and in the con∣sulship of Marcus Cicero the title was turned to Equestriall or name of a knight or man at Armes, by that meanes reconciling himselfe to the Senate, and affirming that he was de∣riued from that order, and from that time came the Equester ordo, being as is said before the people, and recorded after the people, because of the latter creation thereof: yet had they not their beginning at this time, but onely now they firste came into the orders of the common-wealth; for they were called ( Celeres ) vnder Romulus, of one Celer, who at the command of Romulus slew Remus, and he was made the chief iudge of three hundred. They were afterward called Flexumines, eyther because they swayed the minds of them whom they iudged, or else which is more probable, because of martialling and instruct∣ing their horsses for war: afterward because they tooke a great company of horsse-men, without all aide of footmen, Festus. at the citty Trossulum in Thuscia, they were called Trossulai, and Trossuli, and yet some ignorant persons honored with the title of Trossuli in remem∣brance of that victory, were ashamed thereof as vnworthy their dignities. They were forbidden to weare purple like as were the Senators, and their golden Ring was a badge both of peace and war. The maister of the horsse among the Romains called by the Graecians Hipparchus, and by the Latines Magister Equitum, was a degree of honor next to the Dictator, and Marcius the Dictator made the first maister of horsse-men, who was called Spurius, Suidas. and set him in place next to himselfe. These Equestrial men or knights of state were wont to be publicans at the least, and it was ordained that no man should be called into that order, except both he, his father, and grand-father, were free men, and were worth in value, twenty thousand pound; Turon and Tiberius made this law, but after¦ward it grew remisse and not obserued, whereby both bond men and Scribes were rewar∣ded with this dignity from the Emperour, for Orations and pleasing speeches: yet were the Decuriall iudges chosen out of this rank; for indeed by primary and institution, they were the flower and seminary of the Roman gentry. Pliny complaineth that this dignity which was wont to be a reward for military men, who had aduentured their liues for the honor of their country, was now bestowed corruptly, and for mony vpon meane bribing persons. It should seeme they had euery one a horsse of honor giuen to him for his note, for if one of them had grown fat and vnweeldy, not able to manage and gouern this hors, it was taken from him. And Cato took away the horse from Scipio A iaticus, because he had intercepted mony, & from hence cam the terms of their allowance, as Equistrae aes, for that mony which was paid for a horse to one kni. & pararium aes, for a double fee to an Equest∣rial man. The Atheni∣an orders. Among the Athenians the highest order was of them which were medimni, which had plowd so much land as had sowd of corn, & the next de∣gree were their Equites, knights, or horssemen, because for the defence of their citty, they were able euery one to norish a horsse of war. There wer of these in ancient time but 6. C▪ and afterward they were increased vnto 1200. and the sacrifices which wer made for they pomps and triumphs, Aristophanes Coelius Suidas. were called Hippades : and they had liberty to norish their long ha which was forbidden to other men, and their tax to the sacrifice was at the least halfe a ta∣lent, (which is at the least 300. crowns) and this sacrifice was made for the health of thei horsses: there were two maisters created ouer these, to wage and order war, and ten in∣ferior gouernours or wardens to look to the prouision and norishing of horsses. Among the Lacedemonians they had foure gouernments. The monarchy for the kings, the Ari∣stocraty for the old men, the Olygarchie for their Ephori or commissioners, the Democratye for their young men, with gouerned, managed, and instructed horsses. Nestor that anci∣ent knight was commended for this skill, and had therefore giuen him the title of Hip∣potes. Among the Chalcidensians there was not a rich man but they took him into this order, and the Cretians likewise did euer highly account hereof, and made it their highest degree of honor, for euen the Romans did sometimes gouern whole prouinces with no other then these, and Egipt had this in peculiar, that no other order, no not a Senator might be pre∣sident or gouern among them. The Achaeans had this degre in high estimat, like as the Ger¦mans their Bataui or states. The Cittizens of Capua were and are disguised with a perpetu∣ity of this honour, because in the Latines war, they did not reuolt from the Romans, and among all other the Gaditan wer most honored herewith, for at one time and for one bat¦tel they created 400. This title hath spred and adornd it selfe with many more degrees, as that among the French Caballarij and Equites aurati, and such as are knights of Ierusalem and diuers other, some for religion, and some for feats of armes: whereas the Persians v∣sed a certain kind of garment in warre, called Manduas, from hence commeth the knights vper garment to be called a mantel, for al the Persians were horssemen. The noblest hor∣ses and such as coulde run most speedily and swiftly were ioyned together in chariots for races, courses, spectacles, games, and combats, for great values and prizes. —Nempe volucrem Sic laudamus equum: facili cui plurima palma Feruet, & exultat rauco victoria circo. And againe Ouid saith: Non ego nobiluim venio spectator equorum And Horace: N c te nobilium fugiat certamen equorum Primus in certamine. There was one Anniceris a Cyrenian most skilful in this practise, and according to the vain humors of men, was not a little proud heerof, and for his loue to Plato would needs in the Academy shew him and his schollers his skill, and therefore ioyning his horsses and cha∣riot togither, made many courses with such an euen and delineat proportion, that his hor∣ses and wheeles neuer wandered a hair bredth from the circle or place limited, but alway kept the same road and footsteps, whereat euery one marueiled: but Plato reproued the dubble diligence and vaine practise of the man, saying to him in this manner: It cannot be, that a man which hath trauelled and laboured so much in an art or skil of no worth or vse in the common wealth, that euer he can addict his mind to graue, serious, and profi∣table businesse, for while he applyeth all his parts and powers of body and soule to this, he is the lesse able and more vnapt to those thinges which are alone more worthy of admi∣ration. The ancient custome was to vse other mens horsses in this combate, and therefore in the funerall of Patroclus, Homer bringeth in Menelaus, vsing the horsse of Agamemnon. There were foure seuerall places wherein these games of horsses and chariots were wont to bee obserued and kept, and they were called after these places, Olympia, Pythia, Nemea, and Isthmia, and of all these the Olympiads were the cheefe whereof all stories are full, for they were celebrated in Olympus euery fifte yeare inclusiuelie, that is, after the end of euery fourth yeare. The writers of Chronicles do agree that the games of Olympus were first instituted by Hercules in the 2752. yeare of the world, beginning the worlde from Noahs flood, and they beginne to record and number the first Olympiad to be about the 3185. yeare of the world, about seuenteene yeare before the building of Rome. There were of these Olympiads, 328. and the last of these by computation or account fell abovt the yeare of our Lord 534. after the birth of Iesus Christ, the blessed Sauior of the world. The perfection of these games began the twenty fiue Olympiad, at what time Pagondas the Theban was pronounced victor: for then were swift horsses brought into the games, and were called ( Teleioi ) that is, perfect in agility and growth: and these are called by Pin∣darus (Monampycia,) afterwarde came in Synoris with two horsses, and in succession both Colts, Mares, and Mules: their courses are thus expressed by Virgill, Ergo animos aevumque notabis, Et quis cuique dolor victo, quae gloria palmae. Nonne vides? cum praecipiti certamine campum Corripuere, runt que effusum carcere currus: Cum spes arrectae inuenum: exultantiaque haurit Corda pauor pulsans, illi instant verbere torto, Et proni dant lora: volat viferuidus axis. Iamque humiles, iamque elati sublime videntur Aera per vacuum ferri atque assurgere in auras, Nec mora, nec requies: vt fuluae nimbus arenae Tollitur: humescunt spumis, flatuque sequentum: Tantus amor laudum tantae est victoria curae. Sin ad bella magis studium turmasque feroces: Aut Alphaea rotis prelabi flumina Pisae. Et Iouis in luco, currus agitare volantes Primus equi labor est animos atque arma videre Bellantum lituosque pati tractu{que} gementem Ferre rotam & stabulo frenos audire sonantes And Horace expresseth it in this maner: Sunt quos curriculo paluerem Olympicum Collegisse iuuat, metaque farindis Euitata rotis palmaque nobilis Terrarum dominos euehit ad deos. Women were wont to be excluded from these games, vntill Cynisca the daughter of Ar∣chidamus king of the Spartans, first of all other women nourished and trained horsses for these currule and Charyot games, and when she brought her horsses to Olympus, she ob∣taind the prize, therfore her horses wer consecrated to Iupiter Olympus, and their figures remained in brasse in his Temple. Pliny. It is also said that Echerates a Thessalian ouercame in the Olympian games with a Mare great with foale: And it is also reported that Miltiades the son of Cimon Stesagora (one of the tenne captaines of Athens ) ran away from Pisistratus the Tyrante, and in the time of his absence, he was twice victor at Olympus by foure Mares, the first time he bestowed the glory vpon his cozen German Miltiades, his mothers brothers sonne, and the second time he tooke it to himselfe, for which cause he was slaine by the sons of Pisistratus, his Mares were also buried ouer against him, with an inscription that they had won four games in O∣lympus, so that it appeared, hee ranne diuers times and neuer missed victory. At Athens they obserued these courses with horsses in honor of Theseus, and called the place of the running, Hippodromus. The Latines call it Stadium, and Curriculum, and it was appointed in some plain valley, according to the prouerbe; Equus in planiciem, in the middest whereof was a building called ( Circus ) whereon the beholders stood to looke vpon the pastime, and there were al∣so places to containe the horsses and Chariots, till they were turned out to run, (called Carceres ) according to the verses of Silius Sic vbi prosiluit piceo de carcere preceps Ante suos it victor Equus. And Horace also Vt cum carceribus missos rapit vngula currus Instat equis auriga suos vincetibus, illum Preteritum temnens exstremos inter Enutom. And heereof came the pouerbe ( A carceribus ad calcem ) signifieng, from the beginning of the race to the latter end. Eurithonius inuented a chariot called Harma, and was the firste that euer ran in Olympus with foure horsses in the same, of whom Virgill writeth thus: Primus Erichthonius currus & quataeior ausis Iungere Equos rapidisque insistere victor. And from hence came the tearme Quadriga for a chariot with foure horsses. There was a chariot in Athens drawne by one horsse, and the games thereof were called Polemysteri , Likewise at Rome in the Consuall-feasts celebrated for the honour of Neptune, they ran with horsses both ioynd and single. There were likewise games at Rome, called Aequitia, and Equiria, celebrated euery yeare, the twelfth of the calenders of May, wherein after the horsses they coursed Foxes tyed to peeces of wood set on fire, this is called in Latine also, Tarneamentum, and in Ita∣lian by Scoppa, Hagiostra, and in French Formierim. There is also a playe with horsses for children cald Troya, first inuented by Ascantus when he besieged Alba, & by him broght and taught to the Romaines, of which Virgill speaketh, saying: Incedunt pueri, pariterque ante ora parentum Frenatis lucent in equis, Cornea bina ferunt praefixa hastilia ferro: Pars laeues humero pharetras. Tres equitum numero turmae, ternique vagantur Ductores: pueri bisseni quenque secuti. Signum clamore paratis Aepytides longe dedit, insonuitque flagello, Olli discurrere pares, atque agmina terni Diductus soluere choris, rursusque vocati Conuertere vias, infestaque tela tulere. Inde alios ineunt cursus, aliosque recursus Aduersis spatijs, alternos{que} orbibus orbes Impediunt pugnaeque cient simulacha sub armis. Et nunc terga fugae nudant: nunc spicula vertunt Infensi; facta pariter nunc pace feruntur. Hunc morem cursus, atque haec certamina primus Ascanius, longam muris cum cingeret Albam Retulit, & priscos docuit celebare Latinos. Hinc maxima porro Accepit Roma, & patrium seruauit honorem: Troiaque nunc pueri, Troianum dicitur agmen. Of the greatest Horsse-maisters, and nourishers of Horsse. I T is reported of King Salomon, that he had forty thousand sta∣bles of horsses, for chariots, and twelue thousand for warre. The Lybians when they went to warre, did fight out of their chariots, and therefore they were said to fight vpon two hor∣ses. The Centaures were the first that euer taught men to fight on horsse-back, and the Roman Turnia consisted of two and thirty horsse-men, the Captaine whereof was called Beeurio. The people of Nomades called Surgatij, brought eight thou∣sand horssemen at one time into the field, which neither vsed armor, nor brasse, nor yron, except only their daggers, and a rope of leather thonges, wherewithall they entred the battaile, and ioyning with their enemie, they made certain ginnes, or loopes thereupon, which they cast vpon the necks of horsses and men, and so with multitudes drew them vnto them, in which draught they strangled them. The Indians vse the very selfe same Armour on horsse-backe that they do on foot, but yet they lead empty horsses and chariots to leape vp and down vpon, and to refresh their fighting horsses, and the number of their horsse-men were at one time, fourescore thou∣sand. When Pharnuches the Arabian, was riding on horsse-backe, there was a Dogge ran betwixt his horsses legges, wherewithall the horsse being amazed, suddainely leaped vp∣right, and cast off his Rider, who being brused with the fall, fell into a consumption: whereupon the Seruantes at the commaundement of their Maister, brought the saide horse into the place where he cast his Rider, and there cut off his legges aboue the knees. There was also a fashion for horsses to sight in battailes without bridles: For Fuluius Flac∣cus, when the Romaines ouerthrew the Celtiberians in Spaine, caused them to pull off their bridles from their horsses, that so they might runne with all voilence, without restraint of Riders vpon their enemies; whereupon followed victory: for many times it falleth out that the horsse hath more courage then his Rider, wherefore a good horse-man must haue skill to annoy his enemie, and defend himselfe; and likewise, to make his horsse to come off and on without feare or dread, according to necessity. There is a prouerbe in Greeke, ( Choris hippeis ) that is, ( Seorsim equites ) the horssemen are assunder, whereof Suidas giueth this reason: when Datys inuaded the territory of the Athenians ranging and destroying at his pleasure, no man daring to abide his forces, at his departure, the Ionians climed vp into trees, and signified vnto the Athenians, that the horssemen had broken ranke and were assunder. Whereupon Miltiades set vpon the sca∣tered company, and obtained a noble victory. Of fighting in warre vpon Horsses. T He most cruell and fearefull kind of fight, is the arming of horsses, which were called in auncient time Catafracti, and Clibanarij, and Acatafracti, and Ferentarij, fighting first of all with speare, and afterwardes with sword and shielde, ca∣sting sometimes also Dartes at one another, and bearing bowes to shoot arrowes, their horsses making roome for them, which way soeuer they went: for with sharpe pikes and other crooked-keene-cutting-instruments, fastened to their armour or Chariot-wheeles, in the violence of their course, they wounded, killed, ouer-turned, or cut assunder whatsoeuer flesh came in their reach. The auncient horsse-men of the Romaines had no brest-plates, (as Polibius affirmeth) and therefore they were naked in their fore parts, prouiding for the daunger that was be∣hind them, and defending their breasts by their owne celerity: their shieldes were made of Oxe skinnes plighted and pasted togither, being a little round in compasse like the fa∣shion of a mans belly. There was also great vse of swift horsses in Warre, for the Romaine souldiors caryed with them two horsses a peece, D n. being taught and exercised like Indians, when they had neede to flie, to leape vpon their empty horsse, for the sparing of their other: and they were therefore called Amppiphi, being apt to carry their maisters out of danger, and from hence ( Aelianus saith) the Romaines tooke the patterne of their Phalanx, (called Antisto∣mus▪ which they vsed to terrifie the Barbarians, setting their horses in a doubble front, so as they appeared headed both waies: and this was also the custome of al the▪ Germaines, when the number of their horsse-men was not equall, they mingled the foot-men, with their light horses, Alexander. who being experienced to runne suddainely with the horse-men, lea∣ped into the battaile, and surprized the enemies flying away: and the same fashion did the Spaniards also vse ( Strabo saith,) for the terrifieng of their enemies, making the foot men to fall into the battell among the horse-men. Those which did shoot Darts on horsebacke, were called Hippotoxotiae, and therefore Aristophanes in his discourse of byrds, calleth Hawkes by that name, for the resemblance betwixt them and horses, bearing these Riders. The hawkes are so called in the swiftnes of their course; & because the talants of the Hauke are crooked like bowes. Arianus writeth that the horse-men of Alexander carried speares in their handes, fourteene cubits long; whereunto I cannot consent, for eight cubits is a common size, as much as any Souldier on horse-backe is able to vse. In battaile there are wings of Horse-men, which are so called, because like Wings they couer and protect the Army. And there were also Legionary Horse-men, because they were ioyned to the Legions of Souldiers, and the company of Elephants, Foot-men, and Horsse-men which were wont to goe before the King, were called Agema. A company of Horsses set like a Tower in a Quadrangular forme in a fielde, was called ( Pergus. ) The Armour of Horsses on his front or fore-part, is called ( Prometopidia ) vpon the eares ( Paro∣tia ) vpon the cheekes ( Paria ) vpon the brest ( Prasternidia ) vpon the sides ( Parapleuridia ) vpon the loines ( Parameridia, ) vpon the Legges ( Paracnemidia.. ) And the time of arming a Horsse is knowne of euery Souldier. Of Riding. T He Meades, Persians, and Armenians, were the first that in∣uented the art of riding and shooting, (as Strabo saith,) Pausanias cald Neptune Hippeos for no other cause, but that it was supposed he was the first inuented the art of riding. Pollidorus ascribeth it to Bellerophon. Lysias the Orator sai∣eth that the Aamazonian Women were the first of all mor∣tall creatures that first aduentured to backe Horsses. O∣thers ascribe it to the Centaures: But to leaue the inuenti∣on, and come to the Art. Damis in the life of Apollonius, setteth downe the sum of the Art of riding, which briefely is this. To sit straight vpon his Horsse, to rule him valiantly, to turne him with the bridle which way soeuer he pleaseth, to beate him when hee is stubborne, to auoyde Ditches, Gulfes, and Whyrpooles when he rideth through Waters; going vp a hill, to lengthen the raines, and to restraine and draw them in going down the hill; now and then to stroke his haire, and not alwaies to vse stripes. Martial hath an excellent Epigrame vppon one Priscus a rash-headed-hunter, who nei∣ther feared Hedges, Hils, Dales, Ditches, Rockes, Riuers, nor other perils; vsing a bridle to his Horsse but none to his affections, and therefore he telleth him, that he may sooner break a Hunters necke, then take away a Hares life: for ther are deceits in the rocks, hils, and plaine fieldes, to shake the rider from horsebacke to the earth. Thus followeth the Epigram. Parcius vtaris moneo rapiente veredo Prisce, nec in leopores tam violentus eas. Saepe satisfecit praedae venator, & acri Decidit excussus nec rediturus equo. Insidias & campus habet: nec fussa, nec agger, Nec sint saxa licet, fallere plana solent. Non deerunt qui tanta tibi spectacula praestent: Inuidia fatised leuiore cadunt. Si te delectant animosa pericula, Thuscis (Tutior est virtus) insidiemur apris. Quid te frena iuuant temeraria? Saeptus illis Prisce datum est equitem rumpere, quam leporem. The best place for riding, is a barren and plaine Country. It is reported of Claudius, that when he had roade a great way in the Country vpon his enemies and met no body, he re∣turned backe againe into his owne Campe, and blamed the sluggishnesse of his enemies, because no one of them was seene abroad. It is reported by Aristotle, that the further a man rideth, the more apt hee shall be to weepe; and the reason is, because of all the motions of the body, riding is the wholsomest, both for the stomach, and for the hippes; for a man must not sit on horsebacke, as if hee were carried in a coach; but rather keepe his backe-bone vpright, not onely to be moued by his Horsse that beareth him, but also by himselfe; and therefore hee must sit close to the Horsses hips, extending his Legges to the vttermost, vsing not onely his eies to looke before him, but also lifting vp his neck to help his sight: for so the soft pace of the Horsse doth corroborate the spirit aboue al other exercises; likewise, the body and stomack; al∣so it purgeth the senses, and maketh them sharp; yet sometimes by the violent course of a Horsse, the breast of a man, or some other part about the raines receiue damage, (as some haue obserued:) yet is it not so much to be ascribed to the motion of riding, as to the vn∣easie pace, or rather to the vneasie seat of the rider. The Scythians aboue all other Nations haue the loosest and broadest bodies; and the reason is, because they wrap not their children in swadling cloathes as other people, and likewise because they haue no regard vnto their sitting vpon horseback, and lastly for their continual sloath and easie: for the men vse much to ride in Chariots, and Litters, before they get on horsebacke, but after they are accustomed thereunto they ride so much, that their hips and bones fal ful of ache, and they are also thereby made vnfit for generation, because in a iourney of an hundred Miles they neuer light to ease themselues and their beastes. These men hereafter named, were excellent riders & tamers of Horsses. Antomedon, ser∣uant of Achilles, Idaeus, seruant to Paraimus; Metiseus seruant to Turnus; Myrtilus seruant to Ocnomaus; Ceberes seruant to Darius; Anniceris, seruant to Cyreneus; Picus to Mesapus ; and Lausus Silius remembreth Cyrnus, Durius, Atlas, and Iberus. The instruments of Riding appertaining to a Horsse. A Good rider must consider the hardnesse or softnesse of his Horsses mouth, that so hee may temper his bit; for a stiffe necked horsse, is not so much to be guided by rod and Spur, as by bit, and bridle: wherefore it must sometime be hard, & sometimes gentle. The hard bits are called Lupati, because they are vnequal, and indented like to a wolues teeth, where∣vnto the Horsse being accustomed, groweth more tractable and obedient to a gentle bit. According to the saying of Ouid: Tempore pareot equus, lentis, animosis habenis Et placido duros, accipit ore lupos. And Virgill againe speaketh to like effect: prensisque negabunt Verbera lenta pati, & duris parere lupatis Asper equus, duris contunditur, ora lupatis. And Silius saith: Quadrupedem flectit, non cedens virga lupatis. There is also another instrument made of yron or Wood (called Pastomis ) and englished ( Barnacles ) which is to be put vpon the horsses Nose, to restraine his tenatious fury from biting, and kicking, especially at such time, as he is to be shod or dressed. The Indians wer wont to vse no bridles, like the Graecians and Celts, but only put vpon their horses mouth a piece of a raw Oxe skin, fastened round about, containing in it certaine yron pricks stan∣ding to the Horsses lips, putting a long a round trench through his mouth, to the edge whereof they fasten the raines, wherewithall they guide the beast. The Turkish Horsses, and Spanish Iennets haue bits, with open circles in the middle, consisting of leather, or I∣ron, to restraine the Horsses fury. The raines are (called Habenae ) because they make the horsses, Habeles, that is, tractable, and rulable, to be turned, restrained, or put forward, at our pleasure, according to the saying of Cilius ; Ferrato calce, atque effusa, largus habena, Cunctantem impellebat equum. And Virgill: Ipse ter aducta, circum caput egit habena. Neither is there any Horsse, swift, or slow, noble, or vnnoble, that can be guided without these, which must be held continually in the hand of the rider, they must not be vnequal, one longer then another, neither thicke, neither weake, nor brickle. There was a certaine Golden chaine (called Ampix ) wherewithall the fore-tops of Hor∣ses were wont to bee bound or tyed vp, and thereupon Homer calleth the Horsse of Mars, ( Crysampix ) and from hence came that custome of womens frontlets, to be adorned with gold and pretious stones. There are also other ornaments of Horses called trappings, and in Latine ( Phalerae ) deriued from Phalon in Greeke, signifying bright, because they were wont to put a great deale of Gold and Siluer on them, (as Liuius saith) which Horsses so trapped, were presents for great Princes: And there is a kind of Achates stone, wherwith∣all the Indians do adorne their Horsse trappings: and it was apparent in Homers time, that they vsed little Bels, or sounding pieces of Brasse to bee fastened to their horsses bridles and trappings; they hanged likewise Iewels, and pearles to the breast of their Horsses, which Virgill expresseth in this manner: Instratros ostro alipdes, pictisque tapetis Aurea pectoribus, demissa monilia pendent Tecti auro, fuluum mandunt, sub dentibus aurum. A good horse-man must also haue a paring knife, wherewithall to purge and open his Horsses feet; this is called by Rusius (Rossneta) and by others Scalprum. There is a kind of Manicle for the pasternes of Horsses, (called Numella. ) Moreouer a good rider must pro∣uide him stirrops, (called Subsellares and Staphae ) which although it bee but a new deuise, yet are they so necessary for euery Ryder, as without them they cannot long continue. They must not be made to straight for the foot, because that then they doe not onley hin∣der motion in that part, and so make it benummed and colde, but also giue occasion of great hurt to the Ryder in case the Horsse fall, except he can so temper himselfe to put but a very little part of his foote therein. There are also Spurs requisit to a Rider (called Calcaria ) because they are fastened to the heele of a man, wherewithall he pricketh his dull Horsse when he would haue him ha∣sten the iourney; and the Greekes deriue it from Muops, signifieng a pricking flye, from imitation of which creature it may seeme they tooke this inuention: but this must bee re∣membred, that they are prepared for the dull and sluggish Horsse, and not for the free and full of life; for such a Horsse being pricked therwith runneth forth rather with rage & disdaine then for loue of the iourney, and many times the torment thereof maketh him by kicking out of his heeles to cast off his rider. Lastly, he must haue regard to his Saddle, whereon hee must sit: for the Barbarians did vse to ride vpon bare Horsses backes, but since that time, the wiser sort of horse-men haue inuented a seate for their owne security. Martiall writeth heereof thus: Stragula succincti, venatur sume veredi, Nam solet a nudo, surgere ficus equo. Of hunting Horsses. H Vnting Horsses because of their swiftnesse, were wont to be called ( Veredi ) according to the saying: Sunt et veredi, cursu pernices ; Al∣though they vse this kind also for posts, and performance of spee∣dy iournies. The males are much better then the females, and ther∣fore they seldome vse Mares in hunting, because they are not so well able to leape, or endure the woodes, for which cause Gratius writeth in this manner of them; Restat equos finire notis, quos arma Dianae Admittant: non omne me as genus audet in artes Est vitium ex animo: sunt quos imbellia fallant: Corpora: praeueniens quondam est incommoda virtus. Oppianus in his discourse of hunting horsses, (as wee haue said already) aduiseth to make choise of them by the colour, vnto whom Gratius consenteth saying: Venanti melius pugnant color, optima nigri. They that are of blewish colour, hauing variable spotted Legs (he saith) are fittest to hunt Harts: they that are of a bright gray, to hunt Bears, and Leopards; they that are bay, or of a readish colour, to hunt the Boars; they that are blacke, hauing glazen eyes, are good against Lyons: and thus much for the hunting Horsses. Of coursers or swift light running Horsses. A Fter the vse of Wagons, and Chariots, which men had in∣uented for their ease in trauel, & growing to bee weary ther∣of, by reason of many discommodities, they came also to the vse of single Horsses, which therefore they called coursers, and now a daies a Horsse for Saddle, whereupon men per∣forme their iournies; and the Poets say the inuenter heerof, was Belerophon the Son of Neptune, to whom his father gaue Pegasus the flying Horsse, which therfore they describe with winges, and place for a star in heauen like an Angell, because of his incredible celerity: others attribute it to the inuention of Sesostris, otherwise called Sesonchosis, a K. of Egypt, some to Orus, when he waged war against his brother Typhon ; For these horsses, are no lesse profitable in war, then in peace, although none vse them in these daies, but common Souldiers, yet in auncient time the greatest nobles rode vpon them. The Emperor Probus had one of these Horsses, which was nothing comely nor very highe, yet would he endure ordinary iournies, to run a hun∣dred mile a day, whereupon his maister was wont to say merily, that hee was better for a flying, then a fighting Souldier. The Horsses of Spaine are of this kinde, which they call Iennets, of Genibus theyr knees, because when the rider is on their backs, he must hold his knees close to the Saddle and sides, for his better ease. Like vnto these are the Barbary Horsses, whom they geld, to keepe them from the hardnesse of the Nerues, which happe∣neth vnto them in their heate and trauell. There are a kinde of Horsses called Lycospacles, and the reason of this name is, as some say; because when they were Foales, they escaped the teeth of Wolues, being set on by them: and therefore they run the more speedily to their dying day, for the wounds of Wolues makes a Horsse light-footed; but this is not likely, for feare cannot put that into them which is not bred of nature, euen as we say, that Vlisses by auoyding Circes cup, or Cyclops, was therfore made wise, but rather on the con∣trary, because he was wise, therefore hee did auoide Circes cup; so likewise wee say, that these Horsses are not lighter of foot, nor fuller of courage, because they were set vpon by Wolues, and deliuered by feare, but because nature hath framed them, nimble, valiant, and couragious; therefore they did auoide the Wolfe. Aelianus also saith that these Horsses, had a wonderfull knowledge, and sagacity, to discerne betwixt Graecians and other nations; for when a Graecian came vnto them, they loued them, stood stil, and tooke meat at their hands, but if a Barbarian, or stranger came vnto them, they discerned them by their nose, as a dog doth the foot-steps of a beast, lif∣ting vp their voice, they ranne as fast away from them as they would from any rauening beast. These loued not onely their familiars, but aboue all other things, to be neate, fine, and cleauely in Chariots: For if at any time they came through water, drawing of a Cha∣riot they tooke a pride in clensing themselues from all durte and filthinesse cleauing to their legs or face. And that which is more strange, they were vnwilling in race, to be stai∣ed or taken out therof, as appeared by this story, related by Festus. There is saith he in Rom a great gate called Ratumena, which tooke his name from the death of a young man, an Hetrurian, whoe perished there in a race of chariots, being conqueror, because his horses would not stay vntill they came into the Capitoll, and saw the framed earthen Chariots which were placed in the porch of Iupiters Temple by the Romans, and were appointed to fashioned in earth by the hand of a cunning potter, the which being wrought in earth, and put into the furnace, they grew so great that they could not bee taken out whole; at the sight of these, the Horsses of Ratumena stood stil, but first of al, their maister was slain in the course by falling off. The horsses of Tartaria are so incredibly swift, that they will goe twentye Germaine miles in one day. There was a race of Horsses at Venice (called Lupiferae ) which were excee∣ding swift, and the common fame is, that they came vpon this occasion. There was a cer∣taine merry fellow which would become surety for euery man, for which hee was com∣monly Iested at in the whole Citty. It fortuned on a day, as he trauailed abroade in the Woodes, that he met with certaine hunters that had taken a Wolfe, they seeing him as∣ked him merrily if he would be surety for the Wolfe, and make good all his damages that he had done to their flocks, and Foales, who instantly confessed hee would vndertake for the Wolfe, if they would set him at liberty, the hunters tooke his word, and gaue the Wolfe his life, whereupon he departed without thankes to the hunters. Afterward in remembrance of this good turne, he brought to the house of his surety a great company of Mares without marke or brand, which he receiued, and branded them with the image of a Wolfe, and they weretherfore called ( Lupiferae ) from whom descen∣ded that gallant race of swift horsses among the Veneti : vppon these ride the postes, carry∣ing the letters of kings and Emperors to the appointed places, and these are said to refuse copulation with any other Horsses that are not of their owne kind and linage. The Persian horsses are also exceeding swift, which indeede haue giuen name vnto all others. The messengers of the great Cam King of Tartaria, haue their postes so appoin∣ted at euery fiue and twenty miles end, of these running light horsses, that they ride vpon them, two or three hundred miles a day; And the Pegasarian coursers of France, by the like change of horsses, run from Lyons to Rome in fiue or sixe daies. The Epethits of a swifte running corser are these, winged or wing-bearing, Larke-footed, breathing, speedy, light, stirred, couetous of race, flying, sweating, not slow, victorious, rash, violent, and Pegasaean. Virgill also describeth a swift and sluggish horsse most excellently in these verses; sending one of them to the Ring, and victory of running, without respect of Countrey or foode, they are to be praised for enriching his maister, and the other for his dulnesse to the mill, the verses are these following, —Nempe volucrem. Sic laudamus equum, facili cui plurima palma Feruet, & exultet vanco victoria circo. Nobilis hic, quocunque venit, degramine cuius Clara fuga ante alios, & primus in aequore puluis Sed venale pecus Corithae, posteritas & Hirpini, sirara, iugo victoria sedit, Nil tibi maiorum respectus, gratia nulla Vmbrarum, dominos pretijs mutare iubentur Exiguis, tritoque trahunt Epirhedia collo. Segnipedes, dignique malam versare Nepotis. One of these swift light horsses is not to be admitted to race or course vntil he be past three yeare old, and then may he be safely brought to the ring and put to the stretching of his legs in a composed or violent pace as Virgill saith: Carpere mox gyrum inicipiat gradibusque sonare. Compositis, sinuetque alterna volumina crurum. Pliny affirmeth that if the teeth of Wolues be tyed to these horsses it wil make them neuer to giue ouer in race, and when the Sarmatians were to take long iournies, the day before they gaue their horsses very little drinke and no meat at al, and so would they ride them an hundred and fifty miles out right. The Arabians also in many regions vse to ride vpon Mares, vpon whom they perform great iournies, and King Darius did also fight his battailes vpon Mares which had foales; Vartomanus. for if at any time their affaires went to wrack & they in danger, the Mares in remembrance of their foales at home would carry them away more speedily then any other horsse, and thus much for the light or swift horsses. Of the Gelding. T Hey haue vsed to lib their Horsses and take away their stones, and such an one is caled in Latine Canterius or Cantherius, which is de∣riued of Cauterium because they were seared with whot irons, or else from the stronger boughes or branches of Vines so called be∣cause they were pruned. In French Cheual Ogre, Cantier, Cheuron, and Soppa doth interpret the Spanish Ianetto to be a Gelding. It is said of Cato Censorius that he was carried and rode vpon a Gelding, and of these the Turkish Horsses receiue the greatest commendations. Grapaldus. Forasmuch as many Horsses by their seede and stones are made very fierce, truculent, and vnruly, by taking away of them, they are made seruiceable and quiet which before yealded vnto man very little profit: and this inuention may seeme first of all to be taken from them which fed diuers together in one heard, being taught the intollerable rage of their stoned Horsses towards their Colleagues and guides; for abating wherof they tooke from them their male-parts. Camerarius Of the manner heereof you may reade plentifully in Rusius, and hee affirmeth that the Scythians and Sarmatians, who keepe all their Horsses in heardes, were the first deuisers thereof: For these people vsing to robbe and forrage, were many times by the neighing of their vnruly Horsses discouered; for their property is to neigh not onely at Mares, but also at euery stranger that they see or winde, and for Males they were so head strong that they would diuers time cary away the ryder perforce and against his will to his owne de∣struction, in the rage of their naturall lust. Camerarius. If they be gelded vnder their dams when they sucke, it is reported by some, that from such their teeth neuer fal away, and beside in the heate of their course their nerues are not hardened, for which cause they are the best of all to run withall. They vse to geld them in March in the beginning of the spring, afterward being wel nourished they are no lesse strong, able and couragious then other vnlibbed, also there is a pretty prouerbe Cantherius in Fossa, a Gelding in a Ditch, which is then to be vsed, when a man vndertaketh a busines which he is not able to manage, for a Horsse can do much in a plaine, L i s but nothing at al in a Ditch. It is reported that Iubellius, Taurea, and C. Assellius, fought a combate on Horse-backe neare the Citty ( Capua, ) and when one had prouoked another a good while in the plaine fieldes, Taurea descended into a hollow way, telling his fellow combatant, that except he came downe vnto him, it would be a fight of Horsses and not of Horse-men, Whereunto Assellius yealded and came downe into the Ditch: at whom his aduersary iested, asking him if he did not know that a Gelding cold do nothing in a ditch, from whence came the common prouerbe aforesaid. There is also another prouerbe ( Anthenius in Porta. ) A Gelding in the gate, to signifie a a man who after he had vndertaken the performance of some great exploit, his hart faileth in the very enterance, for it is reported of one ( Sulpecias Galba ) who riding out of the Cit∣ty, Vestus his horse tyred in the gate. There is likewise another adage in Plautus which is this: Crete haec mulier cantherino ritu astans somniat. That is to say, this Woman sleepes standing like a new dressed Horsse, and is applied against them which in a kind of foolish iesture shut their eies when they talke or worke: and thus much for the Gelding. Of carriering Horsses for pompe or Triumphe. T He nature of these Horsses is to lift vp themselues and rise before, standing vpon their hinder Legges, which is not possible for any to doe without a generous and gallant spirit, and also nimble and strong loines to beare vp the hinder Legges, for it is not as many suppose that this power of rising before from the softnesse of his Legges, but rather from his loines and hips betwixt his hinder Legs, for when his mouth is a little checked with the bridle he pre∣sently bendeth his hinder pasterns and Ancles, and so lifteth vp his fore parts, that his bel∣ly and yard doe appeare, and in doing heerof the rider must not beare his hand hard, but giue him the bridle, that so he may doe it willingly and with greater grace of the behold∣ders. There are some which teach Horsses to lift vp themselues by knocking their pasternes with a rod, which the Horsse vnderstandeth as wel as he doth his race, when hee is stroke on the back by the rider. And in teaching of a Horse this feat, it must be obserued, that he neuer haue rest vntil he haue learned it, and that at certain signes and tokens, Xen ph . he be taught of his owne accord to performe diuers and sundry iestures: but if after long riding and copious labor, he begin to vnderstand his maisters pleasure, and rise twice or thrice toge∣ther, then you may giue him the raines, nothing doubting but that hee vnderstandeth and wil be obedient to the pleasure of the rider. And in this kind he is acounted the best caree∣ring Horse, which wil rise high & oftnest together; neither is there any quality so comen∣dable in a Horse as this, or that so draweth and (as it were) so imprisoneth the eies of old & young, and other beholders, for which cause Marshall Horsses for seruice of war, are to be instructed herein; And thus much for this Horse. Of load or Pack-horsses. W Here they keep Horsses in heards and flocks, they haue some which are not fit for the saddle, nor for the wars, and therefore are to be employed for the carring of burthens, or to the cart; althogh as Festus saith) mules were first vsed for carrying and draught; but for as much as all Nations haue not Mules, they are therfore inforced to vse Horsses, and for this purpose the Geldings are much better then the stoned Horsses; wher∣fore the countrymen of most nations take Horsses, for this purpose, after they be old, past breeding, or haue some other blemish in winde or lim, wherby they are disabled to trauell vnder a man: for so great is the greedines of our age, that horsses are not spared so long as they be able to liue; according to the common prouerbe ( Assinis equis Mulis feriae nullae ) Horsses, Mules, and Asses, keepe no hollidaies: where the law of God concerning the Sa∣both is not obserued; for the nourishing of horsses doth counteruaile the charges. A∣mong these may be remembred those little Nags called Hinni & Ginni spoken of already in the discorse of Asses, wherof som are generated betwixt a Horse and an Asse, and others fal to be very little, through some sicknesse which happeneth vnto them in their dams bel∣ly: these are vsed with shorne manes according to the saying of Propertius: huc mea deton∣sis aucta est cynthia manuis. They are vsed for pleasure, to carry the young sonnes of noble men and Gentle men. There are also horsses called ( Equifunales, because in their triumphs they were led with a halter next after the triumph. Of wilde Horsses, the Sea-horse, and the Hart-horse (called Hippellaphus. ) I N the daies of Gordianus there were brought to Rome forty wilde Horsses, and in the map of Gordianus wood, there were pictured three hundred. They are called in Latine Equiferi, and in Greek Hippagroi, they abound in Spain, & in the Alpes, and in the deserts of Aethiopia there are many of them, which haue two long venomous teeth standing out of their mouth: they differ also in their hoofes from other Horses, for they are clouen-footed like Harts, and they haue a long mane growing all a long their backe to their taile: Oppianus And if at any time the inha∣bitants take them by ginnes and other slights, they fall so sullen that they abstaine from meate and drinke disdaining to be kept in any seruitude or bondage, the Wilde Horsses of India haue but one horne: Albertus. In the Alpes they are of an ash-colour, with a blacke list downe their backes. The wilde horsses of Scythia, neare the Riuer Hypanis, are cleane white. The wilde horsses of Syria liue in flockes and heards togither, and in euery hearde they haue one Captaine or Maister ouer the residue, and if it Fortune that any of the younger horsses leape vpon a Mare, this captaine-horsse runneth after him, neuer giuing ouer till he hath bit off his stones. There are wilde horsses in Brushia which are like to other horsses in all parts, excepting their backes, Aristotle which are so soft and weake, that they cannot endure to be fat vppon, ney∣ther are they easily tamed, and the people of the country eat their flesh: In Polonia there is a kinde of wilde horsse which hath hornes like a Hart, and therefore I take it to bee the same which is called Hypellaphus, whose picture is heere described as it was taken heere in England, by that learned Physitian Docter Cay. The figure of HIPELLAPHVS. T His beast was brought out of Norway, hauing a mixt form, betwixt a Hart and a Horsse, hauing a wel compacted body, a long and leane leg, a clo∣uen hoofe, a short taile, and in all parts you would iudge him to be a Hart, but in his head and eares you would iudge him to be a mule, & in his horns a Roe, the vpper lip hanging ouer the neather almost as much as an Elkes: his mane like a horses, but thinner and standing more vpright, without other altera∣tion: from their shoulders to their taile, they haue a like bristling mane growing on the backe bone, as longe as their other haire, a bunch vnder their chappes, and vppon that a bunch or shagie haire, the hair about their shoulders is more longer than ordinary, but their neckes so short that they can neither drinke their drinke nor eat their meat vpon the ground, except they bend downe vpon their knees. The males in this kind doe onely beare hornes, and such as do not grow out of the Crownes of their head, but as it were out of the middle on either side, a litle aboue the eies, and so bend to the sides: They are sharp and full of bunches like Harts, no where smooth but in the tops of the speers, and where the vaines run to carry nutriment to their whole length, which is couered with a hairye skin: they are not so rough at the beginning or at the first prosses specially in the for part as they are in the second, for that onely is full of wrinckles; from the bottom to the middle they growe straight, but from thence they are a little recurued; they haue onely three speers or prosses, the two lower turne awry, but the vppermost groweth vpright to hea∣uen, yet sometimes it falleth out (as the keepers of the saide beast affirmed) that either by sicknes or else through want of food, the left horn hath but two branches: In length they are one Roman foot and a halfe, and one finger and a halfe in bredth, at the roote two Ro∣man palmes. The top of one of the hornes is distant from the top of the other three Ro∣man feet and three fingers, and the lower speere of one horne is distant from the lower of the other, two Roman feet measured from the roots: in substance and collor they are like to Harts hornes, they waied together with the dry broken spongy-bone of the forehead, fiue pound and a halfe, and halfe an ounce, (I meane sixteene ounces to the pound:) they fall off euery yeare in the month of Aprill like to Harts, and they are not hollow. The bredth of their fore-heads betwixt the hornes is two Roman palmes and a halfe, the top of the crown betwixt the horns is hollow on the hinder part, and in that siecel lieth the brain which discendeth downe to the middle region of the eies. Theyr teeth are like Harts, and inwardly in their cheekes they grow like furrowes, bigger then in a Horsse; the tooth rising out sharp aboue the throat, as it should seeme that none of his meate should fall thereinto vnbruised. This beast in his young age is of a mouse or Asse colour; but in his elder age it is more yellowish, especially in the extreame partes of his body: the haire smooth but most of all on his legges, but vnder his belly, in the inner part of his knee, the top of his Neck, breast, shoulders, and back-bone, not so smooth: In heigth it was about 22. handfuls and three fingers, being much swifter then any horse, the female beareth euery yeare as the keeper said in Norway two at a time, but in England it brought forth but one. The flesh of it is blacke, and the fibere broad like an Oxes; but being dressed like harts flesh and baked in an Ouen, it tasted much sweeter. It eateth commonly grasse, but in eng∣land seldome after the fashion of horsses, which forbeare hay when they may haue bread; but leaues, rindes of trees, bread and Oats, are most acceptable vnto it. It reacheth natu∣rally thirty hand breadths high, but if any thing be higher which it doth affect: it standeth vp vpon the hinder legs, and with the forelegs there imbraseth or leaneth to the tree, and with his mouth biteth off his desire. It drinketh water and also English Ale in great plenty, yet without drunkennesse; and there were that gaue it wine, but if it drinke plentifully it became drunk. It is a most plea∣sant creature being tamed, but being wilde is very fierce, and an enemy to mankind, per∣secuting men not only when he seeth them by the eie, but also by the sagacity of his nose following by foote more certainly then any horse, for which cause they which kept them neare the high waies, did euery yeare cut off their hornes with a saw: It setteth both vpon horse and foot-men; trampling and treading them vnder foot whom he did ouermatch, when he smelleth a man before hee seeth him, hee vttereth a voice like the gruntling of a Swine being without his female: it doth most naturally affect a woman, thrusting out his genital (which is like a Harts) as if it discernd sexes. In Norway, they cal it an Elke or Elend, but it is plaine they are deceiued in so calling it, because it hath not the legges of an Elke, which neuer bend, nor yet the hornes, as by conference may appeare. Muchlesse can I beleeue it to be the Hippardius, because the female wanteth hornes, and the head is like a Mules; but yet it may be that it is a kind of Elke, for the hornes are not alwaies alike, or ra∣ther the Elke is a kind of Horsse-hart, which Aristotle calleth Arrochosius of Arracotos a re∣gion of Assya, and heerein I leaue euery man to his iudgment; referring the reader vnto the former discourses of a Elke and the Tragelaphus. OF THE SEA-HORSE. T He Sea-horsse, called in Greeke Hippotomos, and in Latine Equus Fluuiatilis ; It is a most vgly and filthy beast, so cal∣led because in his voice and mane he resembleth a Horsse, but in his head an Oxe or a Calfe; in the residue of his bo∣dy a Swine, for which cause some Graecians call him som∣times a Sea-horsse, and sometimes a Sea-oxe, which thing hath moued many learned men in our time to affirme, that a Sea-horsse was neuer seene; whereunto I would easi∣ly subscribe (saith Bellonias ) were it not that the auncient figures of a Sea-horsse, altogether resembled that which is heere expressed; and was lately to bee seene at Constantinople, from whom this picture was taken. It liueth for the most part in Nilus, yet is it of a doubtful life, for it brings forth and breedeth on the land, and by the proportion of the Legges it seemeth rather to bee made for going, then for swimming: for in the night time it eateth both Hay and frutes, forraging into corne fieldes, and deuouring whatsoeuer commeth in the way; And there∣fore I thought it fit to be inserted into this story. As for the Sea-calfe, which commeth sometimes to land onely to take sleepe, I did not iudge it to belong to this discourse, be∣cause it feedeth onely in the waters. This picture was taken out the Colossus In the Vatican at Rome, representing the Ri∣uer Nylus, and eating of a Crocadile: and thus I reserue the farther discourse of this beast vnto the History of Fishes, adding only thus much, that it ought to be no wonder to con∣sider such monsters to come out of the Sea, which resemble horsses in their heads, seeing therein are also creatures like vnto Grapes and swords. The Orsean Indians do hunt a beast with one horne, hauing the body of a Horsse, and the head of a Hart. The Aethiopians likewise haue a beast, in the necke like vnto a Horsse, and the feet and legs like vnto an Oxe. The Rhinocephalus hath a necke like a Horsse, and also the other parts of his body, but it is said to breath out aire which killeth men. Pausani∣as writeth▪ that in the Temple of Gabales there is the picture of a Horsse, which from his breast backwards is like a whale. Lampsacenus writeth, that in the Scythian Ocean, ther are Ilands wherein the people are called Hippopodes, hauing the bodyes of men but the feete of Horsses, and the Lamya heereafter to be declared, hath the feete of a Horsse, but in o∣ther things the members of a Goat: and thus much for the seuerall kinds of Horsses, both for them that are properly so called, and also for any other which like bastards retaine any resemblance of nature with this Noble and profitable kind of beast. Of the diet of Horsses and their length of life. H Auing thus discoursed of the kinds of horsses, and their seueral accidents, and vses, both for War, and peace, pleasure, and necessity; now likewise it followeth, that we should proceed to their dyet, and manner of feeding: wherein wee are first of all to consider, that the naturall constitution of a Horsse, is whot and temperate. Whot, because of his Leuity, Russius and Veloci∣ty, and length of life; temperate because he is docible, pleasant, and gentle towardes his maister and keeper. He therefore that will keepe Horsses, must prouide for them aboun∣dance of meate, for all other cattell may be pinched without any great danger, only hor∣ses can endure no penury. ( Varro saith) that in feeding of Horsses, we must consider three things; first of all what foode the country wherein wee liue doth yeald; secondly when it must be giuen: thirdly, by whom, but specially the place of feeding Horsses is to be con∣sidered, for although Goates can liue in the Mountaines, better then in the greene fields, yet Horsses liue better in the greene fieldes, then they can in the Mountaines. For which cause when we chuse pasture for horsses, we must see that it be fat, such as groweth in med∣dowes, that in the winter time it may be sunny, & in the summer it may be open and cold, neither so soft vnder foot, but that the Horsses hoofes may feele some hardnesse, for hor∣ses, Mules, and Asses, do loue wel greene grasse, and fruits, yet principally they grow fat with drinking; When they are in the stables, let them haue dry hay. Palladius. A Mare when shee hath foaled giue herbarly, and generally at all times in the Winter season Bullimung, or a mixture of al kinds of graine is fit for them in the house, according to these verses of Ne∣metian : Inde vbi pubentes, calamos durauerit aestas Lactentesque vrens herbas siccauerit omnem Mensibus humorem, culmisque armarit, aristas Ordea tum, paleasque leues, praebere memento Puluere quin etiam, puras secernere fruges Cura sit, atque toros, manibus, percurrere equorum Gaudeat, vt plausu, sonipes, letumque, relaxet, Corpus, & altores, rapiat per viscera succos, Id curent famuli, comitumque animosa iuuentus. We haue shewed already, that they must haue straw, or litter to lie vpon, and Pollux doth set downe the kinds of meates for Horsses, as Barly, Hay, or French wheat, rise, and hay; for hard and dry meat is fittest for Horsses, because it doth not fill them with wind; but al green meat is the lesse aproued, by reason of inflamation. Three-leaud-grasse is also good for horsses, especially if they be young, for chaffe, hay, grasse, and Oats, are their natu∣ral and pleasing foode: and although grasse be moist, yet in the young age of a Horsse, he delights in moist meates, for they stretch out his belly, and encrease his growth, but when he is elder, then ought he to be nourished with dryer foode; as chaffe, barly, Oates, and such things. For although chaffe, by reason of their drynes make not a Horsse fat, yet doe they preserue him in perfect strength, for al hard things which are disolued with difficulty, do retaine their force of nutriment longer, but softer meats do not so; therefore the best diet or habitude for Horsses is to retaine the meane betwixt fatnesse and leannes. For fat∣nesse ministreth many humors to the nourishment of sicknesse, and leannesse diminisheth naturall strength, maketh the body deformed. In some countries they giue their horsses vine branches in the Autumne, to moue their bellies, and increase their strength. The hearb Medica which aboundeth in Media, is very nourishable to Horsses, but the first stalkes are refused, saith Aristotle, the residue being watered with stincking Water, Mathaeolus Dioscorides is most commodious. In Italy they fat their horsses with Trifoley, in Calabria with Sulla, or Arthritica, and the Thrasians, neare the Riuer Strymon, with a greene Thistle. In the spring time giue your younger Horsses Bullimung for many daies together, for that will not onely make them fat, but also purge their bellies: for this purgation is most necessary for Horsses, which is called soyling, and ought to continue ten daies together, without any other meat, giuing them the eleuenth day a little Barly, and so forward to the fourteeneth; after which day, continue them in that diet ten daies longer, and then bring them forth to exercise a little, and when as they sweat, annoint them with Oyle, and if the weather bee colde, keepe a fire in the stable: And you must remember when the Horsse beginneth to purge, that he be kept from Barley and drinke, and giue him greene meat, or Bullimumg, wherof that is best that groweth neare the Sea side. But if the Horsse goe to soile in Aprill, after fiue daies bring him forth, and wash him all ouer with Water, then wiping his haire from all wet and filth, and loose haires, poure vpon him Wine and Oyle, pressing it smooth vppon his backe, downe to his skinne, so let him be wiped all ouer againe and carried into the stable, to be dieted with Masline, or Bul∣limung as before, except he be troubled with the Glaunders, and then he must not feed on it in the daye time, least through the heate of the Sunne, he fall into the Mange or into madnesse. It is also requisite that while we feede our Horsses with green Corne, they be let blood in the vaines of the breast, and also cutte in the roofe of their mouths, that so those places being emptied which were stuffed with corruption, the vacuety may be replenished with better blood; a Horsse thus dieted shall not onely liue in more health and free from sick∣nesse, but also be more stronge to vndergoe his labour. With the blood that commeth out of him, mingled with Niter, Vineger, and Oyle, you shall annoint him all ouer, if so be he bee subiect to the Glaunders, or to the Mange, and then keepe him in the stable fiue daies together, suffering no curri-combe to come vpon him, vntill the sixt day, feeding him in the meane time with greene Corne, or Bulli∣mung ; and then bring him forth againe, washing him al ouer with water, and rubbing him with a hard whisp, vntill the humor or moistures be wholy wiped off, and he fed as before fourteene daies together. If you please not to keep him in the stable, then in the spring time, turne him out in some meddow, or greene pasture, and there let him feed at his owne pleasure; for it hath bin of∣ten proued, that such a dyet hath recouered many sicke Horsses. It is reported of the Horotae, and Gedrusij, and men of Freeseland, the Macedonians, and Lydians, doe feede their Horsses with fishes: Likewise the Paeonians which inhabit about Prasius neare the Mountaine Orbelus, doe feede their Horsses and all cattell which they yoake with fishes. Concerning the drinke of Horsses we haue spoken elswhere, and therefore we shal not need to say anything of it heere, except that the drinking much, and the horsse thrusting his head in deepe into the troubled water, is an vnfalible signe of his goodnesse; and the custome of some is, for to giue their horsses mashes made of water and corne sod toge∣ther or else, Beare, Ale or Wine, by drinking whereof, they encrease their spirits and stomach. Albertus saith, that some to make their Horsses fat, take Snailes, and beate them in pie∣ces, so putting them into their meates whereby they grow to a false fatnesse, which is ea∣sily disolued. By eating of blacke Hellibor, Oxen, Horsses and Swine, are killed: and thus much for the foode of Horsse. Concerning the voice of Horsses, the Latines call him Hinnitum, and the Graecians, Phruma, and Phrumatesta ; but this is certaine, that from their very foaling, the females haue a shrill and sharper voice then the males, which is fuller, and broader, vntill they be two yeare old, and after copulation their voice encreaseth, so continuing vntill they bee twenty yeare olde, after which time, it falleth, and decreaseth againe. The length of a Horsses life, (according to Aristotle ) is eighteen or twenty yeares, and if they bee well it ended and regarded in their youth: It hath been found, that some haue liued vnto fiue and twenty, The time of theyr life. or thirty year old. The femals liue longer then the males, because of their generation, for the immoderate lust of Horsses, shortneth their daies. And it hath beene found that a Mare hath liued to forty, or fifty yeares, and a Horsse to three and thirty: wherefore I do leaue the relation of Pliny and Atheneus, to be censured by the Reader, who affirme, that horsses in their time, liued threescore or seauenty yeares. Albertus also affirmeth, that a Souldiour told him for a certaine truth, that he knew a horsse which liued till he was three score yeares olde, and at that age, did seruice in the field. And August. Niphus also affirmeth, that the Riders of Ferdinand the first, told him, there was a horsse in their maisters stable of seuenty yeare old. The age of a horsse may be known by his teeth, and the Persian, Bohemian, Epirian, & Sycilian horsses, liue longer then the Spanish or Numidian. In their years, the female neuer groweth after fiue, nor the male after 6. in height or length, so as the male are soner perfited in the womb then the femals, on the contrary the females do sooner grow to their perfection after their foalling then the males. The males haue more teeth then the females, and in each sex they which haue fewest teeth, liue not so long, and in their old age, their teeth grow white. Now their age is dis∣cerned by their teeth on this manner, the first foure, that is two aboue, and two beneath, be changed, after they be thirty yeare olde, and a yeare after the foure next are changed in like manner, againe after another yeare, foure more are chaunged, so that after foure yeare, and six months, he looseth no teeth, except the canine, which commeth again in the fift and sixt yeare; so that afterwards their age cannot be diserned, because in the sea∣uenth yeare, they are al filled; An other vnfained note of their age, is the hollownesse of their temples, and their eye-lids beginning to wax gray, and their teeth hanging out of their mouths. They also haue litle blackes in the middle of their teeth. Some trye the age of their horsses, as a wise and learned man writeth, by considering twelue teeth, sixe aboue, and six beneath, for the old horsses haue longer and thinner teeth, which are black at the top, and there are certaine broaches or wrinckles in their teeth, which being filled, the marke is said to be out of their mouth. Some try the age of their horsses by their cheekes, for they pull vp the skin from the bones, and if it will quickly fal backe againe into his former place, they take it for an assu∣red token of the horsses youth: but if if it stande out and fal slowly downe, then on the contrary, they iudge the horsse to be old, and thus much for the age and dyet of horsses. Of the vses of Horsse-flesh, Mares milke, and other parts. T There were certaine people in Scythia, which were called Hippophagi, because they liued vpon horsse-flesh; such also were the Sarmatians and the Vandals : likewise in Scythia the lesse, neare Taurica Chersonnessus, the people do not onelie eat the flesh of horsses, but also their milk, and make cheese thereof. Athaeneus also affirmeth, that the manner of the an∣cient Persians was, vpon the feasts of their natiuities to rost an Oxe, an Asse, a Horsse, and a Cammell whole, and so set them before their guests. Inlike sort, they eat horse-flesh and Camels-flesh at Da∣mascus, and in Pollonia wilde horsses, especiallye that part, which groweth vnder the mane. The Sarmatians make meat of Millet seed, and mingle it with Mares milk, or with blood taken out of the vaines of their legs, wherewithall they make puddings, Mat michou Pau venetus and this is their chiefe food. So likewise doe the Tartarians, who hauing a horsse sicke, cut off his vl∣cer or wound, and so kil him and eat his flesh. The Gothes also in the daies of Virgill did drinke the blood of horsses, as appeareth by these verses: Profuit incensos, aestus auertere & inter Ima fertre pedis, salientem sanguine venam Bisaltae, quo more solent, acerque Gelonus Cumfugit in Rhodapem, atque indeserta Getarum Et lac concretum, cum sanguine potat equino. The poets do also faine, that Pelias, the Sonne of Tirus and Neptune, was educated by a Mare, and Metabus brought vp his Daughter Camillus with Mares milke, because she was borne wilde, hee also bredde her among the bushes, according to these verses: Hic natamindumis, interque horrentia lustra Armentalis equae & lacte ferino Nutribat, teneris immulgens vbera labris. The Tartarians drinke Mares milke, which they dresse like white wine, and call it Churnis, whereof Paulus Venetus rehearseth this story. The king of Tartar saith he, nourisheth a∣boue ten thousand milke white horsses and Mares, and euery yeare, vppon the eight and twenty day of August, they obserue a solemn feast, wherein the milk of these white mares is dressed and set forth in comely vessels. Afterward the king taketh a bowle full thereof, and poureth it on the ground rounde about him, being so taught by his Magitians, to offer sacrifice to the goddes of his coun∣try: For they perswade him, that the gods licke vp that milke spilt on the ground, and af∣terwards the king drinketh vp the residew, and besides him no body that day, except it be of the kings lignage, or of the country of Horiach (for the people of that country, haue liberty to tast thereof that day,) because of a battaile which once they obtained for the great Cam. The property of this milke is to loosen the belly; and because it is thin and hath no fat in it, therefore it easily discendeth, and doeth not curdle in the stomacke, and it is sayde that the Scythians can keep it twelue daies togither, therwithal satisfying their hunger, & quenching their thirst, and thus much shall satisfie for the naturall discourses of horsses; heereafter followeth the morrall. The morrall discourse of Horsses, concerning fictions, pictures, and other deuises. A Nd first of al for the morral dignity of horsses, ther is a cele∣stiall constellation called Hippos, according to these verses of Arratus thus translated: Huic Equus ille iubam quatiens fulgore micanti Summum contingit caput aluo stellaque tungens vna. The Latines call this starre Pegasus, and they say that hee is the sonne of Neptune and Gorgon; Medusa with striking his foot vpon a Rock in Hellicon a mountaine of Baeotia, opened a fountaine, which after his name was called Hippocrene. O∣thers tell the tale in this sort, at what time Bellerophon came to Praetus the sonne of Abas the king of the Argiues, Antia the kinges wife fell in loue with her ghuest, and making it knowne vnto him, promised him halfe hir husbands kingdome if he woulde lie with her, but he like an honest man abhorring so foule a fact, vtterly refu∣sed to accomplish the desire and dishonesty of the lustfull Queene; wherupon shee being affraid least he should disclose it vnto the king, preuented him by her owne complaint, enforming the king that he would haue rauished her: when the king heard this accusation (because he loued Bellerophon wel,) would not giue punishment himselfe, but sent him to Scheno eas the father of Queen Antia, that he in defence of his daughters chastity might take reuenge vpon him, who presently cast him to Chimaera, which at that time depopu∣lated all the coast of Lycia: but Bellerophon by the helpe of the horsse Pegasus did both o∣uercome and auoide the monster, and being weary of his life perceiuing that there was no good nor truth vpon the earth, determined to forsake the world and flye to heauen: who comming neare to Heauen, casting downe his eies to the earth, trembled to see how farre hee was distant from it, and so his heart fainting for feare, fell downe backe∣warde and perished, but his horsse kept on his flight to heauen, and was there placed among the stars by Iupiter. Euripides telleth the tale otherwise, for hee saith that Chiron the Centaure had a Daughter nourished in the mountaine Pelius which was called Theas and afterward Hippe, because of her exceeding hunting on horsse backe, shee was perswaded by Aeolus (the sonn of Hellen, a Nephew of Iupiters, to let him lie with her, wherupon she conceiued with child, and when the time of her deliuerance cam, she fled from her father into the woods, for feare the losse of her virginity should be knowne vn∣to him, but hee followed her to see what was the cause of his Daughters departure, whereupon shee desired of the Goddes that her father might not see her in trauaile, her prayer was graunted, and shee after her deliuery, was turned into a mare, and placed a∣mongst the stars. Others say that shee was a prophetesse, and because she reuealed the counsels of the Goddes, was therefore metamorphized in that shape in the place aforesaid. Others say, that because shee gaue ouer to worship Diana, she lost her first presence: but to returne to the first tale of Bellerophon, who after the death of Chimaera, growing proud for his va∣lor attempted to fly to heauen, but Iupiter trobled his horsse with a fury, and so he shook off his rider, who perished in the field, Alecus apo tese alese, because of his error: and Pe∣gasus was placed in heauen. But to come nearer to the description of the poetical horsse, Albertus Magnus and some others say, that it is a beast bred in Aethiopia, hauing the head and feete of a horsse, but horned, and wings much greater then the winges of an Eagle, which he not doth lift vp into the aire like a bird, but onely stretcheth them out when he runneth, whereby his only presence is terrible to all creatures, vnto whom he is enemy, but especially to men: but for the truth heereof (although Pliny and some others seeme to affirme as much) yet will I set downe nothing for trueth and certainety, because as the poets call euery swifte horsse volutres, and Alipedes, so the errour of that figure, hath rather giuen occasi∣on to the framing of this newe Monster Pegasus, then anye other reasonable Ali∣gory. Likewise I knowe no cause why the poets shoulde faine, that Ceres was turned into a Mare, and hidde hir selfe in the heards of Oncius, Neptune falling in loue with her, fol∣lowed her to those fields, and perceiuing that hee was deceiued, turned himselfe also into a horsse, and so had to doe with her, whereat Ceres was greeuously offended, and fell into a very great fury, for which cause shee was called Erinnis : yet afterwardes shee washed her selfe in the Riuer Ladon, laying aside al her rage and fury, at the fulnes of time she brought foorth Arion. And the Arcadians also had a certaine Denne, wherein they had a great remem∣brance of this rauishment of Ceres, sitting in a Denne, wherein they say she hidde hir selfe from all creatures, and whereunto they offer diuine worship. They picture her in a colts skinne, sitting like a woman in all parts, with a long garment downe to her ancles, but the head of a horsse with the pictures of many Dragons, and other such wilde beasts, hold∣ing in one of her hands a Dolphin, and in the other a Doue. By all which it is not easie for euery man to knowe and conceiue their meaning, that plenty of food signified by Ceres, doth not only maintaine men, Fowls, Beasts, and Fishes, but also the immoderate vse therof draweth men to inordinate lust and concupisence, and that the Goddes of the Heathen were more rather to be accounted beastes then men. Diana also among the Arcadians was called Eurippa, for the finding out of those Mares which Vlysses had lost: which Vlysses erected a statue for Neptune the greate Ryder, and they say that Hippolitus being torne in pieces by Horsses through the loue of Diana, and skill of Aesculapius, by the vertue of certaine Hearbes hee was restored vnto life againe: Whereupon Iupiter being sore vexed and angry with Aesculapius for such an inuention, deluding as it were the fury of the Goddes, killed him with light∣ning; and thrust him downe to hell, because no wretched man woulde feare death if such deuises might take place: which fact Virgil describeth in these verses: At Triuia Hippolitum secretis alma recondit Sedibus & nymphae Aegeriae nemorique relegat Solus vbi in siluis Italis ignobilius aeuum Exigerit, versoque vbi nomine virbius esset Vnde etiam Triuiae templo lucisque sacratis Cornipedes arcentur equi quod litore currum Et iuuenem Monstris pauidi effudere marinis. The Poets also do attribute vnto the night, blacke horsses, and vnto the day white. Homer saith, that the names of the day-horsses are Lampus & Phaethon, to the moon they ascribe two horsses, one blacke and another white, the reason of these inuentions, for the day and the night is, to signifie their speedy course or reuolution by the swiftnes of horsses, and of the darkenes of the night by the blacke horsses, and the light of the day by the white, and the Moone which for the most part is hidde and couered with earth, Textor. both encreasing and decreasing, they had the same reason to signifie her shadowed part by a black horse, and her bright part by a white one. The like fixtion they had of H c te, whom Ausonias calleth Tergemina, because shee is described with the heade of a Horsse, Heltodorus a Dogge, and a wilde Man, the horsse on the right hand, the Dogge on the left hand, and the wilde man in the middle: whereby they decla∣red, how vulgar, illiterate, and vnciuilized men, do participate in their conditions, the la∣bors and enuy of brute beasts. We may also read in the Annales of Tacitus, that in his time there was a Temple rai∣sed to Equestriall fortune, that is, for the honor of them which managed horsses to their owne profit, and the good of their countrey, and that Fuluius the Praetor in Spaine, be∣cause he obtained a victory against the Celtiberians, by the valiant diligence of his horsse∣men, was the first that builded that temple. Likewise, there was another temple in Baeotis for the same cause dedicated vnto Hercules. Coelius The auncient Pagans call the Godde of Horsses H ppona, as the Godde of Oxen B ∣bona. It is also apparant, that many Nations vse to Sacrifice horsses, for at S lentinuma horsse was cast aliue into the fyre and offered to Iupiter. Likewise the L cedemonians sacri∣fyced a horse to the winds: Gyraldus at Rome also they sacrificed a horse to Mars, & therof cam the terme of Equus October, which was sacrificed euery yeare in October in Campus Martius. This horsse was often taken out of a chariot, which was a Conqueror in race, & stood on the right hand, assone as he was killed som one caried his taile to a place called Regia, and for his head there was a continuall combate betwixt the inhabitants of the streetes ( Subur∣ra ) and ( S c auia ) which of them should possesse it: for the Suburans would haue fastened it to the wal of Regia, and the Sacrauiens to the Tower Mamillia. The reason why they sacrifyced a horse, some haue coniecturd because the Romans were the off spring of the Troyans, and they being deceiued by a horsse, their posterity made that Sacrifice for punishment of horsses: but it is more reasonable, that because they Sacrificed a conquering horsse, they did it onely for the honour of Mars (the god of victorie) or els because they would signifie, that flying awaie in battell was to be puni∣shed by the example of sacrificing of a swift horsse. The Carmani did also worship Mars, and because they had no horsses to vse in warre, they were forced to vse Asses, for which cause they Sacrificed an Asse vnto him. There is another fable amongst the Poets, that the Methimnaeans were commaunded by the Ora∣cle to cast a Virgin into the Se to Neptune, which they performd: now there was a yong man whose name was ( Ennallus ) which was in loue with the said Virgin, and seeing hir in he Waters, swum after her to saue her, but both of them were couered with the waters of the Sea, yet after a certaine space, Ennallus returned backe again, and brought newes that the virgin liued among the pharies of the Sea, and that he after that he had kept Nep∣tunes horses, by the helpe of a great waue, escaped awaie by swimming; for the poets fain that Neptunes chariot was drawn by horsses of the sea, acording to these verses of Gilius : Non aliter quotiens perlabitur aequora curru Extremamque petit Phaebaea cubilia Tethyn Fraenatis neptunus equis. They also faine that the Sunne is drawne with two swift white Horsses, Idolatry by the pictures of Horsses from whence came that abhomination, that the Kings of Iudaea had erected Horsses and Chariots in honor of the Sunne, which were set at the entrance of the Temple of the Lord; which Horsses were destroyed by Iosias, as we reade in holy Scripture. Munster. And the manner of their abhominati∣on was, that when they did worship to the Sunne, they roade vpon those Horsses from the entrance of the Temple to the chamber of Nethan-melech. The Persians also sacrificed a Horsse to Apollo according to these verses of Ouid : Placat equum Persis, radij hyperiona cinctus Ne detur sceleri victima tarda deo. And for this cause the Masagetes sacrificed a horsse (the swiftest of all Beasts) vnto the sun, the swiftest of all the Gods. Philostratus also recordeth, that Palamedes gaue charge to the Graecians to sacrifice to the Sunne rising a white horsse. The Rhodians in honor of the Sun did cast yearly away into the Sea, the Chariots dedicated to the Sunne, in imagination that the Sunne was carried about the World in a Chariot, drawen by sixe Horsses. As the Army of the Persians did proceede forward on their iournie, The ceremo¦ny of the Per∣sians going to war the fire which they did (call holy and eternall) was lifted vp on Siluer alters: Presently after this, there followed the Wise-men, and after those wise-men came 165. young men, being cloathed with as many red little-garments as there are daies in the year: Instantly vpon the same, came the holy Chariots of Iupiter, which was drawne by white Horsses: after which, with a resplendant magnitude the Horsse of the Sun was seene to appeare (for so it was called) and this was the manner of their sacrifice. Coelius The King of Indians also (as is said) when the daies began to waxe long, he descended downe to the Riuer Indus, and thereunto sacrificed black Horsses and Buls, for the Buls in ancient time were consecrated to the riuers, and horsses also were throwne therinto aliue, Varrmus as the Troians did into Xanthus. The Veneti (which worshiped Diomedes with singuler honor) did sacrifice to him a whit horsse: when the Thebanes made war on the Lacedaemonians, Strabo it is said that Caedasus apeared in a vision to Pelapidas, one of the Thebane Captaines, and told him that now the Lacedae∣monians were a Laeuctra, and would take vengance vpon the Thebanes, and their Daughters; Whereupon Pelapidas to auert that mischiefe, caused a young foale to be gallantly attired, and the day before they ioyned battel, to be led to a Sepulcher of their virgins, and ther to be killed and sacrificed. The Thessalians obserued this custome at their marriges and nuptial sacrifices, the man tooke a Horsse of War armed and furnished, which he led into the Temple, after the sa∣crifice ended he deliuered the raines of the bridle into the hands of his Wife who led the same Horsse home againe, but for what signification or cause this rite was obserued, Plutarch. Aeli∣anus which relateth the story sheweth not, but saieth he referreth himselfe to the Thessali∣ans to declare their owne reasons of this obseruation, and thus much shall suffice concer∣ning the sacrificing of Horsses. Another moral-honor done vnto them was their burial; The burial of Horses For we haue shewed already that Volucer the Horsse of Verus the Emperour was honourably buried, the Mares of Ci∣non which had won three games at Olympus, were likewise interred neare his owne body. The Scithians at the burial of their kings vsed for to strangle one of his harlots, his cupbe∣rer, his Cooke, his Horsse-keeper, his messenger, and also Horsses and other cattell; and after a yeare they do this the second time; taking fifty of his dearest seruantes which were natural Scythians and strangled them; Likewise fifty of his best Horsses, out of whose bel∣lies they pul out their bowels and guttes, and filling their bellies vppe againe with chaffe, they sowe them vp: then make they halfe an arch vpon two posts standing vpright, and likewise the other halfe vpon two other postes ouer the kings graue; Likewise fastening in the earth diuers other sharp posts vpon which they put the fifty horsses, so fastening them with thicke pieces of timber al along their neck and back, so that the shoulders of the hor∣ses rest vpon the fore-arch and their bellies on the hinder, their legs standing vpward, then bridle they the horsses, and stretch foorth the reynes of their bridles vnto the poastes of the earth, afterwards vpon euery one of the dead horsses they lay a dead man, putting a stake through his backe out of his necke, and the ne ther part of the said stake they fast∣en in the poste, which pierceth or goeth thorough the horsse, and thus hauing compas∣sed about the graue of their king, with such horsses and horsse-men, they depart, leauing both one and the other to the consumption of nature, and after this manner did they bu∣ry all their kings. Adrian buried his hunting horsse, Enomaus his Mares, Partheria and Eripha. Like∣wise Miltiades, . Euagoras, and Augustus the Emperor: At Agrigentum also there are many Piramides erected vpon the sepulchres of horsses, and thus much shal suffice for the buri∣all of horsses. Aelianus. iny. We haue shewed you already how men and women haue bin transformed into hor∣ses, according to the fiction of the Poets, as of Saturne, Iupiter, Neptune, Ceres, Hippes, and Ocyrrhoes the daughtrrs of Chiron. lus Predictions by horses In like sort there haue beene predictions or osten∣tations of things to come, taken from a Wolfe, a Fox, and a Serpent, and a Horsse, which were called Auspicia Pedestria. Dreames also haue beene declared by horsses, for Publius Vatinius in the Macedonian warre, comming towards Rome in the night time, supposed he saw two yong men of ex∣cellent beauty to meet him, and tell him that Perses the king was taken by Paulus, which thing he declared to the Senate, but was by them put into prison as a contemner of the Maiesty and honor of that Captaine, but afterwards it appeard by the letters of Paul that Perses was taken that very day; whereupon Vatinius was deliuered out of prison, and re∣warded with land and liberty. ler. Max. It also apeareth that the same day that Castor and Pollux washed away the sweat of them selues and their horsses, in the lake of Iuturne, that they watched for the safety of the Ro∣man Empire, and their Temple which was ioyned to the same fountain being fast locked, vpon a suddaine flew open without the hand of man. Aenaeas also in Virgill saith, that he knew war woulde follow by the appearance of foure horsses, which in a green field set vpon a whole campe, whereuppon in Virgill he speaketh thus to Anchises. Quatuor hic, primum omen Equos in gramine vidi Trudentes campum late candore nouali Et pater Anchises bellum o terra hospita partes Bello armantur equi, bellum haec armenta minantur Sed tamen ijdem olim curru succedere sueti Quadrupedes & fraena iugo concordia ferre Spes est pacis ait. Lucan also speaketh to the same purpose that horsses presage warre; Primus ab aequorea percussis cuspide saxis Thessalicus sonipes bellis feralibus omen Exiluit. Alexander also writeth, that the Germans were wont to bring vp white horsses which wer neuer vsed to labour, by whose neighing they were forewarned of warres, and of other strange euentes. It is vulgarly knowne how Darius came to the kingdome of Persia, after it was agreed amongst the seuen princes, that he whose horsse did first neigh in the mor∣ning in a place appointed, should be saluted king, Ebares his rider in the night time tooke one of the Mares which he knew his maisters horsse loued, and ledd her into the suburbs, and there tied her, afterward he brought thither Darius his horse, and led him about hir 2. or three times, and at length suffered him to couer her, and so ledde them both away to∣gither. In the next morning the princes met as soone as day brake, and road vp and down the subburbs, vntil at last they came to the place where the Mare of Darius was tied the night before, whereunto the horsse of Darius ran neighing strongly, and presently it thundered and lightned in a cleere day: whereuppon the residue of the princes alighted from their horses, and did reuerence to king Darius, whom by diuine appointment was thus aduan∣ced to the Scepter. Although there be some that say Ebores by handling of a Mares genitall and keeping his hand warme, vntill they came to the place aforesaide, there stroking the Nostrils of his maisters horsse, caused him thus to neigh and win the kingdome, yet I rather incline to the former opinion which was related by Herodotus in his Thalia. There haue also beene horsses of strange fashions, for as we haue shewed already, that a Mare did bring forth a Hare, so also ( Liuy sayth) an Oxe did bring foorth a Foale. Of Monster horse. Nero did shew certaine Hermaphrodite mares, wherewithall his chariot was drawne, which was a thing worth the sight, that the Monarcke of the worlde should sit vpon Monsters. Iulius Caesar had a horsse which had clouen hooues like a mans fingers, and because he was foaled at that time when the south-sayers had pronounced that hee should haue the gouernment of the world, therefore he nourished him carefully, Pli ius and neuer permitted any man to backe him but himselfe, which afterwards he dedicated in the Temple of Ve∣nus, for he conceiued, that such a strange beast bredde in his owne flocke was a prediction vnto him of great honor. The Palatine of Vilua had a horsse soled with fiue legs, Dion. Coelius and Hen∣ry the count- Palatine had likewise a horsse with sixe legs: Thus much may suffice for the monster horsses. In the next place it is good to enquire what the Centaures are, who are described by the Poets to haue their forepar like men, and their hinder part like horsses, Of Centaurs the occasion wherof is thus related by Pindarus : that Centauru the Sonne of Ixion, committed bugge∣ry wich the mares of Magnetia, vnder the mountaine Pelius, from whence came that mon∣strous birth in the vpper part resembling the father and in the neather the mother. These faith he possessed the mountaines and desart places of Thessaly, being giuen to all man∣ner of Latrociny and Depraedation. They were called also Hippocentauri : And some saye that they were first of all nourished by the Nimphes in the mountaine Pelius, who after∣wards being the first that tamed horsses, were thought to be halfe men, and halfe horses, because they were seene backward, and from hence came the fable that they were tamed by Hercules, which was one of his greatest labours: But yet that no man may wonder or thinke it impossible that such monstrous creatures should haue existence in nature, these authorities following may perswade sufficiently. Plutarch in his banker of wisemen, affirmeth, there was a horsse-keeper which broght into the house of Periander an infant or rather a monster which he had got vpon a Mare, which had the head, necke, hands and voice o a child, and the other partes like a horsse, Diocles presently iudged it to bee a monster, and signified contentions and strifes in the world. But Thales told Periander he was of another opinion, namely, that it was no mon∣ster, but a meere naturall birth from such a copulation, and therefore aduised Periander, that either he should keepe no riders, or els let them haue wiues. Claudius Caesar also writeth, that in the time of his raigne there was such a one borne in Thessaly, which dyed the same day it was borne: and Pliny that he afterwards saw it sea¦soned in hony, brought out of Egypt to be shewed to the Emperor. These Centaures Ho∣mer calleth Feray, that is Ferae, wilde persons. The Lapithae and the Centaures are said to be very like the one to the other and were also once very louing, but they fell afterwards to deadly war, by reason the Centaures in a banket being drunk, offered to rauish the famals of the Lapithae, for which cause the Lopithae slew them in their iealosie, wheron fell a mortal war, whereby the poets signifie how intemperancy in men & beasts doth not only bring with it other sins, but also causeth much slaughter. And so I conclude the story of Cen∣taures, holding it possible that such should be generated by vncleane and vnnaturall co∣pulation, but vnpossible that they should liue long after birth, and therefore the Centaurs of the Poets are nothing els but men sitting on horssebacke, mistaken for one entire crea∣ture which were diuided, and so I conclude with the verse of Horace: Humano capiti cernicem pictor Equinan Hoc monstrum puto Centaurus foret. Of the statues and figures of Horsses. I T is was no smal dignity that the ancient Cephalenes did stamp their mony with the picture of a horsse, for surely from them it came, . that coine was firste of all called currant, because of the ymage of a speedy horsse, wherewithall it wes imprinted. Textor also writeth, that amongest the auncientes there was a custome to make the Character of a horsse in the forehead of a boud-slaue, there was also ymages of horssemen and horsses renowned in many countries for the honor of both, such were the statues of the Amazons (cald Hippiades (who by Lysias the Oratour are saide to be the first that euer backed horsses: Such was the statue of Claelia, Quintus Martius; Tremulus, Domitianus, and manye other both men and women: for the Romaines had the Equestriall statues in great reuerence and ceremony, no doubt in imitation of the Graecians, but with this difference, that they pictured none but the swift horsses, but the Romans, horsses and chariots, and from hence came the custome to haue chariots in triumph. But this custome to haue six horsses in a chariot was brought in last of all by Augustus. Aristolemus pictured the chariots and wagener. Pisicrates the woman Pitho, with a wagon. Eut crates the sonne of Lysippus expressed the Equestriall combate at the Oracle of Tro∣ph nium with singular art, also many Chariots of Medea, the horsse and his cariage: there were also chariots at Rome in the porch of Iupiters Temple, as we haue shewed before in the discourse of chariots. When Constantinus the great took a view of the citie of Rome, and passing from place to place, came at length to Forum Traiani, the most exquisite building of all the world, he st od amazed at the admirable frame of Giants, which were lineally deciphered therein, whereof disparing to imitate any part of that worke, he chose onely to erect the picture of such a horsse & prince, Amianus as in the middle of the same was erected, in remembrance of Tra∣iane▪ and so much he intimated to his followers: close by him stood that princely Hormis∣da a (a persian) who made the Emperor this answere: Ante imperator stabulum tale condi iu∣ eto si vales: Equus quem fabrica e disponis ita late succedat vt iste quem videmus: O Noble Empe. before you make such a horsse, first of all builde such a stable; that your worke in all parts may be correspondent to this which you propose vnto your selfe to imitate. M llus the Macedonian raised two porches which were compassed about with two horsses, without inscription or dedication, which now are compassed with the porches of Octauia, & the row of Equestrial statues in the front of the said buildings, now the grea∣test ornament of that place, he also brought out of Macedonia. And it is said that Alexan∣der the great caused Lysippus (that singular workeman) to frame the pictures of all those knights which in his company were slaine at the Riuer Granicum, and also to place his owne picture amongst them. In the citty of Rome there are two mountaines called Equilini, in one of them are the ba hes of Dic lesian, and the great Marble horsses, with two men halfe naked, holdinge their reines, being most singular workemanship, whereof one hath this inscription in la∣tine letters Opus Praxitelis, the vvork of Praxitiles, the other Opus Phidiae the vvork of Phi∣dias : and it is cleare, that they were brought thither by Tyridates king of Armenia, for whose entertainment Nero caused the Theatre of Pompey to be couered all ouer with gold in the space of one daie. C pontinus The story of the Troian horsse is vulgarlie known, which is also ca∣led Equus Durateus, or Durens, wherein Graecian princes hid themselues, when they tooke Troy, according to these verses: Nec cum duratens Troianis pergama partu Inflammascit Equus nocturno graiugenarum. The truth whereof standeth thus, the Graecians making shew that they had vowed a vow vnto Pallas, framed a horsse of so great bignes, that it coulde not be taken into Troy, ex∣cept the gates were pulled downe; and this they placed hard to the wals of Troy: Sinon (the counterfet runagat) being then within the wals among the Troyans, perswaded them to pull downe their wals and pul in that wooden horsse; affirming that if they could get it, Pallas would stand so friendly to them that the Graecians should neuer be able to mooue warre against them: wherefore they pull downe their gates, and part of their wall, and by that meanes do bring the horsse into the citty: while the Troyans were thus reuelling and making merry with themselues, and not thinking of any harme might ensue vpon them, the leaders of the Graecian army who by deceit all this while kept themselues close hid, (euer since which time the Graecians are tearmed of all nations deceitfull) on a suddaine rose out of their lurking places, and so going forward inuaded the citty, being destitute of any defence, and by this meanes subdewed it. Others are of opinion, that the poets fiction of the Troyan horsse, was no other but this, that there was a mountaine neare Troy called Equus, and by aduantage thereof Troy was taken, whereunto Virgill seemeth to alude, saying; Instar montis Equum diuina Palladis arte Aedificant. For they saie that Pallas and Epeus made the horsse, and therefore I coniecture, that the Troian horsse was nothing else but an engine of war, like vnto that which is called Aries: For ( Pausanias saith) that Epeus was the inuenter, thereof. And Higintas saith, that the Troyan horsse was Machina oppugnatoira, a deuise of war, to ouerthrow the wals. Of this horsse there was a brazen image at Athens in Acropolis, with this inscription, Chaeridemus, Fuangeli filius caelenenatus dicauit. When Alexander looked vpon his own picture at Ephesus which Apelles had drawne with all his skill, the king did not commend it according to the worth thereof: It fortuned that a horsse was brought into the roome, who presentlie neighed at the picture of Alexanders horsse, smelling vnto it as to a liuing horsse, where at Apelles spake thus to the king: Ho men Hippos eoice sou graphicoteros Cata polu. That is to say: the horsse is a better discerner of truth then you. There was one Phormis which went from Maenalus in Arcadia into Scicilia, to serue Gelon the Sonne of Dinomenes, vnder whom and his brother Hiero he arose to great estate of wealth, and therefore he gaue many guifts to Apollo at Delphos, and made two brazen horsses with their riders at Olympia, setting Dionisius the Graecian vpon one, and Simon E∣genenta vpon the other. Aemilius Censorinus (a cruel Tirant in Scicilia ) bestowed great gifts vpon such as could in∣uent new kind of Torments; there was one Aruntius Paterculus, hoping to receiue from him some great reward made a brazen horsse, and presented it to the Tirant: to include therein such as he should condemne to death: at the receipt whereof Aemilius which was neuer iust before, first of all put the author into it, that he might take experience how cur∣sed a thing it was to minister vnto crueltie. Apelles also painted Clytus on horsse-backe hastening to war, and his armour bearer reaching his helmet vnto him, so liuely, that other dumb beasts were affraid of his horsse. And excellent was the skil of Nealces who had so pictured a horsse foaming that the be∣holders were wont to take their handkerchefs to wipe it from his mouth: and thus much for the morrall vses of horsses. Of the seuerall diseases of Horsses and their cures. S Eeing in this discourse I haue principally aymed at the pleasure, delight, and profitte of Englishmen, I haue thought good to discource of the diseases of horsses and their cures in the words of our owne countrymen M. Blundevile, and M. Markham, whose works of these matters are to be recorded like the Il∣liads of Homer in many places and seuerall Monumentes, to the the entent that enuy or Barbarisme may neuer be able to burie them in obliuion, or neglect to root them out of the world, without the losse of other memorable labors. Wherefore good Reader, for the ensuing Tractate of diseases and cure; compiled by them, after that I had read ouer the labors of C. Gesner, and compared it with them, find∣ing nothing of substance in him, which is not more materially, perspicuously, profitably, and familiarly, either extracted or expressed by them, in a method most fitting this Hy∣story, I haue thoght good to follow thē in the description of the disease and the remedy, first (according to time) declaring them in the words of M. Blund. and afterwards in the words of M. Markam methodically one after the other in the same place: wherwithal I trust the liuing authors will not be displeased, that so you may with one labour examin both; and I hope, that neither they nor any of their friends or Schollers shall receiue any iuste cause of offence, by adding this part of their studies to our labors, neither their bookes imprinted, be any way disgraced or hindered, but rather reuiued, renobled, and honou∣red. To beginne therefore (saith Maister Blundeuill ) after the discourse of the nature of a horsse followeth those things which are against nature, the knowledge whereof is as need fully profitable as the other. Things against nature be those whereby the heathfull estate of a horsse-body is decayed, which are in number three. That is, the causes, the sicknes, and the accidentes; of the two first in order, and the other promiscuously as neede re∣quireth. Of causes and kinds thereof. T He causes of sickenes be vnnaturall affects, or euill disposi∣tions preceding sicknesse, and prouoking the same, which of themselues do not hinder the actions of the bodye, but by meanes of sicknesse comming betwixt. Blundevile Of causes, some be called internal, and some Externall. Internall be those that breede within the body of the beast, as euill iuice. Ex∣ternall be those that chance outwardly to the body, as heat, cold, or the stinging of a Serpent, and such like. In knowing the cause of euery disease, consisteth the chiefe skill of the Ferrer. For vnlesse he knoweth the cause of the disease, it is impossible for him to cure it wel and skilfully. And therefore I wish al Ferrers to be dili∣gent in seeking to know the causes of all diseases, as wel in the parts similer, as instrumen∣tall▪ and to know whether such causes be simple, or compound: for as they be simple or compound, so do they engender simple or compound diseases. Of sicknesse what it is, and how many generall kinds there be, also with what order the diseases of Horsses are heerein declared. And finally, of the foure times, belonging to euery sicknesse. S Icknes is an euill affect contrary to nature, hindring of it selfe, some action of the body. Of sickenes there be three generall kindes, whereof the firste consisteth in the parts simyler; the second in the parts instrumental: and the third in both parts togither. The first kind, is called of the Latines In∣temper es, that is to say, euill temperature, which is either simple or com∣pound. It is simple, when one quality onlie doth abound or exceed too much, as to be too hot or too cold; it is compound, as when manie qualities do exceed, as when the body is too hot and too drie, or too cold and too moist. The second kind is called Mala constitutio, that is to say, an euil state or composition, which is to be considered, eyther by the shape, number, quantity, or sight of the member, or part euell affected or diseased. The thirde kind is called Vnitatis solutio, that is to saie, the loosening or diuision of the vnitie, which as it may chaunce diuerslie; so it hath diuers names accordinglie: for if such solution or diuision be in a bone, then it is called a fracture, if it be in anie fleshie part, then it is called a wounde or vlcer; in the vaines a rupture, in the sinnews a conuulsion or crampe, and in the skin an excoriation. Againe, of diseases, some be called long, and some sharpe and short, called of the La∣tines, Morbi accuti, which be perillous, and do quickly kill the body. The long, do tarrye longer by it. Yet moreouer there is sicknes by it selfe, and sicknes by consent. Sicknesse by it selfe, is that which being in some member, hindereth the action thereof by it selfe. Sicknesse by consent, is deriued out of one member into another, through the neighbor∣hood and community that is betwixt them: as the pain of the head which commeth from the stomacke. Thus the learned Physitians which write of mans body, do diuide sicknesse. But Absir∣tus writing of horsse-leach craft, saith of that sicknes or rather malady (for so he termeth it, vsing that worde as a generall name to all manner of diseases that be in a horsse) there be foure kinds: that is to say, the moist malady, the dry malady, the malady of the ioynts, and the malady betwixt the flesh and the skin. The moist malady is that which we call the Glanders: the dry maladie is an incurable consumption, which some perhaps would call the mourning of the cheine, but not rightly, as shall well appeare vnto you heereafter: The malady of the ioynts comprehendeth al griefes and sorances that be in the ioyntes: And the malady betwixt the flesh and the skin, is that which we call the scab: vnto which foure kindes of maladies Vegetius addeth three others, that is, the Farcine, the paine of the Reynes or Kidneys, and the cankered Mangenesse, most commonly called of the old writers the Leprosie; and so maketh seauen kinds of maladies, vnder which all other par∣ticular diseases are comprehended. Againe, Laurentius Russius, vseth an other kind of diuision of sicknes. Of horsses disea∣ses (saith he) some be naturall, and some accidentall. The natural be those that do come either through the excesse, or lacke of engendring seed, or by error of nature, in missor∣ming the young, or else by some defect of the damme or sire, in that perhaps they be di∣seased within, and haue their seed corrupted. The accidentall diseases be those that come by chaunce, as by surfetting of cold, heat, and such like thing. But forasmuch as none of these writers doe follow their owne diuisi∣ons, nor handle the partes thereof accordingly: to auoide their confusion, and to teach plainely: I thought good and profitable therefore to vse this my owne diuision and order heere following. First then, of diseases some be inward, and some be outward. The inward be those that breede within the horsses bodie, and are properly called maladies and diseases, whereof some do ocupy al the wholebodie, and some particular parts or members of the body. Of those then that occupie all the body, and not be accident to any priuate mem∣ber, I do first treat, as of Agues, of the Pestilence, and such like, and then of those that be incident to euery particluar member, beginning at the head, and so proceede orderly throughout all the members, euen downe to the sole of the foot, obseruing therein so nie as I can, the selfe same order that Galen vseth in his booke, De locis male affectis, decla∣ring first, what manner of disease it is, and how it is called in English, and also in Italian, because the Kings stable is neuer without Italian riders, of whome our Ferrers haue bor∣rowed many names, as you shal perceiue heerafter. Then the causes whereof it proceeds, and the signes how to know it, and finally, the cure and diet belonging to the same, and because I find not inward diseases enow to answeare euery part of the body, I doe not let to enterlace them with outward diseases, incident to those partes, yea rather, I leaue out no outwarde disease belonging to anie particular member, and to the en∣tent you maie the better know to what diseases or sorances euerie part or member of the horsses bodie is most commonly subiect. And note by the way, that I call those outward diseases that proceede not of any inwarde cause, but of some outwarde cause, as when a horsse is shouldered by meanes of some outward cause, or his backe galled with the sad∣dle, or his sides spurgalled, or his hooue cloid with a naile, and such like, which properly may be called sorances or griefes. Thirdly, I talke of those diseases as wel outward as inward, that maie indifferently chance in anie part of the bdie, as of Impostumes, cankerous Vlcers, Woundes, Fistules, Bur∣ninges, Brousinges, Breaking of bones, and such like. Fourthly, because most diseases are healed either by letting of blood, by taking vp of vains, by purgation, or els by caute∣risation, that is to say, by giuing the fire: I talke of those foure necessary things seuerally by themselues; and finally, I shew you the true order of paring and shooing all man∣ner of hooues, according as the diuersity of hooues require: and to the intent you may the better vnderstand mee, you haue the perfect shapes of all necessary shooes, plainely set forth in figures before your eyes. Thus much touching mine order which I haue hitherto obserued. Now it is necessary to know, that to euery disease or malady, belongeth foure seuerall times, that is to say, the beginning, the increasing, the state, and declination, which times are diligently to be obserued of the Ferrer, because they require diuers applying of me∣dicine: for that medicine which was meete to be vsed in the beginning of the disease, per∣haps is not to be vsed in the declination thereof: and that which is requisite, and very needefull, to be applyed in the state or chiefest of the disease, may be very dangerous to be vsed in the beginning. And therefore the Ferrer ought to be a man of iudgement, and able to discerne one time from another, to the intent he may apply his medicines rightly. Hither of causes and sicknesse in generall. Now it is also meete, that we speake in generall of signes whereby sicknesse is knowne. Of the signes of sicknesse in generall. undevile S Icknesse according to the learned Physitians, is knowne foure man∣ner of waies: first by inseparable or substantiall accidents, as by the shape, number, quality, and sight of the part or member diseased. For if it bee otherwise formed, or more or lesse in number or quantity, or else otherwise placed then it ought to be, then it is not well. Secondly, sicknesse is knowne by alteration of the quality, as if it be too hot, or too cold, too moist, or too dry. Thirdly, when the action of any member is hurt or letted, as when the eie-sight is not perfect, it is a manifest signe that the eie is euill affected or sicke. Likewise, when there breedeth no good blood in the body, it is an euidēt token that the liuer is not wel. Fourth∣ly, sicknesse is known by the excrements that come from the beast, as by dung, or stale: for if his dung be too strong of sent, full of whole Cornes, or of Wormes, too hard or too soft, or euill coloured, it is a token that he is not well in his body: so likewise if his stale be too thicke, or too thinne, too white, or too red, it betokeneth some surfet, raw digesti∣on, or else some griefe in his reynes, bladder or stones. But Vegetius saith, that it is best knowne, whether a Horsse be sicke or not, or toward sicknesse, by these signes heere follo∣wing: for if he be more slow and heauy in his trotting, or gallopping, harder of Spurre, then he was woont to be, or spreadeth his litter abroad with his feete, often tumbling in the night season, fetching his breath short and violently, loud snuffling in the Nose, and c ting out vapors at his Nostrils, or lyeth downe immediatly after his prouender, or ma∣keth long draughts in his drinking, or in the night season is now downe, and now on foot, or if in the next morning he be very hot in his pasternes, or betwixt his eares, or that his eares hang more then they are wont to doe: againe, if his eye-sight be dim, and his eies hollow in his head, his haires standing right vp, and his flanks hollow and empty, whenso∣euer two or three of these signes doe concur together, then it is to be thought, saith Vege∣tius, that the Horsse is not well, and therefore hee would haue him immediatly to bee se∣parated from his companyons that bee whole, and to bee placed by himselfe vntill his disease bee perfectly knowne and cured, and especially if it bee any contagious dis∣ease. I haue seene diuers Ferrers heere in England to vse that for the triall of a Horsses sick∣nesse▪ which I neuer read in any Author, that is, to feele his stones, whether they be hot or cold, and to smell at his nostrils, and so by the sauour thereof to iudge what sicknesse the Horsse hath. Truely I thinke that no euill waie, if they can discerne with their sense of smelling, the diuersity of sauours, that commeth out of his Nostrils, and then aptly apply the same to the humours whereof such sauours bee bred, and so orderly to seeke out the originall cause of his sickenes. But I feare mee, that more Ferrers smell without iudgement, than with such iudgement, and no maruell why, sith that few or none be ler∣ned, or haue beene brought vp with skilful maisters. But from hence forth I trust that my trauaile, will cause such Ferrers as can read, and haue some vnderstanding already, to bee more diligent in seeking after knowledge then they haue bin heeretofore, whereby they shall be the better able to serue their countrey, and also to profit themselues, with good fame, wheras now for lacke of knowledge they incurre much slander. Of the Feauer and the diuers kinds thereof in a horsse. I Thinke it will seeme straunge vnto some, to heare that a horsse should haue an Ague or Feauer, but it was not strange vnto the men of olde time, as to Absyrtus, Hierocles, Blundev e Xenophon, Vegetius, and such like olde Souldiors, thoroughlie experimented in horsses griefes. A Feuer, according to the learned Phisitians, is an vnnaturall and immoderate heat, which proceeding first from the hart, spreadeth itselfe thoroughout all the arteries and vaines of the bodie, and so letteth the actions thereof. Of Feauers there be three generall kindes, whereof the first, is that which breedeth in the spirites, being inflamed or heated more than their nature requireth. The second breedeth in the humors, being also distempered by heat. The third in the firme parts of the body, being continually hot. What spirits and humors be, hath beene told you be∣fore in the keepers Office. Of these three generall kinds doe spring many other speciall kinds, as Quotidians, Tertians, Quartanes, Feauers Hectique, and very many others, whereunto mans body is subiect, whereof none of my Authors do treat, vnlesse Vegetius, who speaketh somewhat of a Feauer Quotidian, of a Feauer continuall, and also of a fea∣uer Accidentall. He speaketh also of Summer, Autumne, and Winter Feauers, without making any great difference betwixt them, more then that one is worse than another, by reason of the time and season of the yeare, so that in effect all is but one Feauer. Where∣fore according vnto Absirtus opinion, I will breefely shew you first the causes whereof it proceedes, and then the signes how to know it, and finally how to cure the same. The Feauer chaunceth sometime by surfetting of extreame labour or exercise, as of too much trauelling, and especially in hot weather, of too swift gallopping and running, and sometime by extreame heat of the Sunne, and also by extreame cold of the ayre, and sometime it breedeth of crudity or raw digestion, which many times happeneth by ouer greedy eating of sweet green corne, or of such prouender as was not throughly dried nor clensed: for after such greedy eating, and specially of such meat, neuer followeth perfect digestion. The signes to know a Feauer be these. The horsse doth continually hold downe his head, and is not able to lift it vp, his eies are euen blown so as hee cannot easily open them: yea and many times they be watering, the flesh of his lippes and of all his bodye is lush and feeble, his stones hange low, his body is hot, and his breath is very hotte and strong, he standeth weakly on his legges, and in his going draweth them lazily after him, yea hee cannot goe but very softly, and that staggering heere and there he will lie downe on his side, and is not able to turne himselfe or to wallow; he forsaketh his meat both hay and prouender, and is desirous of nothing but of drinke, which as Absirtus saith, is an as∣sured token of a Feauer: he also sleepeth but little. The cure and diet. Let him blood in the face and Temples, and also in the pallate of his mouth, and the first day giue him no meat, but onely warme drinke, and that by little and little. Afterward giue him continu∣ally grasse, or else very sweet hay wet in water, and let him be kept warme, and sometime walke him vppe and downe faire and softly in a temperate ayre, and then let him rest, and when you see that he beginnes to amend, giue him by little and little at once barly faire sifted and wel sodden, and also mundified, that is to say, the huske pulled awaye, like as when you blanch Almonds. Of diuers sorts of Feuers, according to Vigetius, and first of that which continueth but one day. T He Feauer of one day called by the Geeek name Ephemera, or els by the Latin name Diaria, chaunceth many times through the rashnesse and small discreti∣on of the keeper, or some other that letteth not to ride a horsse vnmeasura∣bly, either before or after watering, whereby the horsse afterward in the sta∣ble entreth into an extreame heate, and so falleth into his Feuer, which you shall know partly, by his waterish and bloodshotten eyes, and partly, by his short, violent and hot breathing, and panting. Moreouer, he will forsake his meate, and his Legs wil wax stiffe and feeble. The cure. Let him haue rest all the next day following, and be comforted with warme meate, then let him be walked vp and downe saite and softly, and so by little and little brought againe to his former estate. Of the Feauer continuall. THe Feuer continuall, is that which continueth without intermission, and is called in Italian by the Latine name Febris continua, which springeth of some inflamation or extreame heate, bredde in the principall members or inwarde partes, about the heart, which is knowne in this sort. The Horsse doth not take his accustomed rest, where∣by his flesh dothfal away euery day more and more, and sometime there doth appear hot inflamations in his flankes, and aboue his withers. The cure. Purge his head by squirting into his Nostrils mans vrine, or the Water of an Oxe that hath beene rested a certaine time, to the intent such water may be the stronger, and then giue him the drinke writen in the next Chapter. Of the Feuer taken in the Autumne, that is to say, at the fall of the leafe. IF a Horsse chance to get a Feauer at the fall of the leafe, cause him immediatly to be let blood in the necke vaine, and also in the third furrow of the roofe of his mouth, and then giue him this drinke. Take of Iermander foure ounces, of Gum dragant, and of dryed roses, of each one ounce, beat them all into fine powder, and put them into a quart of Ale, adding thereunto of Oyle oliue foure ounces, and of Hony as much, and giue it the Horsse lukewarme. Of the Feuer in Summer season. A Feuer taken in Summer season is much worse then in any other time, and especially if it be taken in the Dogge daies, for then the accidents be more furious. Blundevile The signes be these: his artires wil beate euidently, and hee will shed his seede when he staleth, and his going wil be vnorderly. The cure. Let him blood in a vaine that he hath in his hinder hanch, about foure fin∣gers beneath the fundament, or if you cannot finde that vaine, let him blood in the necke vaine, toward the withers, and if it be needefull you may giue him also this drinke. Take the iuyce of a handfull of Parslein mingled with Gum dragant, with Ensens, and a fewe Damaske roses, beaten all into fine powder, and then put thereunto a sufficient quantity of ale made sweete with Hony. Of the Feuer in winter. F Or the Feauer in Winter, it shall be good to take the powder of the drugs last mentioned, and with a quill or reede, to blowe it vp into his left Nostrill to make him to neese. It shall be good also to let him bloode in the necke vaine, Blundevile and in the palat of the mouth, and then to giue him one of these drinkes heere following. Take of Ireos sixe ounces, of round Pepper one ounce, of Bay-berries, and of the seede of Smallage, of each one ounce, and let him drinke them with sodden Wine. Or else take a pint of good Milke, and put therein of Oyle foure ounces, of Saffron one scruple, of Myrrhe two scruples, of the seede of Smallage a spoonefull, and make him drinke that: or make him this drinke. Take of Aristoloch, otherwise called round Hart∣wo t one ounce, of Gention, of Isop, of Wormwoode, of Sothernwood, of each one ounce, of dry fat Figs sixe ounces, of the seede of Smallage three ounces, of Rue a hand∣full, boile them all in a cleane vessell with Riuer Water, vntill the third part be consumed, and when you see it looke blacke and thicke, take it from the fire, straine it, and giue the Horsse to drinke thereof lukewarme. As touching his dyet, let his water be alwaies lukewarme, wherein would be put a little Wheat meale, and remember to giue him no meate so long as his fit continueth. And because in all Agues it is good to quicken the naturall heate of the Horsse, by rubbing and fretting his body, it shall not be amisse in some faire day to vse this friction, called of the ancient writers Apotorapie, which is made in this sort. Take of Damaske Roses one pound, of olde Oyle a pinte, of strong vineger a pinte and a halfe, of Mintes and Rue beaten into powder, of each one ounce and a halfe, together with one olde dry Nut, beate them and mingle them together, then being strained and made lukwarme, rub and chafeal the hor∣ses body therewith against the haire, vntill he beginneth to sweate, then set him vp in the warmest place of the stable, and couer him well. Of the Feuer which commeth of raw digestion, or of repletion. YOu shall know if the Feuer proceedeth of any such cause, by these signes heere fol∣lowing. The Horsse will blow at the nose more then hee is accustomed to doe, see∣meth to fetch his winde onely at his nose, and his breath will bee short, hot and dry; you shall see his flanks walke, and his backe to beate. The cure. Cause him to be let blood aboundantly in the head, and palat of his mouth, and by squirting warme vineger in the morning into his nostrils, force him to neese: and if hee bee costiue, let his fundament be raked, or else giue him a glister to ease the paine in his head. And as touching his dyet, giue him but little prouender, or hay, neither let him drink much nor often, but betwixt times. But in any wise let him be well rubbed and chafed, and that a good while together, and if you vse the friction declared in the last chapter before in such sort as there is said, it shall do him very much good. Of the Feuer accidentall comming of some vlcer in the mouth or throat. THe Horsse not being well kept and gouerned, after that he hath beene let blood in the vpper partes: yea, and also besides that of his owne nature is subiect vnto the distillation in his throate, or partes there about, the painefull swelling or vlcer wher∣of, causeth the Horsse to fall into a grieuous Ague. Whereof, besides the former reme∣dies apt to purge humors, it shall be necessary also, to let him bloode in the vaine of the head, and in the palat of his mouth, and to bee short in all those places where the disease causeth most griefe. And if the Horsse bee so sore pained as he cannot swallow downe his meate, it shall bee good to giue him lukewarme water, mingled with Barly meale, or wheat meale, and besides that, to make him swallow downe seuen sops sopped in wine one after another, at one time: some vse at the second time to dip such sops in sweet sallet oile. Thus far Vegetius. Of the Pestilent Ague. IT seemeth by Laurentius Russius, that Horsses be also subiect to a pestilent feuer, which almost incureable, Blundevile is called of him Infirmitas Epidimialis, that is to say, a contagious and pestiferous disease, whereof there dyed in one yeare in Rome aboue a thousand Hor∣ses, which as I take it came by some corruption of the aire, whereunto Rome in the chiefe of Summer is much subiect, or else corrupt humors in the body ingendered by vnkinde food, by reason perhaps, that the City was then pestered with more horse-men then there could be conueniently harbored or fed. Laurentius himselfe rendereth no cause therof, but onely sheweth signes how to know it, which be these. The Horsse holdeth down his head, eateth little or nothing, his eyes waterish, and his flanks doe continually beat. The cure. First giue him this glister. Take of the pulpe of Coloquintida one ounce, of Dragantum one ounce and a halfe, of Centuary and Wormwood, of each one handfull, of Castoreum halfe an ounce, boile them in water, then being strained, dissolue therein, of Gerologun∣dinum sixe ounces, of salt an ounce and a halfe, and halfe a pound of Oyle oliue, and mi∣nister it lukewarme with a horne, or pipe made of purpose. Make also this plaister for his head: take of Squilla fiue ounces, of Elder, of Castoreum, of Mustard seed and of Euforbi∣um, of each two ounces, dissolue the same in the iuyce of Daffodill, and of Sage, and laie it to the Temples of his head next vnto his eares, or else giue him any of these three drinks heere following; take of the best Triacle two or three ounces, and distemper it in good wine, and giue it him with a horne; or else let him drinke euery morning the space of three daies, one pound or two of the iuyce of Elder rootes, or else giue him euery morning to eate, a good quantity of Venus haire, called of the Latines Capillus Veneris, newly and fresh gathered, but if it be old then boile it in water, and giue him the decoction thereof to drink with a horne. Martins opinion and experience touching a Horsses Feuer. T Hough Martin haue not seene so many seuerall kindes of feuers, to chance to Horsses, Blundevile yet he confesseth that a Horsse will haue a feauer, and saith that you shal know it by these signes. For after the Horsse hath beene sicke two or three daies, if you looke on his tongue, you shall see it almost raw and scalt, with the heate that coms out of his body, and he wil shake and trem∣ble, reele and stagger when his fit commeth, which fit wil keepe his due howers, both of comming and also of continuance, vnlesse you preuent it by putting the horsse into a heat, which would be done so soone as you see him begin to tremble, either by riding him, or tying vp his Legs, and by chasing him vp and downe in the stable, vntil he leaue shaking, and then let him be kept warm, and stand on the bit the space of two houres, that done, you may giue him some hay, by a little at once, and giue him warme water, with a litle ground mault twice a day, the space of three or foure daies, and once a day wash his tongue with Alom water, vineger, and Sage. But if you see that all this preuailes not, then purge him with this drinke, after that he hath fasted al one night. Take of Aloes one ounce, of Aga∣ricke halfe an ounce, of Lycoras and Annis seedes of each a dram, beaten to powder, and let him drinke it with a quart of white wine lukewarme, and made sweet with a little Hony, in the morning fasting, and let him be chafed a little after it, and be kept warme, and suffe∣red to stand on the bit meatlesse two or three houres after, and he shall recouer his health againe quickly. Of sicknesse in generall, and the Feuer. I N general, sicknes is an opposit foe to nature, warring against the agents of the body and minde, seeking to confound those actions which vphold and maintaine the bodies strength and liuely-hood: Markham. Who coueteth to haue larger definition of sicknesse, let him reade Vegesius Rusius, or excellent Maister Blundiuile, who in that hath bin admirably well-deseruing plainefull. For mine owne part, my in∣tent is to write nothing more then mine own experience, and what I haue approued in Horsses diseases most auaileable: and first of the Feuer or Ague in a Horsse, though it bee a disease seldome or not at all noted by our Me∣channicall Horsse Farriors, who cure many times what they know no , and kill wher they might cure, knew they the cause: yet I haue my selfe seene of late (both by the demon∣strate opinions of others better learned, and by the effects of the disease) some two Hor∣ses which I dare auouch were mightily tormented with a Feauer: though diuers Leeches had thereof giuen diuers opinions, one saying it was the bots, by reason of his immode∣rate languishment: another affirmed him to be bewitcht, by reason of his great shaking, heauinesse, and sweating: but I haue found it and approued it to be a Feuer, both in effect, nature, and quality, the cure whereof is thus: for the originall cause of a Feuer, is surfet, breeding putrifaction in the blood: then when his shaking beginneth, take three new laide Egges, breake them in a dish, and beate them together, then mixe thereto fiue or sixe spoonefuls of excellent good Aqua vitae, and giue it him in a horne, then bridle him, and in some Close or Court, chafe him til his shaking cease and he beginne to sweat: then set him vp and cloath him warme. And during the time of his sicknesse, giue him no water to drinke, but before he drinke it, boile therein Mallowes, Sorrell, Purslaine, of each two or three handfuls. As for his foode, let it bee sodden Barly, and now and then a little Rye in the sheafe to clense and purge him, chiefely if he be drye inwardly and grow costiue. This I haue pro∣ued vneffectlesse for this disease, and also much auaileable for any other inward sicknesse proceeding either of raw digestion, too extreame riding, or other surfet. Diuers haue written diuersly of diuers Agues, and I coulde prescribe receiptes for them, but since I haue not been experimented in them al, I meane to omit them, intending not to exceede mine owne knowledge in any thing. Of the Pestilence. T He Pestilence is a contagious disease, proceeding as Pelagonius saith, som∣time of ouermuch labour, heate, colde, hunger, aad sometime of sudden running after long rest, or of the retention or holding of stale or vrine, Blundevile or of drinking colde water whiles the Horsse is hot and sweating, for all these things do breede corrupt humors in the Horsses body, whereof the Pesti∣lence doth chiefely proceede, or else of the corruption of the aire, poysoning the breath, whereby the Beastes should liue, which also happeneth sometime of the corruption of e∣euill vapors and exhalations that spring out of the earth, and after great floodes or earth∣quakes, and sometime by meanes of some euill distillation or influence of the Planettes, corrupting sometime the plants and fruits of the earth, and sometime diuers kinde of cat∣tell, and sometime both men, Women and children, as wee daiely see by experience. It seemeth that this euill or mischiefe in times paste came suddenly, without giuing any war∣ning, for none of mine Authors doth declare any signes how to know whether a Horsse hath this disease or not, but onely affirme, that if one Horsse do▪ die of it, al his fellowes that beare him company will follow after, if they bee not remedied in time: so that as far as I can learne, the sudden death of one or two, first, must bee the onely meane to knowe that this disease doeth reigne. And the remedy that they giue is this. First separate the whole from the sicke: yea, and haue them cleane out of the aire of those that be dead, the bodies whereof as Vegetius saith, if they be not deep buried, will infect al the rest. And let them blood as wel in the neck, as in the mouth, & then giue them this drink: take of Gen∣tian, of Aristoloch, of Bay berries, of Myrrhe, of the scraping of Iuory, of each like quan∣tity, beate them into fine powder, and giue as well to the sicke as to the whole, whome you would preserue from this contagion, euery day a spoonefull or two of this powder in a pinte of good wine, so long as you shall see it needefull. This medicine before rehear∣sed, is called of the ancient writers Diapente, that is to say: a composition of fiue simples, and is praised to be a soueraigne medicine and preseruatiue against al inward diseases, and therefore they would haue such as trauell by the way, to carty of this powder alwaies a∣bout them. There be many other Medicines which I leaue to write, because if I should rehearse euery mans medicine, my booke would be infinite, I for my part would vse no other then either that before expressed, or else wine and treacle onely. Of the diseases in the head. Blundevile THe head is subiect to diuers diseases according to the diuers partes thereof: for in the pannicles or little fine skins cleaning to the bones, and couering the braine, do most properly breed headach and migram. Againe in the substance of the braine (which in a Horsse is as much in quantity as is almost the braine of a meane hog) do breede the Frensie, madnesse, sleeping euill, the palsey and forgetfulnesse. Finally, in the ventri∣cles or celles of the braine, and in those conducts through which the spirits annimall doe giue feeling and mouing to the body, do breede the turnsick or staggers, the faling euill, the night mare, the Apoplexy, the palsie, and the conuulsion or Cramp, the Catarre or Rheume, which in a Horsse is called the Glaunders, but first of headach. Of headeach. THe headeach, either commeth of some inward causes: as of some cholerick humor, bred in the pannicles of the braine, or else of som outward cause, as of extream heat or cold, of some blow, or of some violent sauour. Eumelus saith, that it commeth of raw digestion: but Martin saith most commonly of cold: the signes be these. The Horsse will hang downe his head, and also hang downe his eares, his sight will be dimme, his eies swollen and waterish, and he will forsake his meat. The cure. Let him bloode in the palat of his mouth. Also purge his head with this perfume. Take of Garlike stalkes a handfull, all to broken in short pieces, and a good quantity of Frankencense, and being put into a chafingdish of fresh coales, holde the chafingdish vnder the Horsses Nostrils, so as the fume may ascende vp into his head: and in vsing him thus once or twice, it wil make him to cast at the nose, and so purge his head of al filth. Pelogonius saith, that it is good to pouer into his Nostrils wine, wherein hath beene sodden Euforbium, Centuary, and Franken∣cence. Of the frenzy and madnesse of a Horse. T He learned Physicians do make diuers kindes, as well of frensie, as of mad∣nesse, which are not needefull to be recited, sith I could neuer read in any Author, nor learne of any Ferrer, that a horsse were subiect to the one halfe of them. Absiruus, Hierocles, Eumelus, Pelagonius, and Hippocrates, do write simply de furore & rabie : that is to say, of the madnesse of a Horsse. But in∣deede vegetius in his second booke of horseleach-craft, seemeth to make foure mad passi∣ons belonging to a Horsse, intituling his Chapters in this sort, de Appioso, de Frenetico, de Cardiacis, de Rabioso, the effects wherof though I feare me it wil be to no great purpose, yet to content such as perhaps haue read the Author as wel as I my selfe, I wil heere briefly re∣hearse the same. When some naughty blood (saith he) doth strike the filme or pannacle of the brain, in one part onely, and maketh the same grieuously to ake, then the beast becommeth Appi∣osum, that is to say, as it seemeth by his owne words next following, both dul of mind and of sight. This word Appiosum, is a strange word, and not to be found againe in any other Author, and because in this passion, the one side of the head is onely grieued, the Horsse turneth round, as though he went in a Mill. But when the poyson of such corrupt blood doth infect the mid braine, then the Horse becommeth Frantike, and will leape and fling, and wil run against the wals. And if such blood filleth the vaines of the stomach, or breast, then it infecteth as well the heart as the brain, and causeth alienation of mind, and the bo∣dy to sweate, and this disease is called of Vegetius, Passocardiaca, which if Equus Appiosus chance to haue, then he becommeth Rabiosus, that is to say, starke mad. For saith he, by ouermuch heat of the liuer and blood, the vaines, and artires of the heart are choked vp, for griefe and paine whereof the Horsse biteth himselfe, and gnaweth his owne flesh. Of two sorts of mad horses, I beleeue I haue seene my selfe heere in this Realme. For I saw once a black Sweathland Horsse (as I tooke him to be) in my Lord of Hunsdons stable at Hunsdon, comming thither by chance with my Lord Morley, which Horsse would stand all day long biting of the manger, and eat little meate or none, suffering no man to aproch vnto him, by which his doings, and partly by his colour and complexion, I iudged him to be vexed with a melancholy madnesse, called of the Physitians, Mania, or rather Melancholia, which commeth of a corrupt Melancholy, and filthy blood or humor, som∣time spred throughout al the vaines of the body, and sometimes perhaps remaining only in the head, or else in the spleene, or places next adioyning. The other mad Horsse was a Roane of Maisters Ashleies, maister of the Iewell house, which with his teeth crushed his maisters right forefinger in pieces, whilest he offered him a little hay to eate, whereby hee lost in a manner the vse of his whole hand, to the great griefe of al his friends, and also of al the muses, which were wont to be much delighted with such passing sweete musick as that his fine quauering hand could sometime make vpon diuers instrumentes, but especially vpon the Virginals. This Horsse I say though he could eat his meat, drinke his drink, and sleepe: yet if hee were neuer so little offended, he would take on like a spirit, and both bite and strike at any man that came nigh him: yea and would bite himselfe by the shoulders most terribly, pul¦ling away lumps of flesh, so broad as a mans hand: and whensoeuer he was ridden, he was faine to be musled with a mussell of iron, made of purpose to keep him from biting either of his rider or himselfe, which no doubt proceeded of some kinde of frenzy or madnes, whereunto the Horsse was subiect, by meanes that hotblood (as I take it) abounded ouer∣much in him. But now as touching the causes, signes, and cure of Horsses madnesse, you shal heare the opinion of old writers: for Martin neuer tooke such cure in hand. Absirtus, and the other Authors before mentioned say, that the madnesse of a Horsse commeth ei∣ther by meanes of some extreame heat taken by traueling, or long standing in the hot sun, or else by eating ouer many fitches, or by some hot bloode resorring to the pannicles of the brain, or through aboundance of choler remaining in the vaines, or else by drinking of some very vnwholsome water. The signes bee these, he wil bite the manger, and his owne body, and run vpon euery man that comes nigh him, he will continually shake his eares, and stare with his eies, and fome at the mouth: and also as Hipocrates saith, hee will forsake his meat and pine himselfe with hunger. The cure. Cause him to be let blood in his Legs aboundanly, which is doone (as I take it) to diuert the bloode from his head. Notwithstanding it were not amisse, to let him blood in the Neck and brest vains. Then giue him this drinke: take the roots of wild Cow∣cumber, and boile it in harsh red wine, & put thereunto a litle Nitre, and giue it him with a horn lukwarm: or if you can get no Cucumber, then take Rue, & Mints, and boile them in the wine. It were not amisse also to adde thereunto a handfull of blacke Elleborus, for that is a very good herbe against madnes. Eumelius saith, that if you giue him mans dung in wine to drink 3. mornings together, it wil heale him: also to take of black Elleborus 2. or 3. handfuls, & boile it in a sufficient quantity of strong vineger, & therwith rub and chafe both his head and all his body once or twice a day, for the oftner his head is rubbed the better, and often exercise is very profitable to al his body. Some againe would haue the skin of his head to be pierced in diuers places with an hot iron, to let out the euill humors: but if none of all this will preuaile, then the last remedy is to geld him of both his stones, or else of one at the least, for either that wil heale him or else nothing. As touching the di∣et and vsage of a mad Horsse, the Authors doe not agree, for some would haue him kept in a close, darke and quiet house, voyde from all noise, which as Absirtus saith, will either make him madder, or else kill him out of hand. His diet would be thin, that is to say: with∣out any prouender, and that daie that he is let blood and receiueth his drinke, they would haue him fast vntill euen, and then to haue a warme mash of Barly meale: yea, methinkes it were not amisse to feed him only with warm mashes and hay, and that by a little at once vntill he be somewhat recouered. Another of the Head-ache. Markham. THe Head-ache as most are opynionated, proceedeth of cold and rast digestion, the cure is, take a Goose feather annointed with Oyle de bay, and thrust it vp into the horsses nostrils, to make him neese, then take a wreath of Pease-straw or wet hay, and putting fire thereunto, hold it vnder the horsses nose, so as the smoke may ascend vp into his head, then being thus perfumed, take a knife and pricke him in the pallat of the mouth, so as he may licke vp and chaw his own blood, which done, haue great care in keeping his head warme, and doubt not his recouery. Of the sleeping euill. Blundevile THis is a disease forcing the beast continually to sleepe, whether he wil or not, taking his memory and appetite cleane away, and therefore is called of the Physitians Le∣thargus, it proceedeth of aboundance of flegme moistening the brain ouermuch It is easie to know it, by the continuall sleeping of the Horsse. The cure of this disease ac∣cording to Pelagonius, Vegetius, and others, is in this sort. Let him bloode in the necke, and then giue him this drinke: Take of Camomile and Motherwort, of each two or three handfuls, and boile them in a sufficient quantity of water, and put thereunto a little wheat bran, salt and vineger, and let him drinke a pinte of that euery day, the space of three or foure daies together. It is good also to perfume and chafe his hed, with Time & Peniroy∣all sodden together in vineger, or with Brimstone and feathers burned vpon a chafingdish of coales vnder his nose: and to prouoke him to neese, by blowing pepper and Pyrethre beaten to powder, vp into his nostrils: yea and to annoint the palate of his mouth, with Hony and Mustard mingled together, and in his drinke, which would be alwaies warme water, to put Parsly seede, and Fennell seede, to prouoke vrine. His Legs also would bee bathed, and his hooues filled with wheat bran, salt, and vineger, sodden togither, and laid too so hot as hee may indure it, and in any case suffer him not to sleepe but keepe him waking and stirring, by continual crying vnto him, or pricking him with some sharp thing that cannot passe through the skin, or else by beating him with a whip, and this doing he shall recouer. Another of the sleeping euill. Markham. THe sleeping euil in a horsse, differeth nothing from that which the Physitians cal the Lethargy in men, for it prouoketh the horsse to sleep continually, without disisting, robbing his memory and appetite of their qualities: the knowledge thereof is easily knowne by his drowsinesse, and the cure in this sort: Let one stand by him, and either with fearefull noise or stripes, perforce keepe him waking: then let him bloode vnder the eies, and in the necke, and then take a leafe or two of the best Tobacco, which being dryed and beaten to powder, with a quill blow it vp into his nostrils, and giue him to drinke vineger, salt, and Mustard mingled well together, to which if you put a little Honye, it shall not be amisse: and also when he drinketh any water, put thereto either Fennel-seedes, Anny-seedes or Pepper. Of a Horsse that is taken. A Horsse is said to be taken, when he is depriued of his feeling and mouing, Blundevile so as he is able to stir no manner of way, but remaineth in such state and forme, as he was taken in. Which disease is called of the Physitians by the Greeke name Catalepsis, and in Latine Deprehensio, or Congelatio and of Vegetius, Sideratio, which also calleth those beasts that haue this disease I enta sideratitia. The physitians say, that it commeth of aboun∣dance of Phlegme and choler mixt together, or else of melancholy blood, which is a cold dry humor opressing the hinder parts of the brain. But Vegetius saith, that it coms of some extreame outward cold, striking sodainely into the empty vaines, or some extreame heate or raw digestion, or else of some great hunger, caused by long fasting. It is easie to knowe by the description before mentioned. As touching the cure, Vegetius saith, that if it come of colde, then it is good to giue him to drinke, one ounce of Laserpitium, with Wine and Oyle mixt together, and made lukewarme: if of heat, then to giue it him with water and hony: if of crudity, then to hea e him by fasting: if of hunger, then by feeding him well with Pease. But Martin saith, that this disease is called of the French-men Surprins, and it commeth (as he saith) most chiefly of cold taken after a heat, & he wisheth a horsse that is thus taken, to be cured in this sort. First to be let blood on both sides of the breast, and then to be put in a heat either by con∣tinuall stirring and molesting him, or else if he wil stir by no meanes, then to bury him all saue the head in a warme dunghil, and ther to let him lie vntil his limbs haue some feeling. And before you so bury him, it shall be good to giue him this drinke. Take of Malmsie three pints, and put thereunto a quarterne of Suger, and some Cinamon and Cloues, and let him drinke it good and warme, and vntill he be perfectly whole, let him be kept warm, and often exercised and walked vp and down in the stable, and thinly dieted, and drink no∣thing but warme water, wherein if you put some Fennell and Parsly seed, to prouoke him to vrine, it shal be the better. And if he cannot dung, let him bee raked, and haue a glister made of the broath of Mallowes and fresh Butter. Another of a Horsse that is taken. A Horsse which is bereft of his feeling, moouing or stirring, is said to be taken, and in sooth so he is, in that he is arrested by so vallainous a disease, yet some Farriors, Markham. not wel vnderstanding the ground of the disease, conster the word taken, to bee striken by some Plannet or euill spirit, which is false, for it proceedeth of too great aboundance of fleme and choler, simboliz'd together, the cure is thus. Let him blood in his spur vains, and his breast vaines, and then by foulding him in aboundant number of cloaths, driue him into an extreame sweat, during which time of his sweating, let one chafe his legs with oyle de bay, then after he hath sweat the space of two houres, abate his cloaths moderatly, and throughly after he is dry, annoint him all ouer with Oyle Petrolium, and in twice or thrice dressing him he wil be sound. Of the Staggers. THis is a dizzinesse of the head, called in Latine vertigo, and of the Italians as I re∣member Capistura. It commeth of some corrupt bloode, Blundevile or grosse and tough hu∣mors oppressing the brain, from whence proceedeth a vaporous spirit, dissolued by a weake heat, which troubleth all the head. The signes be these; dimnesse of sight, the ree∣ling and staggering of the Horsse, who for very pain wil thrust his head against the walles, and forsake his meate. The cure according to Martin is thus. Let him blood in the temple vaines, and then with a knife make an hole an inch long ouerwart his forehead, hard vnderneath his fore-top, and raise the skinne with a Cornet, thrusting it vpward towards the head-stale a good handfull, and then put in a taint dipt in Turpentine and hogs greace molten together, renewing the taint euery day once vntill it be whole, and do the like vpon the ridge of the rumpe, but methinkes it were better to do the like, in the powle of his head, or nape of his necke, for so should the euil humors haue both waies the easier and speedier passage: and as touching his dyet, let him haue conti∣nually warme drinke, and mashes, and once a day be walked vp and downe faire and softly to exercise his body. Of the Staggers. THe Staggers is a dizy disease, breeding frenzy in a Horsse, which if it be not instant∣ly helped, Markham. is mortall: the cure is thus. Let him blood in the temple vaines, and then aply to his temples cloath in the iuyce of Garlike, and Aqua vitae mixt together: if you crush Garlike and put it in his eares, it is excellent: or if you slit his forehead, and loosening the skin from the bone, taint it with Turpentine and Sallet-oyle, it will vndoub∣tedly help him. Of the falling euill. Blundevile THis is a kind of convulsion or crampe, called of the Latins by the Greek name Epi∣lepsia, in Italian, Il morbo caduco, depriuing the beast at certaine times, and for a cer∣taine space of the vse of feeling, hearing and seeing, and of al the other senses. And although it be a disease that hath bin seldome seene to chance vnto Horses of this Coun∣trey, yet it appeareth by Absirtus, and also by Vegetius, and diuers others, that Horsses be subiect therunto. For Absirtus writing to his friend Tiberius Claudius saith, that vnto hor∣ses chanceth many times the falling sicknesse. The signes whereof are these. The Horsse will fall down suddenly, partly through the resolution of his members, and partly through distension of his sinnewes, and al his body will quiuer and quake, and somtime he wil fome at the mouth. Vegetius againe writeth in this sort: by a certain course of the Moone hor∣ses and other beasts many times do fal, and die for a time as wel as men. The signs wherof are these. Being fallen, their bodies will quiuer and quake, and their mouths will fome, and when a man would thinke that they would die out of hand, they rise suddenly vp and fal to their meat. And by feeling the gristle of their Nostrils with your finger, you shall know whether they wil fal often or not: for the more cold the gristle be, the oftner, and the lesse cold it be, the seldomer, they wil fal. The cure. Let him bloode aboundantly in the necke vaines, and within fiue daies after let him blood againe in the temple vaines and let him stand in a warme and darke stable, and an∣noint al his body with comfortable ointments, and his head and eares with Oyle of Bay, and liquid Pitch or Tar, mingled together. And also put some therof into his eares, and and then make a Biggen for him of some soft warm skin, as of a sheepes skin, or els of can∣uas, stuffed vnderneath with woll, and make him this purging drink. Take of Radish roots two ounces, of the root of the herb called in Latine Panax or Panaces, and of Scammony, of each one ounce, beate al these things together, and boile them in a quart of Hony, and at sundry times as you shal see it needefull, giue him a good spoonefull or two of this in a quart of Ale lukewarme, whereunto would be put three or foure spoonefuls of oyle. It is good also to blow the powder of Motherwort, or of Pyrethrum, vp into his nostrils, and if the disease do continue stil for al this, then it shal be needeful to pearse the skinne of his forehead in diuers places with a hot iron, and to let out the humors oppressing his braine. of the night Mare. THis is a disease oppressing either man or beast in the night season when he sleepeth, so as he cannot drawe his breath, and is called of the Latines Incubus. It commeth of a continual crudity or raw digestion of the stomach, from whence grosse vapors ascending vp into the head, do oppresse the braine, and al the sensitiue powers, so as they cannot do their office, in giuing perfect feeling and mouing to the body. And if this dis∣ease chancing often to a man, be not cured in time, it may perhaps grow to a worse mis∣chiefe, as to the faling euil, madnesse, or Apopelexy. But I could neuer learne that Hor∣ses were subiect to this disease, neither by relation, nor yet by reading, but only in an old English writer, who sheweth neither cause nor signes, how to know when a horsse hath it, but onely teacheth how to cure it with a fond foolish charme, which because it may per∣haps make you gentle Reader to laugh, as wel as it did me, for recreation sake I will heere rehearse it. Take a flint stone that hath a hole of his owne kinde, and hang it ouer him, and write in a bill. In nomine patris, &c. Saint George our Ladies Knight, He walked day, so did he night, Vntill he her found, He her beate, and he her bound, Till truely her troath she him plight, That she would not come within the night, There as saint George our Ladies knight, Named was three times, saint George. And hang this scripture ouer him, and let him alone: with such proper charmes as this is, the false Friers in times past were wont to charme the mony out of plaine folks purses. Of the Apoplexy. THe Apoplexy, is a disease depriuing all the whole body of sense and mouing. And if it depriue but part of the body, then it is called of the Latines by the Greeke name Paralysis, in our tongue a palsie. It proceedes of cold, grosse, and tough humors, Blundevile op∣pressing the braine all at once, which may breed partly of crudities and raw digestion, and partly by meanes of some hurt in the head, taken by a fall, stripe, or otherwise. As touch∣ing Apoplexy, few or none writing of horsleach-craft do make any mention thereof: but of the Palsie Vegetius writeth in this manner. A Horsse (saith he) may haue the palsie as wel as a man, which is knowne by these signes. He will go grouelling and sideling like a Crab, carrying his necke awry, as if it were broken, and goeth crookedly with his legs, beating his head against the wals and yet forsaketh not his meate nor drink, and his prouender see∣meth moist and wet. The cure. Let him blood in the temple vaine, on the contrary side of the wrying of his necke, and annoint his necke with comfortable ointment, and splent it with splents of wood to make it stand right, and let him stand in a warme stable, and giue him such drinks as are recited in the next chapter following. But if all this profiteth not, then draw his necke with a hot yron on the contrary side: that is to say, on the whole side, from the neather part of the eare downe to the shoulders, and draw also a good long strike on his temple, on that side and on the other temple make him a little star in this sort,* and from his raines to his mid backe, draw little lines, in a manner of a ragged staffe, and that will heale him. Of the Crampe or convulsion of the sinnewes. and Muscles. A Conuulsion or crampe, is a forceable and painefull contraction or drawing toge∣ther of the sinnewes and Muscles which doe happen sometime through the whole body, and sometime but in one part or member only. And according as the body may be diuersely drawne, so do the Physitians, and also mine Authors that write of horse∣leach craft, giue it diuers names. For if the body be drawne forward, then they call it in Greeke Emprosthotonos, in Latine Tensio ad anteriora. And if the body be drawne backe, it is called in Greeke Opisthotonos, in Latine Tensio ad pesteriora. But if the body be starke and straite, bowing neither forward, nor backward, then it is called simply in Greeke Tetanos, in Latine Distensio or Rigor: which names also are appli∣ed to the like conuulsions of the necke. Notwithstanding, Vegetius writing of this diease, in ituleth his chapters de Roborosis, a strange terme, and not to be found againe in any o∣ther A thor. A conuulsion as I said before, may chance as well to one part or member of the body, as to the whole body: as to the eie, to the skin of the forehead, to the rootes of the to gue, to the iawes, to the lips, to the arme, hand or Legge: that is to say, whensoe∣uer the sinnew or muscle seruing to the moouing of that part, is euill affected or grieued. Of which conuulsions, though ther be many diuers causes: yet Hippocrates bringeth them all into two: that is to say, into fulnesse and emptinesse: for when a conuulsion procee∣deth either of some inflamation of superfluous eating or drinking, or for lacke of due pur∣gation, or of ouermuch rest and lacke of exercise, all such causes are to be referred to re∣ple ion or fulnesse. But if a conuulsion come by means of ouermuch purging or bleeding, or much watching, extreame labor, long fasting, or by wounding or pricking of the sin∣newes, then al such causes are to be referred vnto emptinesse. And if the conuulsion pro∣ceede of fulnesse, it chanceth suddenly, and all at once, but if of emptynesse, then it com∣meth by little and little, and leisurely. Besides these kindes of conuulsions, there is also chancing many times in a mans sin∣gers, Legges and toes, another kind of conuulsion, which may bee called a windye con∣uulsion, for that it proceedes of some grosse or tough vapor, entred into the braunches of the sinnewes, which maketh them to swell like a Lute string in moyst weather, which though it be very painefull for the time, yet it may bee soone driuen away, by chafing or rubbing the member grieued with a warme cloath. And this kind of conuulsion or cramp chanceth also many times to a Horsses hinder Legs, standing in the stable. For I haue seene some my selfe, that haue had one of their hinder Legges drawne vp with the crampe almost to the belly so stiffe and hard, as no man hath beene able to stir it, neither could the Horsse himselfe set it0 down to the ground of a long season, which I think might be soone remedied: first by continuall chafing, fretting, or rubbing his Legs with a good wispe, and then by tying vp the other hinder Legge, or else the forelegge on the fore side, when by he should be forced to set down the pained Leg. Thus far I haue discour∣sed of the conuulsion of sinnewes, and of the causes therof, according to the opinions of the learned Physitians. Now I wil briefly shew you the causes, signes, and cure thereof, according to the doctrine of mine Authors that write of horseleach-craft. Absirtus saith, that this disease doeth come, either by driuing the Horsse into a sweate when he halteth, or for that he hath troden vpon some naile, or by taking cold after iour∣nying and sweating in Winter season, whereby his lippes are clung together, or by long lying and rest after sweating, whereby the sinnewes of his forelegges be nummed, or by hauing some stripe of his priuy members, or by long trauelling in the colde Mountaines, where snowe and Ise doth abound. For Theomnestus Writeth, that comming out of Pao∣nia, with the King and his army, and passing ouer the Mountaines to goe into Italy, there fell such aboundance of snow, as not onely many Souldiers dyed, sitting still on their hor∣ses backs, with their Weapons in their handes, being so starke and stiffe, and cleauing so fast to their Saddles, as they cold not easily be pulled out of them: but also diuers horsses in their going were so nummed as they could not bow their legs: yea and some were found s arke dead, standing stil on their feete, and few Horsses or none escaped at that time free from this conuulsion, of sinnewes, insomuch that Theomnestus his owne Horsse which he loued dearely, was sore vexed therewith. The signes to know whether a Horsse bee trou∣bled with the conuulsion in the sinnewes or not, bee these. His head and necke will be so stiffe and starke as hee can bow it no manner of way, his eares wil stand right vp, and his eies will be hollow in his head, and the fleshy parts therof in the great corners, will be turned backward, his lips will be clung fast together, so as hee cannot open his mouth, and his tongue so nummed as he can neither eate nor drinke, his backbone and taile wil be so stiffe, as he cannot moue it one way nor other, and his Legs so stiffe, as they will not bow, and being layed hee is not able to rise, and specially on his hinder Legges, but falleth downe on his buttockes, like a Dogge when hee sitteth on the ground, and by meanes of the conuulsion in his backe, his bladder also for neighbour∣hoode sake, suffereth, whereby the Horsse cannot stale but with great paine. The cure. Put him into a sweat, either by burying him all saue the head in some warme dunghill, or if he be a horsse of price, cary him into a hot house, where is no smoak, and let him sweat there. Then annoint all his body, heade, necke, legges, and all with oyle of Cypres, and oile of Bay mingled together. Or else with one of these ointments. Take of Hogs-greace two pound, of Turpentine halfe a pound, of Pepper beaten in powder one dramme, of new Wax one pound, of olde Oyle two pound, boile all these together, and being made very warme, annoint all his body therewith. Or els with this ointment. Take of new wax one pound, of Turpentine foure ounces, of oile de Bay as much, of Opopanax two oun∣ces, of Deeres sewet and oile of Storar, of each three ounces, melt al these together, and annoint all his body therewith. It is good also to bath his head with the decoction of Fitches, or els of Lupines, and make him this drink. Take xx. graines of long Pepper, finely beaten into powder, of Ce∣dar two ounces, of Nitre one ounce, of Lacerpitium as much as a Beane, and mingle all these together with a sufficient quantity of white Wine; and giue him thereof to drinke a quart euery Morning and Euening for the space of three or foure daies, or else this drink. Take of Opopanax two ounces, of Storar three ounces, of Gentian three ounces, of Man∣na Succ rie, three ounces, of Myr one scruple, of long Pepper two scruples, giue him this with old Wine; or make him a drinke of Lacerpitium, Cumin, Annis seed, Fenegreeke, Bay berries, and old oyle. In old time they were wont to let him bloode in the Temples, which Absirtus doth not alow, saying that it will cause the sinnewes of his lips to dry vp, so as the horsse being not able to moue them, shall pine for hunger. As touching his diet, giue him at the first warm mashes, and such soft meat as he may easily get down, and wet haie, bringing him to har∣der food by little and little. And in any case, let him be kept very warme, and ridden or walked once a day to exercise his legges and lims. Theomnestus cured his horsse, as he sai∣eth, by placing him in a warm stable, and by making a cleer fire without any smoak round about him, and the horsse not being able to open his iawes of himselfe, hee caused his mouth to be opened, and put therein sops dipt in a confection called Entrigon conditum, and also annointed al his bodie with a medicine or ointment called Acopum (the making whereof herafter followeth) dissolued in Cypres oile, which made him to fal into a sweat, and being before halfe dead and more, brought him againe to his feeling and mouing, so as he did rise and eat his meat. Of the Crampe or convulsions of the Sinnewes or Muscles. A Convulsion or cramp, is a forcible drawing together of the sinnewes, sometimes vniuersally ouer the whole body, as I haue seene one horsse in my life time, and sometimes but in one part or member, as I haue knowne and helpt diuers. These convulsions haue two grounds, name∣ly, either natural, or els accidental: natural, as proceeding of cold win∣die humours ingendred in the body, and dispersed into those partes, worke there the effects of greeuance. Accidental, is by wounding or pricking the sinnews of which immediatly ensueth a convulsion. If it be naturall, and the disease generally dis∣persed; then the cure is thus: dig a great deep hole in some old dunghil, & there bury him all saue the head, so he may sweate there for the space of two houres at the least, then take him out, and annoint his body all ouer with Narueoile, Turpentine, and Deares su∣et mingled together on the fire, and bathe his heade in the iuice of Rue and Camo mile. Then giue him to drinke old Ale brewd with Sinamon, Ginger, Fenecreeke and long Pepper: of each three ounces. As for his dyet, let it be warme mashes, sodden wheat and hay, thoroughly carded with a paire of wool cards: let him be kept verie warme and ay∣red abroad once a daie at the least. If this convulsion be not onely in one member, then it is sufficient if euery daye with hard ropes of hay or straw you rub and chafe that part exceedingly, and apply there to a little quantity of the oyle Pepper. If the convulsion be accidentall, proceeding of some hurt, whereby the sinnews is wounded or prickt, then shal you incontinently take vp the sinnew so wounded, searching the wound with great discretion, and cut it cleane insun∣der, then shal you endeuor to heale vp the same with vnguents, plaisters & balms, as shall be hereafter mentioned in the chapters of wounds and vlcers, of what kind or nature soe∣uer. Of the cold in the head. ACcording to the cold which the horsse hath taken, is new or old, great or small, and also according as humors do abound in his head, and as such humors be thicke or thin, Blundevile so is the disease more or lesse daungerous. For if the horsse casteth little or no matter out of his nose, nor hath no very great cough but onely heauy in his heade, and perhaps lightly cougheth now and then, it is a signe that he is stopped in the head, which we were wont to call the pose. But if his head be ful of humors congeald by some extream cold taken of long time past, and that he casteth fowle filthy matter out at the nose, and cougheth greeuously, then it is a signe that hee hath either the Glaunders, or the Stran∣gullion, mourning of the cheine, or consumption of the lungs. For all such diseases doe breed for the most part of the Rhueme or distillation that commeth from the head. Of the cures whereof we leaue to speake, vntill we come to talke of the diseases in the throat, minding heere to shew you how to heale the pose or colde before mentioned. Martin saith, it is good to purge his head, by perfuming him with Frankencence, and also to prouoke him to neeze by thrasting two Goose feathers dipt in oyle de Bay vp in∣to his nostrils and then to trot him vppe and downe halfe an houre, for these feathers will make him to cast immediatly at the nose. Laurentius Russius would haue him to be perfu∣med with Wheat, Penneroyal, and sage sodden well togither and put into a bag so hot as may be, which bagge would be so close fastened to his head, that all the sauour thereof may ascend vp into his nostrils, and his head also would be couered and kept warme: and to prouoke him to neeze, he would haue you to bind a soft clout annointed with sope, or els with Butter and oyle de Bay vnto a sticke, and to thrust that vp and downe into his no∣strils, so high as you may conueniently goe, and let him be kept warm and drink no cold water. Yea, it shal be good for three or foure daies, to boile in his water a little Fenegreek, wheate meale, and a few Annis seeds. And euerie daie after that you haue purged his head by perfuming him, or by making him to neeze, cause him to be trotted vp and downe, either in the warme Sunne, or els in the house halfe an hour, which would be done before you water him, and giue him his prouender. Of the cold in the head. T He pose or cold in a horsse, is the most generall disease that hapneth, and is the easiest perceiued, both by stopping, ratling in the nose, and cough∣ing, Markham. the cure thereof is in this sort: If it be but newly taken by some care∣lesse regard, and immediately perceiued, you shal need no other remedy but to keepe him warme euery Morning and Euening after his water, to ride him forth, and to trot him vp and downe very fast till his cold break, and then gently to gallop him a little, which moderate exercise with warme keeping will quickly recouer him againe; but if the cold hath had long residence in him, and still encreaseth, then you shall giue him this drinke three daies togither. Take of strong Ale one quart, of the best Treakle six penniworth, of long Pepper and graines, of each as much beaten to powder, of the iuice of Garlicke two spoonefuls, boile all these togither, and giue it the horsse to drinke, so warme as he may suffer it, and then trotte him vp and downe by the space of an houre or more, and keepe him warme, giuing him to drinke no cold water. Of the diseases of the eies. HOrsses eies be subiect to diuers griefes, as to be waterish or blood-shotten, Blundevile to bee dim of sight, to haue the pin and web, and the haw, whereof some comes of inward causes, as of humors resorting to the eies, and some of outward, as of cold, heate, or stripe. Of weeping or watering eies. This, as Laurentius Russius saith, may come sometime by confluence of humors, and sometime by some stripe, whose cure I leaue to recite, because it doeth not differ much from Martins experience heere following: take of Pitch, Rosen and Mastick, a like quantity, melt them togither. Then with a little sticke, hauing a clout bound to the end thereof, and dipt therein, annoint the Temple vaines on both sides, a hand ful aboue the eies, as broad as a Testern, and then clap vnto it immediately a few flockes of like co∣lour to the horsse, holding them close to his head with your hand, vntill they sticke fast vn∣to his head, then let him blood on both sides (if both sides be infected) a handfull vnder the eies. Russius also thinketh it good to wash his eies once a day with pure white wine, and then to blow therein a little of Tartarum, and of Pomis stone, beaten into fine pow∣der. Of watering eyes. WAtering eies commeth most commonly in some stripe or blowe, and the cure is thus. Lay vnto his Temples a plaister of Turpentine and Pitch molten together, Markham. then wash his eies with white Wine, and afterward blow the pouder of burnt Allome into the same. Of bloud-shotten eies, also for a blow, or itching and rubbing in the eies. Martin neuer vsed any other medicine, then this water heere following, wherewith he did alwaies heale the foresaid griefes: take of pure Rose water, of Malmesie, Blundevile of Fennel water, of each three sponfuls, of Tutia as much as you can easily take with your thumbe and finger, of cloues a dozen beaten into fine powder; mingle them toge∣ther, and being luke warme, or cold if you will, wash the inward part of the eie with a fea∣ther dipt therein twice a day vntill he be whole. Russius saith that to bloudshotten eies it is good to lay the white of an Egge, or to wash them with the iuice of Selidonye. Another of blood-shotten eies, or any other sore eie, comming of rume of other humor. FOr any sore eye make this water, take of the water of Eye-bright, of Rosewater, Markham. and Malmesey, of each three spoonefuls, of Cloues 6. or seauen beaten to fine powder, of the iuice of Houselicke two spoonefuls, mix all these togither and wash the horsses eies therewith once a day, and it will recouer him. Of dimnesse of sight, and also for the pin and web, or any other spot in the eie. I F the horsse be dim of sight, or hath any pearle growing in his eie, or thin film couering the ball of his eie, than Russius would haue you take of pomis stone of Tartarum, and of sal Gemma, of each like weight, Blundevile and being beaten into very fine powder to blow a little of that in his eie, continuing so to do euerie daie once or twice, vntill he be whole. Martin saith, that hee alwaies vsed to blow a little sandiuoire into the eie once a day, which simple he affirmeth to be of such force, as it will breake any pearle or web in short space, and make the eie very cleare and faire. Russius amongst a number of other medicines, praiseth most al the powder of a blacke flint stone. Of the Pin and Web, and other dimnesse. Markham. FOr to cure the Pinne, Web, Peatle, Fylme, or other dimnesse, vse this meanes follo∣wing: Take of Sandiuere, the powder of burnt Allom, and the powder of black Flint∣stone of each like quantity: and once a day blow a little thereof into the horsses eye, and it will weare away such imperfect matter, and make the eie cleere. Of the Haw, called of the Italians, Il vnghia de gli occhi. THis is a gristle couering sometime more then one halfe of the eie. It proceedeth of grosse and tough humours, Blundevile discending out of the heade, which Haw, as Martin saith, would be cut away in this sort. First pull both the eyelids open with two seue∣rall threds, stitched with a needle to either of the lids. Then catch holde of the Haw with another needle and thred, and pull it out so far as you may cutte it round the bredth of a penny, and leaue the blacke behind. For by cutting away too much of the fat and blacke of the eie, the horsse many times becommeth blear eied. And the haw being clean taken away, squirt a littie white wine or beere into his eie. Another of the Haw. A Haw is a grosse grissell growing vnder the eye of a horsse, and couering more then one halfe of his sight; Markham. which if he bee suffered will in short time perrish the eie: the cure is thus, Lay your thumbe vnder his eie, in the very hollow, then with your fin∣ger pull downe the lid, and with a sharpe needle and thred take hold of the haw, and pluc∣king it out, with a sharpe knife cut it away the compasse of a penny, or more, that done, wash the eie with a little Beere. Of Lunaticke eies. VEgetius writeth De oculo lunatico, but he sheweth neither cause nor signes thereof, but onely saith that the old men tearmed it so, Blundevile because it maketh the eie sometime to looke as though it were couered with white, and sometime cleare. Martin saith, that the horsse that hath this disease, is blind at certain times of the Moone, insomuch that he seeth almost nothing at all during that time, and then his eyes will look yellowish: yea, and somewhat reddish, which disease according to Martin, is to be cured in this sort. First vse the plaister mentioned before in the chapter of waterish or weeping eies, in such order as is there prescribed, and then with a sharpe knife make two slittes on both sides of his head an inch long, somewhat towardes the nose, a handfull beneath the eies, not touching the vaine: and with a cornet loosen the skinne vpward the breadth of a groat, and thrust therein a round peece of leather, as broad as a two penny peece, with a hole in the middest to keepe the whole open, and looke to it once a day, that the matter may not be stopped, but continually run the space of ten daies, then take the leather out, and heale the wound with a little flax dipt in the salue heere following: Take of Turpen∣tine, of hony, of wax, of each like quantity, and boile them togither, which being a little warmed, wil be liquid to serue your purpose, and take not away the plaisters from the tem¦ples vntil they fal away of themselues, which being fallen, then with a smal hot drawinge yron, make a starre in the midst of each Temple vaine where the plaister did lie. Which star would haue a hole in the middest made with the button end of your drawing yron. Another of lunaticke or moone eies. Markham. OF these Lunaticke eyes, I haue knowne diuers: they are blinde at certaine times of the Moone, they are very redde, fiery, and full of filme: they come with ouer-riding, and extraordinary heat and fury, the cure of them is thus: Lay vppon the Temples of his head a plaister of Pitch, Rozen, and Mastick molten togither very excee∣ding hot: then with a little round yron made for the purpose, burne three or foure holes an inch or more vnderneath his eies, and annoint those holes euery day with Hogges greace, then put it in his eies euery day with a little Hony, and in short time he wil reco∣uer his sight. Of the Canker in the eie. T His commeth of a ranke and corrupt blood discending from the head into the eie. The signes. You shall see red pimples, some small, and some great, both within and without vpon the eye-lids, and al the eye will looke redde, Blundevile and be full of corrupt matter. The cure according to Martin is thus. Firste, let him blood on that side the necke, that the eie is greeued, the quantity of a pottle. Then take of Rochalum, of greene Coporas of each half a pound, of white Co∣poras one ounce, and boile them in three pints of running water, vntill the halfe be con∣sumed, then take it from the fire, and once a day wash his eie with this water being made luke warme with a fine linnen cloath, and clense the eie therewith so oft as it may look raw, continuing thus to do euery day vntill it be whole. Of diseases incident to the eares, and poll of the head, and first of an Impostume in the eare. I Mpostumes breed either by reason of some blow or brusing, or els of euil humors congealed in the eare by some extream colde, the signes bee apparant, by the burning and painefull swelling of the eare and part thereabout. The cure according to Martin is in this sort. First, ripe the impostume with this plaister. Take of Lineseed beaten into powder, of wheat Flo∣wer, of each halfe a pint, of hony a pint, of Hogges greace or barrowes greace one pound. Warme al these thinges togither in an earthen pot, and stir them continuallie with a flat stick or slice, vntill they be thoroughly mingled and incorporated togither, and then spreade some of this plaister being warme vpon a peece of linnen cloath, or soft white leather, so broad as the swelling and no more, and lay it warme vnto it, and so let it remaine one wholeday, and then renewe it with fresh ointment, continuing so to doe vntill it breake, then lance the sore, so that it may haue passage downeward, and taint it to the bottome with a taint of flax dipt in this ointment: take of Mel Rosatum, of oyle oliue and turpen∣tine, of each two ounces, and mingle them togither, and make him a biggen of Canuas to close in the sore, so as the taint with the ointment may abide within, renewing the taint once a day, vntill it be whole. But if the horsse haue paine in his eares, without any great swelling or impostumation, then thrust in a litle blacke wooll dipt in oile of Camomile, and that will heale it. Of the Poll euill. T His is a disease like a Fistula growing betwixt the eares and the poll or nape of the necke, and proceedeth of euill humors gathered togither in that place, or els of some blow or bruse, for that is the weakest and tenderest part of all the head, and therefore soonest offended, which rude Carters do little consider whilst in their fury they beat their horsses vpon that place of the head with their whippe∣stocks, and therefore no horsse is more subiect to this disease then the cart horsse, and this disease commeth most in winter season. The signes. You shall perceiue it by the swelling of the place, which by continuance of time will breake it selfe, rotting more inward then outward, and therefore is more perilous if it be not cured in time, and the sooner it be ta∣ken in hand the b ter. The cure according to Martin is thus. If it be not broken, ripe it with a plaister of hogges greace laid vnto it so hot as may bee, and make a biggen for the Poll of his head to keepe it from colde, which biggen would haue two holes open, so as his eares may stande out, and renew the plaister euery day once vntill it breake, keeping the sore place as warme as may be. And if you see that it will not breake so soone as you woulde haue it, then there as it is softest and most meetest to be opened, take a round hot yron, as big as your little finger, and sharpe at the point, and two inches beneath that soft place, thrust it in a good deepe∣nesse vpwarde, so as the point of the yron may come out at the ripest place, to the intent that the matter may discend downeward, and come out at the neather hole, which would be alwaies kept open, and therefore taint it with a taint of Rax dipt in hogs greace, and lay a plaister of hogges greace also vpon the same, renewing it euery day once the space of foure daies, which is done cheefely to kill the heat of the fire. Then at the foure daies end, take of Turpentine halfe a pound, cleane washed in nine sundry waters, and after that throughly dried, by thrusting out the Water with a slice on the dishes side, then put thereunto two yolkes of Egges, and a little saffron, and mingle them well together: that done, search the depth of the hole with a whole quil, and make a taint of a peece of spunge, so long as it may reach the bottome, and so bigge as it may fill the wound, and annoint the taint with the aforesaide ointment, and thrust it into the wound, either with that quill, or else by winding it vp with your finger and thumbe, by li∣tle and little vntill you haue thrust it home: and then lay on the plaister of hogges greace made luke warme, renuing it euery day once or twice vntil it be whole. But if the swelling cease, then you need not to vse the plaister, but onely to taint it, and as the matter de∣creaseth, so make your taint euerie daye lesser and lesser, vntill the wounde bee perfectly whole. Of the Ʋiues. Blundevile THe Viues be certaine kirnels growing vnder the horsses eare, proceeding of some rancke or corrupt bloode resorting to the place, which within are ful of little white grains, like white salt kirnels. The Italians cal them Viuole, which if they bee suffered to grow, Laurentius Russius saith, that they will greeuously paine the horsse in his throat, so as he shal not be able to swallow his meat, nor to breth. They be easie to know, for they may be felt and also seene: The cure according vnto Martin, is in this sort: First drawe them right down in the midst with a hot yron, from the root of the ear so far as the tip of the eare wil reach, being puld down: and vnder the root againe draw two strikes on each side like a broad arrow head, then in the midst of the first line launce them with a launcet, and taking hold of the kirnels with a paire of pinsons, pul them so far forward, as you may cut the kirnels out without hurting the vaine; that done, fil the hole with white salte. But Hierocles would haue them to bee cured in this sort: take a peece of spunge sowsed wel in strong Vineger, and bind that to the sore, renewing it twice a day vntil it hath rotted the kirnels, that done, lance the neathermost part where the matter lieth, and let it out, and then fill it vp with salt finely braied, and the next day wash al the filth away with warm wa∣ter, and annoint the place with honie and fitch-flower mingled togither. But beware you touch none of the kirnels with your bare finger for feare of venoming the place, which is verie apt for a Fistula to breed in. Another of the Ʋiues. THe Viues be certaine kirnels, growing vnder the horsses eare, which come of cor∣rupt blood, Markham. the cure is diuersly spoke and written of, but this is the best mean which I haue tried: that if you finde the kernels to enflame and greeue the horsse, take a handful of Sorrel, and lap it in a Bur-docke leafe, and roast it in the hot embers like a war∣den, then being taken out of the fire, apply it so hot as may be to the fore-part, suffering it to lie thereunto the space of a day and a night, and then renew it, till such time that it ripen and break the sore, which it wil in short space do. When it is broken and the vilde matter taken away, you shal heale vp the sore place with the yolk of an Egge, halfe a spooneful of hony, and as much wheat-flower as wil serue to make it thicke, plaister-wise, which being bound thereunto, wil in three or foure daies heale the same. Of the Cankerous Vlcer in the nose. THis disease is a fretting humor, eating and consuming the flesh, Blundevile and making it al raw within, and not being holpen in time wil eat through the gristle of the nose. It com∣meth of corrupt blood, or else of sharp humors ingendered by meanes of some ex∣treame cold. The signes be these. He wil bleede at the nose, and al the flesh within wil be raw, and filthy stinking sauours, and matter wil come out at the nose. The cure according to Martin is thus. Take of green Coporas, of Allum, of each one pound, of white Copo∣ras one quarterne, and boile these in a pottle of running water, vntil a pint be consumed, then take it off, and put thereunto halfe a pinte of hony: then cause his head to be holden vp with a drinking staffe, & squirt into his nostrils with a squirt of brasse, or rather of Elder, some of this water being lukewarme, three or foure times one after another, but betwixt euery squirting▪ giue him liberty to hold downe his head, and to blow out the filthy mat∣ter, for otherwise perhaps you may choke him. And after this it shal be good also without holding vp his head any more, to wash and rub his Nostrils with a fine cloute bound to a white sticks end, and wet in the water aforesaid, and serue him thus once a day vntill he be whole. Of bleeding at the nose. I Haue seen Horsses my selfe, that haue bled at the nose, which haue had neither sore nor vlcer in their Nose, and therefore I cannot choose, but say with the Physitians, that it commeth by means that the vaine which endeth in that place, is either opened, broken or settered. It is opened many times by meanes that blood aboundeth too much, or for tha it is too fine, or too subtill, and so pierceth through the vaine. Againe it may be bro∣ by some violent strain, cut or blow. And finally, it may bee fretted or gnawn through, by the sharpnesse of the blood, or else of some other humor contained therein. As tou∣ching the cure, Martin saith, it is good to take a pinte of red Wine, and to put therein a quartern of Bole Armeny, beaten into fine powder, and being made lukewarm, to poure the one halfe therof the first day into his nostril that bleedeth, causing his head to bee hol∣den vp, so as the liquor may not fal out, and the next day to giue him the other halfe. But his preuaileth not, then I for my part would cause him to be let blood in the brest vaine, same side that he bleedeth at seueral times: then take of Frankencense one ounce, of Aloes halfe an ounce, and beate them into powder, and mingle them throughly with the whites of egges, vntil it be so thick as hony, and with soft Hares haire, thrust it vp into his nostrill, filling the hole so full, as it cannot fall out, or else fil his Nostrils ful of Asses dung, or Hogs dung, for either of them is excellent good to restraine any fluxe of blood. Of the bleeding at the nose, or to staunch Fluxe of blood in any sort. I Haue knowne many Horsses in great danger by bleeding, Markham. and I haue tryed diuers re∣medies for the fame, yet haue I not found any more certaine then this: take a spoone∣ful or two of his blood, and put it in a Sawcer, and set it vpon a chafingdish of coles, & et it boile til it be al dryed vp into powder, then take that powder, and if hee bleede at the e, with a Cane or quil blow the same vp into his Nostrils: if his bleeding come of any or other accident, then into the wounde put the same powder, which is a present edy. New Horse-dung or earth, is a present remedy, applyed to the bleeding place, are Sage leaues bruised and put into the wound. Blundevile Of the diseases in the mouth, and first of the bloudy rifts or chops in the palat of the mouth. THis disease is called of the Italians, Palatina, which as Laurentius Russius saith, com∣meth by eating hay or prouender that is full of pricking seedes, which by continual pricking & fretting the furrowes of the mouth do cause them to rankle, and to bleed corrupt and stinking matter, which you shal quickly remedy, as Martin saith, by washing first the sore places with vineger and salt, and then by annointing the same with hony. Of the bladders in a Horsses mouth, which our old Ferrers were wont to cal the Gigs. The Italians call them Froncelle. THese be litle soft swellings or rather pustuls with blacke heads, growing in the inside of his lips, next vnto the great iaw-teeth, which are so painful vnto the horse, as they make him to let his meat fal out of his mouth, or at the least to keepe it in his mouth vnchawed, whereby the horsse prospereth not. Russius saith, that they come either by eat∣ing too much cold grasse, or else pricking, dusty, and filthy prouender. The cure wherof, according to Martin, is in this sort. Slit them with a launcet, and thrust out all the corrup∣tion, and then wash the sore places with a little vineger and salt, or els with Alum water. Of the bladders in a Horse mouth. Markham. SOme Horsses will haue bladders like paps growing in the inside of their lips, next to their great teeth, which are much painful: the cure whereof is thus. Take a sharp paire of shears, and clip them away close to the gum, and then wash the sore place with run∣ning water, Allum and hony boiled together, til it he whole. Of the Lampasse. THe Lampasse, called of the Italians Lampascus, proceedeth of the aboundance of blood, resorting to the first furrow of the mouth, I meane that which is next vnto the vpper foreteeth, causing the said furrow to swell so high as the Horsses teeth, so as he cannot chew his meate, but is forced to let it fall out of his mouth. The remedy is to cut al the superfluous flesh away, with a crooked hot iron made of purpose, which eue∣ry Smith can do. Another of the Lampasse. THe Lampasse is a thick spungy flesh, growing ouer a horsses vpper teeth, hindering the coniunction of his chaps, arkham. in such sort that hee can hardly eat: the cure is as fol∣loweth. Cut all that naughty flesh away with a hot yron, and then rub the sore well with salt, which the most ignorant Smith can do sufficiently. Of the Canker in the mouth. THis disease as Martin saith, is a rawnesse of the mouth and tongue, which is full of blisters, lundevile so as he cannot eat his meate. Which proceedes of some vnnaturall heate, comming from the stomach. For the cure whereof, take of Allum halfe a pound, of Hony a quarter of a pinte, of columbine leaues, of Sage leaues of each a handfull: boile al these together in three pints of water, vntill a pinte be consumed, and wash the sore places therewith so as it may bleede, continuing so to do euery day once vntill it be whole. Another of the Canker in the mouth. THis disease proceedeth of diuers causes, as of vnnaturall heat of the stomach, of foule feeding, Markham. or of the rust or vennome of some bit or snaffell, vndiscretly lookt vnto: the cure is thus. Wash the sore place with strong vineger, made thick with the powder of Al∣lum, two or three daies together, euery time vntil it bleede, which will kill the poyson and vigor of the exulcerated matter: then make this water, take of running water a quart, of Allum foure ounces, of Hony foure or fiue spoonefuls, of Wood-bineleaues, of Sage-leaues, and of Collombine-leaues, of each halfe a handful, boile al these together til one halfe be consumed, then take it off, and euery day with the water warmed, wash the sore vntil it be whole. Of the heat in the mouth and lips. SOmetime the heat that commeth out of the stomach breedeth no Canker, but maketh the mouth hot, and causeth the horse to forsake his meat. The cure wherof, Blundevile as Martin saith, is in this sort. First, turne vp his vpperlip, and iagge it lightly with a launcet, so as it may bleede, and then wash both that and al his mouth and tongue with Vineger and salt. Of the tongue being hurt with the bit or otherwise. IF the tongue be cut or hurt any manner of way, Martin saith, it is good first to wash it with Allum water, and then to take the leaues of black Bramble and to chop them togi∣ther small with a little lard, that done to binde it vp in a little clout, making it round like a ball, then hauing dipt the round end in hony, rub the tongue therewith: continuing so to do once a day vntil it be whole. Of the Barbles, or Paps vnderneath the tongue. THese be two little paps, called of the Italians Barbole, growing naturally (as I thinke) in euery Horsses mouth vnderneath the tongue, in the neather iawes, which if they shoot of any length, Russius saith, that they wil hinder the Horsses feeding, and therefore he and Martin also would haue them to be clipt away with a paire of sheeres, and that don, the Horsses mouth to be washed with vineger and salt. Of the paine in the teeth and gums, of the Wolfes teeth, and Iaw-teeth. A Horse may haue paine in his teeth, partly by discent of humors from his head, down into his teeth and gums, which is to be perceiued by the ranknesse and swelling of the gums, and partly hauing two extraordinary teeth called the wolfes teeth, which be two little teeth growing in the vpper iawes, next vnto the great grinding teeth, which are so paineful to the Horse, as he cannot endure to chaw his meat, but is forced either to let it fal out of his mouth, or else to keepe it stil halfe chawed, whereby the Horse prospe∣reth not, but waxerh leane and poore, and he wil do the like also when his vpper Iaw-teeth be so far growne as they ouerhang the neather Iaw-teeth, and therewith be so sharp, as in mouing his iawes they cut and race the insides of his cheeks, euen as they were raced with a knife. And first as touching the cure of the paine in the teeth, that commeth by meanes of some distillation: Vegetius saith, it is good to rub al the outside of his gums with fine chalke and strong vineger mingled together, or else after that you haue washed the gums with vineger, to strew on them of Pomegranate piles. But methinkes that besides this, it were not amisse to stop the temple vains, with the plaister before mentioned, in the chap∣ter of weeping and waterish eies. The cure of the Wolfes teeth, and of the iaw-teeth ac∣cording to Martin is in this sort. First cause the horsse head to be tyed vp to some rafter or post, and his mouth to be opened with a cord, so wide as you may easily see euery part thereof. Then take a round strong iron toole, half a yard long, and made at the one end in al points like vnto the Carpenters gouge, wherewith he maketh his holes to be bored with a wimble or augor, & with your left hand set the edge of your toole at the foot of the wolfs teeth, on the outside of the iaw, turning the hollow side of the toole downward, holding your hand steadily, so as the toole may not slip from the foresaid tooth: then hauing a mallet in your right hand strike vpon the head of the toole one pretty blow, and therwith you shal loosen the tooth, and cause it to bend inward: then staying the midst of your toole vpon the hor∣ses neather iaw, wrinch the tooth outward, with the inside or hollow side of the toole, and thrust it clean out of his head: Blundevile that done, serue the other Wolfes tooth on the other side in like manner, and fill vp the empty places with salt finely braied. But if the vpper iawe-teeth do also ouerhang the neather teeth, & so cut the inside of his mouth as is aforesaid, then keeping his mouth stil open, take your toole and mallet, and pare al those teeth shor∣ter, running alongst them euen from the first vnto the last, turning the hollow side of your toole towards the teeth so shal not the toole cut the inside of his cheekes, and the backe or round side being turned toward the foresaid checkes, and that doone wash all his mouth with vineger and salt, and let him go. Why the diseases in the necke, withers, and backe, be declared heere before the diseases in the throate. HAuing hitherto spoken of the diseases incident to a horsses head, and to al the parts thereof, natural order requireth that we shold now discend into the throat, as a part next adiacent to the mouth. But forasmuch as the diseases in the throate haue not onely afinity with the head, but also with the lungs and other inward parts, which are ma∣ny times grieued by meanes of distillation comming from the head, and through the throat: I wil speake of the diseases, incident to the necke, withers, and backe of a Horsse, to the intent that when I come to talke of such diseases, as rheumes and distillations doe cause, I may discourse of them orderly without interruption. Of the Cricke in the necke. BEcause a Cricke is no other thing but a kind of conuulsion, and for that we haue spo∣ken sufficiently bofore of al kinds thereof in the chapter of conuulsion: I purpose not heere therefore to trouble you with many wordes, but onely shewe you Russius opinion, and also Martins experience therein. The cricke then called of the Italians Scima or Luter∣do according to Russius, and according to Martin is, when the Horsse cannot turne his neck any maner of way, but hold it stil right forth, insomuch as he cannot take his meate from the ground but by times, and that very slowly, Russius saith it commeth by meanes of some great weight laid on the horsses shoulders, or else by ouermuch drying vp of the sinnewes of the necke. The cure whereof according to Martin is in his sort. Draw him with a hot iron from the root of the eare on both sides of the necke, through the midst of the same euen down to the breast, a straw deep, so as both ends may meet vpon the breast: then make a hole in his forehead, hard vnder the fore-top, and thrust in a cornet vpwarde betwixt the skin and the flesh a handfull deepe, then put in a Goose feather, doubled in the midst and annointed with Hogs-greace to keepe the hole open, to the intent the matter may run out the space of ten daies. But euery day during that time, the hole must be clen∣sed once, and the feather also clensed and fresh annointed, and so put in again. And once a day let him stand vpon the bit one houre or two, or be ridden two or three miles abroad by such a one as wil beare his head, and make him to bring it in. But if the Cricke be such as the Horsse cannot holde his necke straite, but cleane awry, as I haue seene diuers my selfe: then I thinke it not good that the Horsse be drawne with a hot iron on both sides of the necke, but onely on the contrary side. As for example, if he bend his head toward the right side, then to draw him as is a foresaid onely on the lefte side, and to vse the rest of the cure as is aboue saide, and if neede bee you may splent him also with handsome staues meete for the purpose to make his necke stand right. Of Wennes in the neck. A Wen is a certaine kirnell like a tumor of swelling, the inside whereof his hard like a gristle, and spongious like a skin ful of wrets. Of Wens, some be great, and some be small. Againe, some be very painefull, and some not paineful at all. The Physitians say, that they proceede of grosse and vicious humors, but Vegetius saith that they chance to a Horsse by taking cold, or by drinking of waters that be extreame cold. The cure ac∣cording to Martin is thus: take of Mallowes, Sage, and red nettles, of each one handful, boile them in running water, and put therunto a litle butter, and hony, and when the herbs be soft, take them out and all to bruise them, and put thereunto of oile of Bay two ounces, and two ounces of Hogs-greace, and warme them together ouer the fire, mingling them well together; that done, plaister it vpon a piece of leather so big as the Wen, and lay it to so hot as the Horse may endure it, renewing it euery day in such sort, the space of eight daies, and if you perceiue that it will come to no head, then lance it from the midst of the Wen downward, so deep as the matter in the bottom may be discouered and let out, that doone, heale it vp with this salue: take of Turpentine a quarter, and wash it nine times in faire new water, then put thereunto the yolk of an egge, and a little English Saffron bea∣ten into powder, and make a taint or rowle of Flax, and dip it in that ointment, and lay it vnto the sore, renewing the same euery day once vntil it be whole. Of swelling in the necke after bloodletting. THis may come of the fleame being rusty, and so causing the vaine to rankle, or else by meanes of some cold wind striking suddainely into the hole. The cure according to Martin is thus. First annoint it with oyle of Camomell warmed, and then lay vpon it a lit∣tle hay wet in cold water, and bind it about it with a cloth, renewing it euery day the space of fiue daies, to see whether it wil grow to a head, or else vanish away. If it grow to a head, then giue it a slit with a lancet, and open it with a Cornet that the matter may come out. Then heale it vp, by tainting it with Flax dipt in Turpentin and Hogs-greace molten to∣gether, dressing it so once a day vntil it be whole. How to staunch blood. IF a Horsse be let blood when the signe is in the necke, the vaine perhaps will not leaue bleeding so soone as a man would haue it, which if any such thing chance, then Russius saith, it is good to binde thereunto a little new Horse dung tempered with chalke and strong vineger, and not to remooue it from thence the space of three daies, or else to lay thereunto burnt silke, felt, or cloath, for al such things wil staunch blood. Of the falling of the Crest. THis commeth for the most part of pouerty, Blundevile and specially when a fat Horse falleth a∣way sodainely. The cure according to Martin is thus. Draw his Crest the deepnes a straw, on the contrary side with a hot iron, the edge of which iron would be halfe an inch broad, and make your beginning and ending somewhat beyond the fall, so as the first draught may go all the way hard vppon the edge of the mane, euen vnderneath the rootes of the same, bearing your hand right downward, into the neckeward, then answer that with another draught beneath, & so far distant from the first as the fal is broad, com∣passing as it were al the fall, but stil on the contrary side: and betwixt those two draughts right in the midst, draw a third draught, then with a button iron of an inch about, burne at each end a hole, and also in the space betwixt the draughts, make diuers holes distant three fingers broade one from another: that done, to slake the fire annoint it euery day once, for the space of nine daies with a feather dipt in fresh butter moulten. Then take Mallowes and Sage, of each one a handfull, boile them well in running water, and wash the burning away vntill it be raw flesh, then dry it vp with this powder. Take of hony halfe a pinte, and so much vnslect lime as wil make that hony thicke like paast: then hold it in a fire-pan ouer the fire vntil it be baked so hard as it may be made in powder, and sprinkle that vpon the sore places. Of the falling of the Crest. T He falling of the Crest is occasioned most commonly through pouerty: yet somtimes I haue seen it chance through the il proportion of the crest, Markham. which being hye, thicke and heauy, the necke thin and weake vnderneath, is not able to support or sustaine it vp, how euer it be there is remedy for both: if it proceede of pouerty, first try by good keeping to get it vp a∣gaine, but if it wil not rise, or that the originall of the disease be in the il fashion of the crest, then let this be the cure: First with your hand raise vp the Crest as you would haue it stand, or rather more to that side from which it declineth, then take vp the skin betweene your fingers on that side from which the Crest swarueth, and with a sharpe knife cut away the breadth of very neere an inch, and the length of foure inches, which doone stitche vp the skinne together againe with three or foure stitches, and by meanes of strings, weights, or other deuises, keepe the crest perforce leaning on that side, applying thereunto a plai∣ster of Deeres sewet and Turpentine, boiled together, till the sore bee healed: and at the selfe same instant that by this maner of insition you draw together and straiten the skin on that side, you shal in this sort giue liberty to the other side, wherby the crest may the easier attaine to his place: Take a hot yron made in fashion of a knife, the edge being a quarter of an inch broad, and therewith from the vpper part of his crest vnto the neather part of the same extending towardes his shoulder, draw three lines in this forme, | | | and the same anoint daily with fresh butter, vntil such time as it be perfectly whole. | | | By this manner of cure, you may make any laue-eard Horsse, to be as pricke eard | | | & com∣ly, as any other Horse whatsoeuer. Of the manginesse of the maine. T He manginesse proceedeth of rankenesse of blood, or of pouerty, of lowsines, or else of rubbing where a mangy Horsse hath rubbed, Blundevile or of filthy dust lying in the mane for lacke of good dressing. The signes be apparant by the itching and rubbing of the Horsse, and the scabbes, fretting both flesh and skin. The cure according to Martin, is thus: take of fresh grease one pound, of quicksiluer halfe an ounce, of Brimstone one ounce, of rape oyle halfe a pint, mingle them together, and stir them continually in a pot with a slice, vntill the quicksiluer be so wrought with the rest, as you shall perceiue no quicksiluer therein. That done, take a blunt knife, or an old Horsse∣combe, and scratch all the mangy places therewith vntill it bee raw and bloody, and then annoint it with this ointment, in the sunshine if it may be, to the intent the ointment may sinke in: or else hold before it a fire pan or some broad bar of iron made hot, to make the ointment to melt into the flesh And if you see that within the space of three dayes after, with this once annointing, he leaue not rubbing, then marke in what place he rubbeth, and dresse that place againe, and you shall see it heale quickly. Of the falling of the haire of the mane. IT falleth for the most part, because it is eaten with little Wormes, fretting the rootes in sunder, which according to Martin you shall remedy in this sort. Annoint the mane and Crest with sope, then make stronglie and wash all the mane and Crest withall, and that wil kill the wormes, within twice or thrice washing. Of griefes in the withers. T O a horsses withers and backe, do chance many griefes and sorances, which as Russius saith, do sometime proceed of inward causes, as of the corrup∣tion of humors, and sometime of outward causes, as through the galing and pinching of some naughty saddle, or by some heauy burthen laide on the horsses-backe or such like. And of such griefes some be but superficiall blisters, swellings, light gals or brusings: and be easily cured. Some againe do pierce to the very bone, and be dangerous, and especially if they bee nigh the backe bone; let vs first then shew you the cure of the smaller griefes, and then of the greater. Another of blistrings, or small swellings in the withers or backe and gallings. W Hensoeuer you see any swelling rise, then Martin woulde haue you to bind a litle hot horse dung vnto it, and that will asswage it. If not, Blundevile then to pricke it round about the swelling, either with a fleame, or els with a sharpe pointed knife not too deepe, but so as it may pierce the skin, and make the blood to issue forth. That done, take of Mallowes or else of smallage, two or three handfuls, and boile them in running Water vntill they be so soft as pap: Then straine the water from it, and bruse the hearbs in a trean dish, putting thereunto a little Hogges greace or els sallet oile, or sheepes sewet, or any other fresh greace, boile them and stir them togither, not frying them hard, but so as it may be soft and supple, and then with a clout laie it warme vpon the sore, renewing it e∣uerie daie once vntill the swelling be gone. For this will either driue it awaie, or els bring it into his heade, which lightlie chaunceth not, vnlesse there bee some gristle or boane perished. Russius biddeth you, so soone as you see any swilling rise, to shaue the place with a ra∣sor and lay thereunto this plaister: take a little wheat flower and the white of an egge bea∣ten togither, and spreade it on a little clout, which beeing laide vnto the swelling two or three daies and not remoued, wil bring it to a heade, and when you come to take it off, pull it away so softly as you can possible, and whereas you see the corruption gathred to∣gither, then in the lowest place thereof, pierce it vpwarde with a sharpe yron somewhat hot, that the corruption may come out, and annoint the sore place euerie day once with fresh butter, or Hogges greace, but if the skinne be onely chafed off, without anie swel∣ling, then wash the place with water and salt, or els with warme Wine, and springle this pouder thereon: take of vnsleact lime beaten into fine pouder, and mingle it with honie vntil it be as thicke as any paast, and make rolles or bals thereof, and bake them in a fire-pan ouer the fire, vntil they be so hard as they may be brought to pouder, for this is a ve∣rie good pouder to drie vp anie galling or sore. The pouder of Mirre or burnt silke, fealt, or cloath, or anie olde post, is also good for such purposes, but whensoeuer you vse this pouder of lime and honie, let the place be washed, as is aforesaide. Of great swellings and inflammations in a Horsses withers. IF the swelling be verie great, then the cure according to Martin is thus. First drawe round about the swelling with a hotte Iron, and then crosse him with the same yron in maner of a checker, then take a rounde hot yron hauing a sharpe point, and thruste it into the swelling place on each side vp toward the point of the withers; to the intent the matter may issue downward at the holes. That done, taint both the holes with a taint dipt in hogges greace to kil the fire, and also annoint al the oth r burnt places therewith, continuing so to doe vntil the swelling be asswaged, renewing it euery day once, vntil the fiery matter be clean fallen away, and then taint him againe with washed Turpentine mingled with yolkes of Egges and Saffron in such manner as hath beene aforesaide, renewing the taint euerie day once vntill it bee whole. If you see that the swelling for all this goe not away, then it is a signe of some impostu∣mation within, and therefore it shal be necessary to lance it, and to let out the corruption; then take of Hony halfe a pinte, of Verdigrease two ounces beaten to powder, and min∣gle it together with the Hony, then boyle them in a pot vntill it looke red, then being luk∣warme, make either a taint or plaister, according as the wound shal require, renewing the same euery day once, vntil it be whole. But the sore may be so vehement, that for lacke of looking in time, it will pierce downeward betwixt both shoulders toward the intrailes, which is very daungerous: yea, and as Russius saith, mortall, because the corruption of the sore infecting the lungs and h rt (which be the vitall partes and chiefe preservers of life) the body must needs decay. And therefore Martin would haue you to fil the hole with the salue last mentioned, and to thrust in afterwarde a peece of a spunge, as well to keepe the hole open, as also to sucke out the corruption, renewing it euery day once, vntill it be whole. Of the hornes or hard knobs growing vnder the saddle side. THis is a dead skin like a peece of leather, called of the Itallans Corno, that is to say, a horne, for that it is hard vnder hand, and commeth by meanes of some straight sad∣dle, pinching the horsse more on the one side than on the other: or els on both sides equally. Blundevile The cure whereof according to Martin, is in this sort: Annoint them with fresh butter or Hogges greace, vntil they be mollified and made so soft as you may either cut-them, or pull them away, and then wash the wound with mans stale, or with white wine, and dry it with powder of vnsleact lime mixt with hony. Of Wennes or knobs growing about the saddle skirts. THese be great harde knobs growing most commonly betwixt two ribs, apparant to the eie, which by their hardnesse seeme to come of some old bruse, and are called of Italians le Curf. The cure whereof, according to Martin is thus. First mollifie them, by annointing them with Hogges greace euery day once or twice, the space of eight daies, and if you perceiue that it will come to no head with this, then lance it from the middle downeward, that the matter may come out: then taint it with washed Turpentine, yolkes of Egges, and safforon mingled togyther as is aforesaid, renewing the taint euery daye once vntill it be whole. Of the Nauill gall. THe Nauill gal is a bruse on the backe behind the saddle right against the Nauill of the horsse, and thereof taketh his name. It commeth either by splitting of the saddle be∣hind, or for lacke of stuffing, or by meanes of the hinder buckle fretting that place, or else by some great weight laid on his backe: you shal perceiue it by the puffed vppe, and spungy flesh, looking like rotten lightes or lunges, and therefore is called of the Italians Pulmone, or Pulmoncello. The cure whereof according to Martin, is thus. Cut it rounda∣bout with a sharpe knife or rasor euen to the bone, leauing no rotten flesh behinde: that done, take the white of an Egge and salt beaten togither, and lay that plaister wise to the sore vpon a little towe, renewing it once a day the space of two daies. Then take of hony a quarterne of a pint, and of Verdigrease an ounce beat into powder, and boile them to∣gither in a pot, stirring it still vntil it looke redde, and being luke warme, make a plaister with to e and clap it to the wound, washing and clensing well the wound first with a little warme Vineger or white wine, continuing it once a day, vntill it begin to heale and skin, then dry it vp, by sprinkling thereon this pouder following. Take of hony a quarterne, and as much of vnslect lime as will thicken the hony like vnto paast, and in a fire pan ouer the fi e, stir it stil vntil it be hard baked, so as it may bee beaten into pouder, but before you throw on the powder, wash the wound first with warme Vineger, continuing so to do vntill it be perfectly skinned and whole. Of the swaying of the backe. THis is called of the Italians, Malferuto, Blundevile and according to Russius and Martins opi∣nions, commeth either by some great straine, or else by heauy burthens: you shal perceiue it by the reeling and roling of the horsses hinder parts in his going, which will falter many times, and sway sometimes backward, and sometime sideling, and be rea∣dy to fall euen to the ground, and the horsse being laide, is scant able to get vp. The cure according to Martin is thus. Couer his backe with a sheeps skin, comming hot from the sheepes backe, laying the fleshy side next vnto his backe, and lay a howsing cloath vpon the same to keepe his backe as warme as may be, and so let it continue, vntil it beginne to smel: then take the old skin away, and lay a new vnto it, continuing so to do the space of three weekes. And if he amend not with this, then draw his backe with a hot yron out on both sides of the ridge of his backe, from the Pitch of the Buttockes, vnto a handful with∣in the saddle, and let euery line be an inch distant one from another, and then againe o∣uerthwart checker-wise, but let not such stroks be very deep, and so burned as euery one looke yellow, then lay on this charge following. Take pitch one pound, of Rozen halfe a pound, of bole Armony halfe a pound made in powder, and halfe a pinte of Tarre, and boile all these togither in a pot, stirring it vntill euery thing bee molten and thoroughlie mingled togither, then being luke warme, dawbe al the burning therewith very thicke, and thereupon clap as many flockes of the horsses colour, as you can make to abide on, and remoue it not before it falaway it selfe, an if it be in Summer, you may turne him to grasse. Of the weakenesse in the backe. IT doth appeare by Laurentius Russius, that there is an other kind of weakenesse in the backe, called in Italian le gotte, or morsecatura de le reni, that is to say, the fretting or bi∣ting of the reines, which as the said Russius saith, proceedeth of abundance of humors, resorting to that place, whereby all the hinder partes of the horse doe leese their feeling and strength, and the horsse falleth downe on the ground: yea, and such humors resor∣ting to the hart, do suffocate the same, and in two or three houres do cause the horsse to die. The remedie according to Russius, is in this sort: Let him blood abundantlie in the necke, and draw his backe with a hot yron, in such sort as is declared in the last Chapter. He saith also it is good to make him swim through a riuer, and to rowell him on his han∣ches, nigh the huckle bones; and to make the haire to grow againe, it is good as he saith to aynoint the place with hogges greace, and three leaued grasse stamped together. Of Hydebound. HIdebound, is when the skinne cleaueth so fast to the horsses backe, that a man can∣not pul it from the flesh with his hand, which Ruellius calleth Coriago : it commeth meth for the most part of pouertie, or els when the horsse after some great heate hath beene suffered to stand long in the raine or wet weather, for that wil cause the skinne to shrinke, and to cling to his ribs. It is knowne by the leannesse of the horsse, and gantnes of his bely, and by fast sticking of the skin vnto the ribs when you pul at it with your hand. The cure according to Martin is thus. Let him blood on both sides the bellie in the flanke vaines betwixt the flanke and the girding place: that done, giue him this drinke. Take a quart of white Wine, or els of good Ale, and put thereunto three ounces of good sallet oyle, of Cummin one ounce, of Annis seedes two ounces, of Licoras two ounces, bea∣ten al into fine powder, and giue it him luke warme with a horne. And when he hath drunk let one standing at his huckle-bone, rub him hard with his hand along the back, and ouer∣thwart the ribbes the space of halfe an houre: that done, set him in a warme stable, and let him stand in litter vp to the belly, and couer all his backe and ribs with a sacke first tho∣roughly soked in a tub of cold water, and then well and hard wroung, and ouer that caste another cloath, and girde it fast with a surcingle, stuffing him well about the backe with fresh straw, continuing thus to doe euery day once the space of a weeke, during which time giue him no cold water but luke warme, and put therein a little ground mault. The wet sacke wil cause the backe to gather heat it selfe, and the skin to loosen from the flesh, and if you will bestow more cost, you may annoint all his body with wine and oile min∣gled togither, according to the opinion of the old writers, which no doubt is a very com∣fortable thing, and must needs supple the skinne, and loosen it from the flesh. Of the diseases in the throat and lungs, and why the griefes of the shoulders and hippes be not mentioned before amongst the griefes of the withers and backe. Blundevile SOme perhaps would looke heere, that for so much as I haue declared the diseases of the necke, withers and backe, that I should also follow on now with the griefes of the shoulders and hips. But sith that svch griefes for the most part doth cause a horse to halt, and that it requireth some skill to know when a horse halteth, whether the fault be in his shoulder, hip, legge, ioynt, or foot, I thinke it is not good to seperate those parts assun∣der, specially sith nature hath ioyned them togither, that is to say, the shoulders to the forelegs, and the hips to the hinder legges. And therefore according to natures order, I will treate of them in their proper place: that is to say, after that I haue shewed al the di∣seases that be in the inward horses body, not onely aboue the midriffe, as the diseases of the throat, lungs, breast, and hart, but also vnder the midriffe, as those of the stomacke, liuer, guts, and of all the rest And first, as touching the diseases of the throat, the Glaun∣ders, and Strangullion, to al horses is most common. Of the Glanders and Strangulion, so called according to the Italian name, Strangui lion. MOst Ferrers do take the Glanders and Strangullion to bee all one disease, but it is not so, for the glanders is that which the Physitians call Tronsillae, and the Stran∣gullion is that which they call in Latine Angina, in Greeke Synanchi, and we com∣monly call it in English, the squinnancy, or Qunzie. Tronsillae, is interpreted by them to be inflammations of the kirnels, called in Latine Glandes the Italian Glandulae, which lie on both sides of the throat, vnderneath the roote of the toongue, nigh vnto the swallowing place, of which word Gland , or Gl ndulae, I thinke we borrow this name glanders. For when the horse is troubled with this disease, hee hath great kirnels vnderneath his iawes, easie to be seene or felt, paining him so, as he can not easily swallow down his meat, which commeth first of cold distilation out of the head: But if such kirnels be not inflamed, they will perhaps goe away of themselues, or else by laying a little hot horse-dung and strawe vnto them, the warmth thereof wil dissolue them, and make them to vanish away. But if they be inflamed, they will not go away but encrease and wax greater and greater, and be more painful euery daie then other, and cause the horsse to cast continually filthie matter at his nose: The cure whereof according to Martin is thus: First ripe the kirnels with this plaister. Take of bran two handfuls, or as much as will thicken a quart of wine or Ale: then put thereunto halfe a pounde of hogges greace, and boile them togither, and lay it hot to the sore with a cloath, renewing it euery day vntil it be ready to breake, then lance it, and let out al the matter, and taint it with a taint of flax dipt in this salue: Take of Turpentine, of hogs greace, of each like quantity, and a little waxe, and melt them togi∣ther, and renew the taint euerie daie vntil it be whole. Laurentius Russius saith, that this di∣sease is verie common to colts, because in them doth abound flexible moisture, apt to be dissolued with euerie little heat, and to turne to putrifaction: and therefore if the horse be not ouer young, he would haue you first to let him bloode in the necke vaine, and then to lay vnto the same sore a ripening playster, made of Mallowes, Linseeds, Rew, Worm∣wood, ground Iuy, Oile of Baies, add Dialthea, and to annoint his throat also, and all the sore place with fresh butter: and the sore being ripe, to lance it, or els to rowel it, that the matter may come forth. But the kernels wil not decrease, then pul them away by the rootes, and to dry vp the vlcerous place with an ointment made of vnslect lime, Pepper, Brimstone, Nitrum, and oile Oliue. It shall be also good to purge his head by perfuming him euery day once, in such sort as hath beene before declared. And let the horsse be kept warm about the head and stand in a warme stable, and let him drinke no cold water: but if you see that after you haue taken away the kirnels, the horsse doth not for all that leaue casting filthy matter at the nose, then it is to be feared, that hee hath some spice of the mourning of the Chine, for both diseases proceed of one cause, and therefore I thinke good to speake of it heere presently. But first I will set downe a drinke which I haue seene prooued vppon a horse that I thought could neuer haue bin recouered of the same disease, and yet it did recouer him in very short space, so as he trauelled immediately after many miles, without the helpe of any other medicine. A drinke for the Strangullion or Glaunders. T Ake of warm milk as it commeth from the Cow a quart, or instead there∣of a quart of new Beere or Ale warmed, and put thereunto of moulten Butter the quantity of an Egge: and then take one head of Garlicke, Blundevile first clean pilled and then stamped smal, which you must put into the milke or drinke being made luke warme, and giue it the horse with a horne, and immediately after the drinke be giuen, catch hold of his tongue with your hand, and ha∣uing broken two raw Egges either vpon his foreteeth, or against the staffe wherewith his head is holden vp, cast those broken Egges, shels and all into his throat, making him to swallow downe the same, that doone, ride him vp and downe till he beginne to sweate, then set him vp couered warme with an old couerlet and straw, not suffering him to eate nor drinke for the space of two or three houres after, and let his drinke for the space of two or three daies, bee somewhat warme, whereinto it is good to put a handfull or two of bran or ground malt, and in giuing the said drinke, it shall not be amisse to poure some thereof into either nostrill. Of the mourning of the Chine. T His word mourning of the Chine, is a corrupt name borrowed of the French toong, wherein it is cald Mote deschien, that is to say, the death of the backe. Because many do hold this opinion that this disease doth consume the mar∣row of the backe: for remedy whereof, they vse strange kinds of cures. For some taking it to be a rheume, go about to stop it, by laying a strictiue, or binding char∣ges to the nape of the necke. Some againe, do twine out the pith of the backe with a long wire thrust vp into the horsses head, and so into his necke and backe, with what reason I know not. Well, I know that few horsses do recouer that haue this disease. Some againe thinke that the lungs of the horse be rotten, and that the horse doth cast them out at his nose. But Martin saith, that he hath cut vp diuers horsses which haue been iudged to haue dyed of the mourning of the chine, but he could find neuer either back or lungs to be pe∣rished, but onely the liuer, and most commonly that side of the liuer, which answeareth the nostrill whereat he casteth, whereof we will talke in his proper place, when we come to speake of the diseases in the Liuer. The Italians do call this disease Ciamorro, the olde Authors do cal it the moist malady, whereof Theomnestus maketh two differences. For in the one the matter which he doth cast at the nose is white, and doeth not smell at all: and in the other, that which he casteth is filthy and sticking corruption. They proceed both of cold humors congealed in the head, but more abounding in the one then in the other; by reason perhaps that the horsse was not cured in time: for of colde first commeth the Pose, and the cough, then the Glanders, and last of all the mourning of the chine. When the horse casteth matter at the nose that is not stinking, he may easily be cured by such re∣medyes as haue beene before declared in the chapter of the Pose: but if the matter be ve∣ry filthy and stincking, then it is very harde to cure. Notwithstanding, it shall not grieue me to write vnto you heere, the experience of Theomnestus, and of Laurentius Russius. Theomnestus cure is thus. Take of Water and hony called of the Physitians Hydromel, a quart, and put thereunto three ounces of oyle, and powre that into his nostrill euerye morning the space of three daies: and if that do not profit him, then let him drinke eue∣ry day, or once in two daies, a quart of olde wine, mingled with some of the medicine or rather the precious meate, called of the olde writers Tetraphramacum, and that will re∣store him to his former estate. Laurentius Russius saith, that of al diseases ther is non more perillous, nor more to be suspected, th n the rheume which commeth of cold, for hor∣ses haue large Conduites, and are full of moisture, and therefore if colde once enter, it findeth matter inough to worke on, to breede continuall distillation, as well outwardly at the nose, as inwardly, descending downe to the vitall part in such sort, as it doth not suffocat the same. The signes according to the said Russius be these, the horse doth cast matter continu∣ally at the nos , sometime thinne and sometime thicke, his nostrils, eares, and al his out∣ward parts, wil be cold to the feeling, his eyes, head, and all his body heauy, and he will cough, and haue smal appetite to his meat, and lesse to his drinke, and sometime he will tremble and shake: his cure is in this sort. Purge his head, partly by perfuming him, and partly by making him to neeze in such sort, as hath beene before taught in the chapter of the pose, which waies of perfuming and purging his head as they bee good, so doeth Russius praise these two heere following to be most excellent: the first is this: Take of the stalkes of Vitis alba otherwise called Brioni, or wilde Vine, two or three good hand∣fuls, and being brused, put them into a linnen bagge, and fasten the bagge to the hor∣ses head, so as he may receiue the scent vp into his nostrils, without touching the hearb wi h his mouth, and this will cause the humors to run downe aboundantly. The second medicine; Take of Euforbium beaten into fine powder, three ounces, of the iuice of Betes one pound, of Swines blood halfe a pound, boile al these togither vntil they bee thr ughly mingled togither, and liquide like an ointment, and then take it from the fire and put thereunto one ounce more of Euforbium and mingle them againe thoroughly togither, and preserue the same in a box, to vse at needefull times in this sort: Make two stiffe long rowles or tampins of linnen clowtes, or such like stuffe, sharpe pointed like su∣ger-loues: which tampins are called of the physitians in Latine Pessi, and being annoin∣ted with the ointment aforesaid, thrust them vp into the horsses nostrils, and let them a∣bide therein a pretty whilk, then pul them out, and you shal see such abundance of mat∣ter me forth at his nose, as is marueilous to behold: Russius also praiseth verye much this medicine heere following. Take as much of the middle barke of an Elder tree, growing on the water side, as will fil a new earthen pot of a meane size, putting thereunto as much cleere water as a pot wll hold, and let it boile vntil one halfe be consumed: and then to be filled vppe againe with fresh water, continuing so to doe three times one after another, and at the last time that the one halfe is consumed, take it from the fire, and straine it throgh a linnen cloth. Then take two partes of that decoction, and one part of hogges greace, or Butter, and being warmed againe togither, giue the horsse to drinke thereof one horneful, and poure ano∣ther hornefull into his nostril that casteth, and whensoeuer you giue him this medicine, let the horse bee empty and fasting, and keepe him without meat also two or three hours after, for this is a very good drinke for anye sicknesse that commeth of cold. Moreouer, open the skinne of his foreheade, and of his temples, and also of his taile with a sharpe hot yron, that the corrupt humours may yssue outward. That done, take hot brickes, or else a pan of fresh burning coales, and hold it nigh vnto his belly and flankes, to the en∣tent that they may bee thoroughly warmed, and being so warmed annoint them al ouer with oyle de Bav, or Dialthea, to defend his body from the cold, and let his head be well couered, and al his bely kept warme. Yea and it were good to bath his head sometime, as Russius saith, with a bath made of Rew, Wormewoode, Sage, Iuneper, Bay leaues, and Hysop. And let his drinke be warme water mingled with Wheat meale; yea, and to make it the more comfortable, it were good as Russius saith, to put thereunto some Cinamon, Ginger, Galingale, & such hot pieces. And his meat in Winter season would bee no other but sodden corne, or warme mashes, made of ground Malt and wheat bran: in summer season if he went to grasse, I think it would do him most good, so that he go in a dry warm ground, for by feeding alwaies downeward, he shall purge his head the better as Russius saith. Thus much of the Glanders, and mourning of the Chine. Now we wil speake som∣what of the strangullion, according to the opinion of the Authors, though not to the sa∣tisfaction perhaps of our English Ferrers. Of the strangullion or Squinancy. THe Strangullion, called of the Latines Angina, according to the Physitians, is an in∣flamation of the inward partes of the throate, and as I saide before, is called of the Greeks Synanchi, which is as much to say in English as strangling, wherof this name strangullion as I thinke is deriued for this disease doth strangle euery man or beast, and therefore is numbred amongst the perilous and sharp diseases called of the Latines Morbi accuti, of which strangilng the physitians in mans body make foure differences. The first and worst is, when no part within the mouth nor without, appereth manifestly to be infla∣med, and yet the patient is in great perill of strangling. The second is, when the inwarde parts of the throat onely be inflamed. The third is, when the inward and outward partes of the throat be both inflamed. The fourth is, when the muscles of the necke are infla∣med, or the inward ioynts thereof so loosened, as they straiten thereby both the throat, or wesand, or wind-pipe: for short breath is incident to all the foure kinds before recited, and they proceede all of one cause: that is to say, of some collerick or bloody-fluxion, which comes out of the branches of the throat-vaines into those parts, and there breedeth some hot inflamation. But now to proue that a horse is subiect to this disease, you shall hear what Absirtus, Hierocles, Vegetius, and others doe say, Absirtus writing to his friend a certaine Ferrer or horse-leach, called Aistoricus, speaketh in this manner. When a Horse hath the strangvllion it quickly killeth him, the signes whereof be these. His temples will be hollow, his tong will swell and hang out of his mouth, his eies also will be swollen, and the passage of his throat stopt so as he can neither eat nor drinke. All these signes be also confirmed by Hierocles. Moreouer, Vegetius rendereth the cause of this disease, affirming that it proceedeth of aboundance of subtile blood, which after long trauell will inflame the inward or outward muscles of the throat or wisand, or such affluence of blood may come, by vse of hot meats after great trauell, being so alteratiue, as they cause those parts to swell in such sort as the Horse can neither eat nor drinke, nor draw his breath. The cure according to vegetius, is in this sort. First bath his mouth and tongue well with hot water, and then annoint it with the gal of a Bull, that done giue him this drinke. Take of old oyle two pound, of olde wine a quart, nine figs, and nine Leekes heads well stamped and braied together. And after you haue boiled these a while before you straine them, put therunto a little Nitrum Alexandrinum, and giue him a quarte of this euery morning and euening. Absirtus and Hierocles would haue you to let him blood in the palate of his mouth, and also to poure wine and oile into his nostrils and also giue him to drinke this decoction of Figs and Nitrum sodden toge∣ther, or else to anoint his throat within with nitre oyle and hony, or else with hony & hogs dung mingled together, which differeth not much from Galen his medicine, to be giuen vnto man. For he saith, that hony mingled with the powder of hogs dung that is white, and swallowed downe, doth remedy the squanancy presently. Absirtus also praiseth the oyntment made of Bdellium, and when the inflamation beginneth somwhat to decrease, he saieth it is good to purge the horse, by giuing him wild Cocumber, and Nitre to drink. Let his meat be grasse if it may be gotten, or else wet hay, and sprinkled with Nitre. Let his drinke also be lukewarme water, with some barly meale in it. Of the Cough. OF Coughes, some be outward and some be inwarde. Those bee outward which doe come of outward causes, as by eating a feather, or by eating dusty or sharpe straw and such like things: which tickling his throate, causeth him to cough: you shal per∣ceiue it by wagging and wrying his head in his coughing, and by stamping somtime with his foote, laboring to get out the thing that grieueth him, and cannot. The cure accor∣ding to Martin is thus. Take a Willow wand, rowled throughout with a fine linnen clout, and then annoint it all ouer with hony, and thrust it downe his throat, drawing your hand to and fro, to the intent it may either driue down the thing that grieueth him, or else bring it vp, and do this twice or thrice, annointing euery time the sticke with fresh hony. Of the inward and wet cough. OF inward Coughs some be wet and some be dry. The wet cough is that commeth of cold, taken after some great heat giuen to the Horsse, dissoluing humors, which being afterward congealed, do cause obstruction and stopping in the lungs. And I call it the wet cough, because the Horse in his coughing, will voide moist matter at his mouth after that it is once broken. The signes be these. The Horsse will be heauy, and his eies wil run a water, and he wil forsake his meate, and when he cougheth, he thrusteth out his head, and reacheth with great paine at the first, as though hee had a dry cough, vntill the fleame be broken, and then hee will cough more hollow, which is a signe of amend∣ment. And therfore, according to Martins experience, to the intent the fleam may breake the sooner, it shal be necessary to keepe him warme, by clothing him with a double cloth, and by littering him vp to the belly with fresh straw, and then to giue him this drinke: take of barly one peck, and boile it in 2. or 3. gallons of faire water, vntil the barly begin to burst, and boile therewith of bruised Licoras, of Annis-seedes, or Raisins, of each one pound, then straine it, and to that liquor put of hony a pinte, and a quarterne of Sugar candy, and keepe it close in a pot to serue the horse therwith foure seuerall mornings, and cast not a∣way the sodden barly with the rest of the strainings, but make it hot euery day to perfume the horse withal, being put in a bag, and tyed to his hed, and if the horse will eat of it, it shal do him the more good. And this perfuming in winter season would be vsed about ten of the clocke in the morning, when the Sun is of some height, to the intent the horse may be walked abroad, if the Sun shine, to exercise him moderatly. And vntill his cough weare a∣way, faile not to giue him warm water, with a little ground mault. And as his cough brea∣keth more and more, so let his water euery be lesse warmed then other. Of the dry cough. THis seemeth to come of some grosse and tough humor cleauing hard to the hollow places of the lungs which stoppeth the wind-pips, so as the horse cannot easily draw his breath, and if it continue, it wil either grow to the pursick, or else breake his wind altogether. The signs be these. He wil cough both often, drily, and also vehemently, with∣out, voiding at the nose, or mouth. The cure, according to Martin, is in this sort. Take a close earthen pot, and put therein three pints of strong vineger, and foure egs, shels and all vnbroken, and foure Garlike heads cleane pilled and bruised, and set the pot being very close couered in some warme dunghill, and there let it stand a whole night: and the next morning with your hand take out the egges, which will be so soft as silke, and lay them by, vntill you haue strained the Garlike and Vineger through a faire cloath, then put to that liquor, a quarterne of hony, and halfe a quarterne of Sugarcandy, and two ounces of Ly∣coras, and two ounces of Annis-seedes, beaten al into fine powder. And then the Horsse hauing fasted al the night before, in the morning betwixt seuen and eight of the clocke, open his mouth with a cord, and whorle therein one of the egges, so as he may swallow it downe, and then immediately poure in after it a horneful of the aforesaide drinke, being first made lukewarme, and cast in another egge, with another horne full af drinke, and so continue to do, vntill he hath swallowed vp all the egges, and drunke vp all the drinke: and then bridle him, and couer him with warmer cloathes then he had before, and bring him into the stable, and ther let him stand on the bit, at the bare rack, wel littered vp to the bel∣ly, the space of two houres. Then vnbit him, and if it be in winter, offer him a handfull of wheaten straw: if in summer giue him grasse, and let him eat no hay, Blundevil vnlesse it be very wel dusted, and sprinkled with water, and giue him not much thereof. And therefore you shal need to giue him the more prouender, which also most be wel clensed of al filth and dust, and giue him no water, the space of 9. daies. And if you perceiue that the cough doth not weare away, then if it be in winter, purge him with these pilles. Take of lard two pound laid in water two houres: then take nothing but the cleane fat thereof, and stamp it in a mor∣ter, and thereto put of Licoras, of Annis-seeds, of Fenegreeke, of each beaten into pow∣der three ounces, of Aloes in powder two ounces, of Agerick one ounce. Knead these to∣gether like paast, and make thereof six bals as big as an egge. Then the horse hauing fasted ouer night, giue him the next morning these pilles one after another, anointed with hony and oile mingled together in a platter, and to the intent he may swallow them down whe∣ther he wil or not, when you haue opened his mouth catch hold of his tong, and hold it fast while you whirle in one of the pil , that done, thrust it into his throat with a roling-pin, & then let his tongue go vntill he hath swallowed it downe: then giue him in like manner all the rest of the pilles, and let him stand on the bit warme cloathed and littered, the space of three houres at the least, and after that, giue him a little wet hay, and warme water with a little ground mault in it to drinke, and let him drinke no other but warme water the space of a weeke. And now and then in a faire sunny day, it shall be good to trot him one houre abroad to breath him. Of the fretized, broken and rotten lungs. THis proceedeth as Absirtus and Theomnestus saith, either of an extreame cough, or of vehement running, or leaping, or of ouer greedy drinking after great thirst for the lungs be inclosed in a very thin filme or skin, and therefore easie to be broken, which if it be not cured in time, doth grow to apostumation, and to corruption, oppres∣sing all the lungs, which of old Authors is called Vomica, and Supp ratio. But Theomnestus saith, that broken lungs, and rotten lungs, be two diuers diseases, and haue diuers signes, and diuers cures. The signes of broken lungs be these. The Horse draweth his wind short, and by little at once, he will turne his head often toward the place grieued, and groneth in his breathing, he is afraid to cough, and yet cougheth as though he had eaten small bones. The same Theomnestus healed a friends horse of his, whose lunges were fretized, or rather broken as he saith, by continual eating salt, with this manner of cure here following. Let the Horsse haue quiet and rest, and then let him blood in the hanches, where the vaines appeare most: and giue him to drinke the space of seuen daies barly or rather Otes sodden in Goates milke: or if you can get no milke, boile it in water, and put therein some thicke collops of larde and of Deeres sewet, and let him drinke that: and let his common drinke in winter season be the decoction of wheat meale, and in summer time, the decoction of barly, and this as he sayth wil binde his lungs againe together. Vegetius vtterly disalloweth letting of blood in any such disease as this is, & all maner of sharp medicynes, for feare of prouoking the cough, by means wherof the broken places can neuer heale perfectly. And therfore neither his medicines nor meat would be harsh, but smooth, gentle and cooling. The best medicine that may be giuen him at all times is this: take of Fenegreeke, and of Linceede, of each halfe a pound, of Gum dragagant, of Mastick, of Myrrhe, of Sugar, of Fitch flower, of each one ounce. Let all these things be beaten into fine powder, and then infused one whole night in a sufficient quantity of warme Water, and the next day giue him a quarte of this lukewarme, putting thereunto two or three ounces of oile of Roses, continuing so to do many dayes together, and if the disease be new, this wil heal him: yea and it will ease him very much although the disease be old, which is thought vncurable. And in winter season so long as he standeth in the stable, let him drink no cold water, and let his meat be cleane without dust, but in summer season it were best to let him runne to grasse, for so long as he eateth grasse, a man shalscantly perceiue this disease. Thus much of broken lungs. Of putrified and rotten lungs. THe signes to know whether a Horsses lungs be putrified or rotten, according to Theomnestus are these. The Horsse will eat and drinke greedilyer then he was wont to do, he shal be oftner vexed with a cough, and in coughing he will cast little lumps of matter out at his mouth. The cure whereof according to Theomnestus, is thus. Giue him to drinke euery morning, the space of seuen daies the iuyce of Purslain mingled with Oyle of Roses, and ad thereunto a little tragagantum that hath been layed before in steep in Goates milke, or else in Barly or Oten milke, strained out of the corne. When the A∣postume is broken, then a very strong vile and euill sauour will come out of his Nostrils: for remedy whereof, it shall be good to giue him the space of seuen daies this drink here following: take of the roote called Costus two ounces, and of Casia or else of Cinamon three ounces beaten into fine powder, and a fewe Raisins, and giue it him to drinke with wine. But Vegetius would haue him to be cured in this sort and with lesse cost I assure you. Take of Frankincense and Aristoloch, of each two ounces, beaten into fine powder, and giue him that with wine, or else take of vnburnt Brimstone two ounces, and of Aristoloch one ounce and a halfe beaten into powder, and giue him that with wine. And hee would haue you also to draw his breast with a hot iron, to the intent the humors may issue forth outwardly. Of shortnesse of breath. A Horsse may haue shortnesse of breath, by hasty running after drinking, or vpon a full stomach, or by the discending of humors vnto his throat or lungs, after som ex∣treame heate dissoluing the said humors, which so long as there is nothing broken, may in the beginning be easily holpen. The signes bee these. The Horsse will continually pant, and fetch his breath short, which wil come very hot out at his nose, and in his brea∣thing he will squise in the nose, and his flanks will beate thicke▪ yea and some cannot fetch their breath vnlesse they hold their neckes right out and straight, which disease is called of the old writers by the Greeke name Orthopnoea. The cure. Let him blood in the neck, and giue him this drinke, take of wine, and oile, of each a pint, of Frankincense halfe an ounce, and of the iuyce of Horehound halfe a pinte. It is good also to poure into his throate ho∣ny, butter and Hogs-greace moulten together, and made lukewarme. Tiberius saith, it is good to giue him whole egges, shels and all, steeped and made soft in vineger: that is to say, the first day three, the second day fiue, and the third day seuen, and to power wine and and oile into his nostrils. I for my part would take nothing but Annis-seedes, Licoras, and Sugarcandy, beaten all into fine powder, giue him that to drinke, with wine and oile ming∣led together. Of the Pursicke. THis is a shortnes of breath, and the horse that is so diseased is called of the Italians, Cauallo pulsiuo, or Bolse, which I thinke is deriued of the Latin word Vulsus, by chan∣ging V. into B. and I think differeth not much from him that hath broken lungs, cal∣led of vegetius and other old writers vulsus, for such shortnesse of breath coms either of the same causes, or else much like, as aboundance of grosse humors, cleauing harde to the hollow places of the lungs, and stopping the wind-pips. And the wind being kept in, doth resort downeward as Russius saith, into the Horsses guts, and so causeth his flanks to beat continually without order: that is to say, more swiftly and hier vp to the backe, then the flankes of any Horsse that is sound of wind. And if the disease be old, it is seldome or ne∣uer cured, and though I finde many medicines, prescrided by diuers Authors, fewe or none do content me, vnlesse it be that of Vegetius, recited before in the Chapter of broken lungs. And if that preuaileth not, then I thinke it were not amisse according to Russius to purge him with this drinke, heere following: take of Maiden haire, of Ireos, of Ash, of Li∣coras, of Fenegreeke, of Raisins, of each halfe an ounce, of Cardanum, of pepper, Blundevile of bit∣ter Almonds, of Baurach, of each, two ounces, of nettle seede, and of Aristoloch, of each three ounces, boile them al together in a sufficient quantity of water, and in that decocti∣on dissolue halfe an ounce of Agarike, and two oun▪ of Coloquintida, together with two pound of Hony, and giue him of this a pinte or a quarte at diuers times: and if it be too thick make it thinner, by putting therunto water wherin Licoras hath beene sodden, and if neede be you may also draw both his flankes crosse-wise with a hot iron, to restraine the beating of them, and also slit his Nostrils, to giue him more aire. And if it bee in summer turne him to grasse, if in winter let him be kept warme, and giue him now and then a little sodden wheat. Russius would haue it to bee giuen him three daies together and also newe sweet wine to drinke, or else other good wine mingled with Licoras water. Of a Consumption. A Consumption is none other thing but an exulceration of the lunges, proceeding of some fretting or gnawing humor, descending out of the head into the lungs. And I take it to be that disease which the old writers are wont to cal the dry Malady: which perhaps some wold rather interpret to be the mourning of the chine, with whom I intend not to striue. But thus much I must needes say, that euery Horsse hauing the mourning of the Chine, doth continually cast at the nose, but in the dry Malady it is contrary. For all the Authors that write thereof affirme, that the Horsse auoideth nothing at the Nose. And the signs be to know the dry Malady, according to their doctrin, be these. His flesh doth cleane consume away, his belly is gaunt, and the skinne thereof so harde stretched, or rather shrunke vp, as if you strike on him with your hand it will sound like a Tabar, and he will be hollow backt, and forsake his meat, and though he eateth it, (as Absirtus saith) yet he doth not digest it, nor prospereth not withall, he would cough and cannot but hicking∣ly, as though he had eaten small bones. And this disease is iudged of all the Authors to be incurable. Notwithstanding, they say, that it is good to purge his head with such per∣fumes as haue beene shewed you before in the Chapter of the Glanders, and also to giue him alwaies Coleworts, chopt small with his prouender. Some would haue him to drinke the warme blood of sucking pigs new slaine, and some the iuyce of Leekes, with oile and wine mingling together. Others praise wine and Frankincense, some oyle and Rue, some would haue his body to be purged and set to grasse. Of the consumption of the flesh, and how to make a leane Horse fat. MArtin saith that if a Horse take a great cold after a heat it wil cause his flesh to wast, and his skin to wax hard and dry, and to cleaue fast to his sides, and hee shall haue no appetite vnto his meat, and the fillets of his backe wil fal away, and all the flesh of his buttocks, and of his shoulders, will be consumed▪ The cure whereof is thus. Take two sheepes heads vnflead, boile them in three gallons of Ale, or faire running water, vntill the flesh be consumed from the bones, that done, strain it through a fine cloth, and then put thereunto of Sugar one pound, of Cinamon two ounces, of conserue of Roses, of Barberries, of Cherries, of each two ounces, and mingle them together, and giue the Horsse euery day in the morning, a quart thereof lukewarme, vntil all be spent: and after euery time he drinketh, let him be walked vp and downe in the stable, or else abroade if the weather be warme, and not windy, and let him neither eate nor drinke in two houres after, and let him drinke no cold water, but lukewarme, the space of fifteene daies, and let him be fed by little and little, with such meate as the Horse hath most appetite vnto. But if the horse be nesh and tender, & so wax lean without any apparant griefe or disease, then the old writers would haue him to be fed now and then with partched Wheat, and also to drinke Wine with his water, and eate continually wheate bran mingled with his prouen∣der, vntill hee waxe stronge, and hee must be often dressed and trimmed, and lye softe, without the which things his meat will do him but little good. And his meat must be fine and cleane, and giuen him often and by litttle at once. Russius saith, that if a Horsse eating his meat with good appetite, doth not for al that prosper, but is stil leane: then it is good to giue him Sage, Sauin, Bay berries, Earth-nuttes, and Boares greace, to drinke with wine: or to giue him the intrals of a Barbell or Tench, with white Wine. He saith also that sodden Beanes mingled with Branne and Salt, will make a leane Horsse fat in very short space. Of griefe in the breast. Blundevile L Aurentius Russius writeth of a disease called in Italian Grauezza di petto, which hath not beene in experience amongst our Ferrers, that I can learn. It coms, as Russius saith, of the superfluity of blood, or other humors dis∣solued by some extreame heat, and resorting down the breast, paining the Horsse, so as he cannot well go. The cure whereof according to Russius is thus. Let him bloode on both sides of the breast in the accostomed vaines, and rowell him vnder the breast, and twice a daye turne the rowells with your hand, to mooue the humours that they may yssue forth, and let him goe so roweled the space of fifteene daies. Of the paine of the heart called Anticor, that is to say, Contrary to the heart. T His proceedeth of aboundance of ranke blood bred with good feeding & ouermuch rest: which blood resorting to the inward parts doth suffocate the heart, and many times causeth swellinges to appeare before the breast, which will grow vpwarde to the necke, and then it killeth the Horsse. The signes. The Horse will hang downe his head in the manger, forsaking his meate, and is not able to lift vp his head. The cure according to Martin is thus. Let him blood on both sides aboundantly in the plat vaines, and then giue him this drinke: take a quart of malmesie, and put thereunto halfe a quarterne of Sugar, and two ounces of Ci∣namon, and giue it him lukewarme, then keepe him warme in the stable, stuffing him well about the stomach that the wind offend him no manner of way, and giue him warme wa∣ter with mault alawies to drinke, and giue him such meate as he will eate. And if the swel∣ling do appeare, then besides letting him blood, strike the swelling in diuers places with your fleame that the corruption may goe forth: and annoint the place with warme Hogs greace, and that wil either make it to weare away or else to grow to a head, if it be couered and kept warme. Of tired Horsses. BIcause we are in hand heere with the vitall partes, and that when the Horsses be tyred with ouermuch labour, their vitall spirits wax feeble, I thinke it best to speak of them euen heere, not with long discoursing as Vegetius vseth, but briefely to shew you how to refresh the poore Horsse hauing neede thereof, which is doone chiefely by giuing him rest, warmth and good feeding, as with warme mashes and plenty of prouender. And to quicken his spirits, it shall be good to poure a little oyle and vineger into his Nostrils, and to giue him the drinke of sheeps heads recited before in the Chapter of consumption of the flesh, yea and also to bath his Legges with this bath: take of Mallowes, of Sage, of each two or three handfuls, and a Rose-cake: boile these things together, and being boy∣led, then put vnto it a good quantity of butter or of Sallet-oyle. Or else make him this charge: take of Bole Armony and of Wheat-flower of each halfe a pound, and a little Ro∣zen beaten into powder, and a quart of strong vineger, and mingle them together, and couer all his Legs therewith, and if it be summer, turne him to grasse. Of the diseased parts vnder the midriffe, and first of the stomacke. THe old Authors make mention of many diseases incident to a horses stomacke, as loathing of meat, spewing vp his drinke, surfetting of prouender, the hungry euil, and such like, which few of our Ferrers haue obserued: and therefore I wil breefely speake of as many as I thinke necessary to bee knowne, and first of the loathing of meate. Blundevile Of the loathing of meat. A Horsse may loath his meat through the imtemperature of his stomack, as for that it is too hot or too cold. If his stomacke be too hot, then most common∣ly it will either inflame his mouth and make it to breake out in blisters, yea and perhaps cause some cancker to breed there. The cure of all which things hath beene taught before. But if he forsake his meat onely for very heat, which you shall perceiue by the hotnesse of his breath and mouth, then coole his stomack by giuing him cold water mingled with a little Vineger and oile to drinke, or else giue him this drinke. Take of milke, and of wine, of each one pinte, and put thereunto three ounces of Me Ro∣satum, and wash al his mouth with Vineger and salt. If his stomacke be too colde, then his haire wil stare and stand right vp, which Absirtus and others were wont to cure, by giuing the horse good wine and oile to drinke, and some would seeth in wine Rew, or Sage, some would adde thereunto white Pepper and Mirre, some woulde giue him Onions and Roc∣ket seed to drinke with wine, Againe there be other somewhich prescribe the blood of a young Sow with old wine. Absirtus would haue the horse to eat the green blades of wheat, if the time of the yeare wil serue for it. Columella saith, that if a horsse or anie other beaste, do loath his meate it is good to giue him wine, and the seede of Gith, or else Wine and stampt garlicke. Of casting out his drinke. VEgetius saith, that the horse may haue such a Palsie proceeding of cold in his stomack as he is notable to keepe his drinke, but many times to cast it out again at his mouth. The remedy whereof is to let him blood in the necke, and to giue him cordiall drinkes, that is to say, made of hotte and comfortable spices, and also to annoint al his breast and vnder his shoulders with hot oyles, and to purge his head, by blowing vp into his No∣strils, pouders that prouoke neezing, such as haue beene taught you before. Of surfetting with glut of prouender. THe glut of prouender or other meat not digested, doth cause a horse to haue great paine in his body, so as hee is not able to stande on his feete, but lyeth downe, and waltereth as though he had the Bots. The cure whereof according to Martins expe∣rience, is in this sort. Let him blood in the necke, then trot him vppe and downe for the space of an houre, and if he cannot stale, draw out his yard, and wash it with a little white wine, luke warme, and thrust into his yard either a brused cloue of Garlicke, or else a lit∣tle oile of Cammomile, with a wax candle. If he cannot dung, then rake his fundament, and giue him this glister. Take of Mallows two or three handfuls, and boile them in a pot∣tle of faire running water, and when the mallows be sodden, then straine it, and put there∣vnto a quart of fresh Butter, and halfe a pinte of oile Oliue; and hauing receiued this gli∣ster, lead him vp and downe, vntill he hath emptied his belly, then set him vp, and keepe him hungry the space of three or foure daies, and the hay that he eateth, let it be sprinke∣led with water, and let him drinke water, wherein should be put a little bran, and when he hath drunke, giue him the bran to eate, and giue him little or no prouender at al, for the space of eight or ten daies. Of another kind of surfetting with meat or drinke, called of vs, foundering in the body. THis disease is called of the old writers in Greeke Crithiasis, in Latine Hordiatio, it commeth as they say, by eating of much prouender suddainely after labour, whilst the horse is hot and panting, Blundevile whereby his meate not being digested, breedeth e∣uill humors, which by little and little do spread thoroughout his members, and at length do oppresse all his body, and doe cleane take away his strength, and make him in such a case, as he can neither goe, nor bow his ioyntes, nor being laide, he is not able to rise a∣gaine, neither can he stale but with great paine. It may come also, as they saie, of drinking too much in trauelling by the waie when the horse is hot, but then it is not so dangerous, as when it commeth of eating too much. But howsoeuer it commeth, they saie all, that the humours will immediatelie resorte downe into the horses legges, and feet, and make him to cast his hooues: and therfore I must needs iudge it to be no other thing but a plaine foundering, which word foundering is borrowed, as I take it, of the French word Fundu, that is to say, molten. For foundering is a melting or dissolution of humors, which the Italians cal Infusione. Martin maketh di∣uers kindes of foundering, as the foundering of the bodie, which the French men call most commonly Morfundu, and foundering in the legs and feet, also foundering before and behind, which some Authors doe denie, as Magister Maurus, and Laurentius Russius, affirming that there are fewer humors behind than before, and that they cannot easily be dissolued or molten, being so far distant from the hart, & the other vital parts. Where∣unto a man might answere, that the natural heat of the hart doth not cause dissolution of humors, but some vnnaturall and accidentall heate, spred throughout all the members, which is daily proued by good experience. For we see horses foundered not only before or behind, but also of al foure legs at once, which most commonly chanceth either by ta∣king cold sodenly after a great heate, as by standing stil vpon some cold pauement, or a∣broad in the cold wind, or els perhaps the horse trauelling by the way, and being in a sweat was suffred to stand in some cold water whilst he did drinke, which was worse then his drin∣king: for in the mean time the cold entering at his feet, ascended vpward, and congealed the humors which the heat before had dissolued, and thereby when he commeth once to rest, he waxeth stiffe and lame of his legs But leauing to speak of foundering in the legs, as wel before as behind, vntil we come to the griefs in the legs & feet, we intend to talk here only of foundring in the body, according to Martins experience. The signes to know if a horse be foundered in the body, be these. His haire wil stare and he wil be chil, and shrug for cold, and forsake his meat, hanging down his head, and quiuer after cold water, and af∣ter 2. or 3. daies he wil begin to cough. The cure, according to Martin is thus. First scour his belly with the glister last mentioned, and then giue him a comfortable drink made in this sort. Take of Malmsie a quart, of Sugar halfe a quartern▪ of hony halfe a quarterne, of Sinamon halfe an ounce, of Licoras and Annis seedes, of each two spoonfuls, beaten into fine powder, which being put into the Malmsie, warme them togither at the fire, so as the hony may be molten, and then giue it him luke warm: that done, walke him vp and down in the warme stable the space of halfe an houre, and then let him stand on the bit 2. or 3. houres without meat, but let him be warme couered, and wel littered, and giue him hay sprinkled with a little water, and clean sifted prouender by a little at once, and let his water be warmed with a little ground Malt therein. And if you see him somewhat cheered, then let him blood in the neck, and also perfume him once a day with a little Frankincense, and vse to walke him abroad when the weather is faire and not windy, or els in the house if the weather be foule: and by thus vsing him you shal quickly recouer him. Of the hungry euill. THis is a verie great desire to eat, following some great emptinesse, or lacke of meate, and it is called of the olde Authorus by the Greeke name Bulimos, which is as much to say, as a great hunger proceeding, as the Physitians say, at the first of some extreame outward cold, taken by long trauelling in cold barren places, and especially where snow aboundeth, which outward cold causeth the stomacke to be cold, and the inward powers to be feeble. The cure according to Absyrtus and Hierocles, is in the beginning to com∣fort the horses stomacke, by giuing him bread sopt in wine. And if you be in a place of rest, to giue him wheat flower and wine to drinke, or to make him cakes or bals of flow∣er and wine kneaded togither, and to feed him with that, or with wine and nuttes of pine trees. Hierocles saith, if any such thing chaunce by the way whereas no flower is to be had, then it shall be best to giue him wine and earth wrought togither, either to drinke or else to eate in bals. Of the disease in the liuer. A Ll the olde Authors speake much of the paine in the liuer, but none of them do declare whereof it commeth, or by what meanes, sauing that Hippocrates saith, that some horses get it by violent running vpon some stony or hard ground. I for my part thinke that the liuer of a horse is subiect to as many diseases as the liuer of a man, and therefore may be pained diuersly. As sometime by the intemperatnesse of the same, as for that it is perhaps too hot, or too cold, too moist, or too dry: sometimes by meanes of euill humors, as choler, or flegme abounding in the same, according as the liuer is ey∣ther hot or cold: for heat breedeth choler, and cold, flegme, by means of which intem∣perature proceedeth all the weakenes of the liuer. It may be pained also sometime by ob∣struction and stopping, and sometime by hard knobs, inflammation, Apostume, or vlcer bred therein, sometime by consumption of the substance thereof. The signes of heate and hot humors, be these, loathing of meat, great thirst, and loosenes of belly, voiding dung of strong sent, and leannesse of body. The signes of cold, and cold humors be these: ap∣petite to meat without thirst, a belly neither continually loose nor stiptike, but betweene times, no strong sent of dung, nor leannesse of body, by which kind of signes, both firste and last mentioned, and such like, the weakenesse & greefe of the liuer is also to bee lear∣ned and sought out. Obstruction or stopping most commonly chanceth by trauelling or laboring vpon a full stomacke, whereby the meat not being perfectly digested, breedeth grosse and tough humours, which humours by vehemency of the labour, are also driuen violently into the small vaines, whereby the liuer should receiue good nutriment, and so breedeth obstruction and stopping. The signes whereof in mans body is heauinesse and distension, or swelling, with some griefe in the right side vnder the short ribs, and espe∣cially when he laboureth imediately after meat, which things I beleeue if it were diligent¦ly obserued, were easie enough to find in a horse, by his heauie going at his setting forth and often turning his head to the side greeued. Of an olde obstruction, and especially if the humors be cholericke, breedeth many times a harde knob on the liuer, called of the Physitians Schirrus, which in mans body may be felt, if the body bee not ouer fat: and it is more easie for him to lie on the right side than on the lefte, because that lying on the left side, the weight of the knob would oppresse the stomacke and vitall partes verye sore, by which signes methinkes a dilligent Ferrer may learne, whether a horse hath any such disease or not. The inflammation of the liuer commeth by meanes that the blood either through the abundance, thinnesse, boiling heat, or sharpenes thereof, or else through the violence of some outwarde cause, breaketh out of the vaines, and floweth into the bodie of the liuer, and there being out of his proper vessels doth immediatly putrifie and is in∣flamed, and therewith corrupteth so much fleshie substaunce of the liuer as is imbrewed withall; and therefore for the most part, the hollow side of the liuer is consumed: yea, and sometime the full side. This hotte bloody matter then is properlie called an inflammation, which by naturall heate is afterwarde turned into a plaine corruption, and then it is called an Impostume, which if it breake out and run, then it is called an Vlcer, or filthie sore: Thus you see, of one euill Fountaine may spring diuers greefs, requiring diuers cures. And thogh none of mine Authours, nor anie other Ferrer that I know haue waded thus farre, yet I thought good by writing thus much, Blundevile to giue such Ferrers as be wise, discreet and diligent, occa∣sion to seeke for more knowledge and vnderstanding than is taught them, and methinkes that it is a great shame, that the Ferrers of this age should not know much more than the Ferrers of old time, sith that besides that, the olde mens knowledge is not hidden from them, they haue also their own experience, and time also bringeth euery day new things to light. But now to proceede in discoursing of the liuer according to the Physitians doc∣trine as I haue begunne, I say then of an inflammation in the hollowe side of the liuer, the signes be these: loathing of meat, great thirst, loosenes of belly, easie lyeng on the right side, and paineful lyeng on the left. But if the inflammation be on the full side or swelling side of the liuer, then the patient is trobled with difficulty of breathing, with a dry cough and greeuous paine, pulling and twitching the wind-pipe, and to lie vpon the right side is more painful than the left, and the swelling may be felt with a mans hande. But you must vnderstand by the way, that al these things last mentioned be the signes of some great in¦flammation, for smal inflammations haue no such signes, but are to be iudged onely by griefe vnder the short ribs and fetching of the breath. The signes of Apostumation is paineful and great heate. The signes of Vlcerations is decrease of the heat with feeblenes and fainting. For the filthy matter flowing abroad with euil vapours corrupteth the heart, and many times causeth death. The signes of the consumption of the liuer, shal bee declared in the next chapter, and as for the curing of al other diseases before mentioned, experience must first teach it ere I can write it. Not∣withstanding, I cannot thinke but that such things as are good to heale the like diseases in mans body are also good for a horse, for his liuer is like in substaunce and shape to a mans liuer, differing in nothing but onely in greatnesse. And therefore I would wish you to learne at the Physitians hands, who I am sure first, as touching the weakenes of the Li∣uer, proceeding of the vntemperatenes thereof, wil bid you to heale euery such vntem∣peratnes by his contrary; that is to say, heat, by colde, and drinesse by moisture: and so contrary: And therefore it shal bee verye necessary for you to learne the qualities, na∣tures, and vertues of hearbs, drugs, and al other simples, and how to apply them in time. And for to heale the obstruction of the liuer, they wil counsel you perhaps to make the horse drinkes of such simples as these be, Agrimony, Fumitory, Camomile, Worme-wood, Licoras, Annis seeds, Smallage, Persly, Spiknard, Gentian, Succorie, Endiue, Sperage, Lupins, the vertues whereof you shall learne in the herbals: but amongest all simples, there is none more praised than the liuer of a Woolfe beaten into powder, and mingled in any medicine that is made for any disease in the liuer. The cure of an inflammation consisteth in letting blood, and in bathing, or fomenting the sore place with such hearbes and oyles, as may mollifie and disperse humors abroad, wherewith some simples that be astrigent would be alwaies mingled: yea, and in al other medicines that be applyed to the liuer, for any manner of diseases. Simples that mollifie and disperse be these: Linseed, Fenegreeke: Camomel, Annis seedes, Meliot: and such like things. Simples astringent be these: Red Rose leaues, Bramble leaues, Wormwood, Plantaine, Mirrhe, Masticke, Stirax, and such like. Apostumes are to be ripend and voi∣ded. Vlcers must be clensed, and scowred downward either by the belly or by Vrine: and therefore the vse of such simples as prouoke vrine in such case is necessary: The olde wri∣ters of horseleach craft do say, that when a horse is greeued in his liuer, he wil forsake his meat, and his body wil waste, his mouth wil be dry, his tongue rough and harsh: yea, and it wil smel, and he wil refuse to lye on that side where his griefe is. The cure whereof accor∣ding to Absirtus is in this sort. Let him drink stampt Ireos with wine alayed with water. Hee praiseth also an hearbe much like vnto Calamint: called of Pliny, Polymoria, or let him drinke Sauerie with wine and oyle. I thinke that Agrimony or liuer-woort is as good as the best of them. Absirtus would haue his body to be chafed with wine and oile mixt to¦gither: and to be wel littered that he may lie soft: and his prouender that should be gi∣uen him to be steeped first in warme water: and now and then some Nitrum to be put in his drinke. Of the consumption in the Liuer. I Beleeue that no inward member of a horse doth suffer so much as the lungs and liuer, and that not so much by continual as by vnordinate, and vntimely trauaile, labour, and exercise, whereby either the horses lunges, or his liuer do most commonly perish, and is consumed: yea, and sometime both. Of the consumption of the lungs, we haue talked sufficiently before: therefore let vs shew you heere the causes whereof the con∣sumption of the liuer proceedeth. The Physitians say, that it may come of anie humour, but chiefelie and most commonlie of cholericke matter, shed throughout the substance of the liuer, which putrifieng by little and little, and leisurely, doeth at length corrupt and perish all the substance of the liuer, which thing in mans body doth first proceede, as the physitians say, either by eating corrupt meates, or else by continuall drinking of sweet wines. But methinkes that the consumption of a horses liuer, should come by some extream heat, inflaming the blood, which afterward being putrified, doeth corrupt and exulce∣rate the substance of the liuer. For after inflammation, as I saide before, commeth Apo∣stumation, and then exulceration, which is very hard to cure, because the substance of the liuer is spongeous like vnto the Lunges. And whilst the liuer is so corrupted, there can bee no good digestion, for lacke whereof the body receiueth no good nutriment, and therefore must needes also languish and consume. The signes according to Mar∣tin be these. The horse will forsake his meat, and wil stande stretching himselfe in length, and ne∣uer couet to lie downe, and his breath will be so strong, as no man can abide it, and he wil continually cast yellowish matter at the one nostrill, or else at both, according as one or both sides of the lyuer is corrupted, and on that side that he casteth most, he will haue vn∣der his iaw, euen about the midst thereof a knob or kirnell as much as a Walnut, which when Martin findeth, hee committeth his carcasse to the Crowes, taking him to bee past cure. But if he were let blood in time, and had such drinkes giuen him, as are good to comfort and strength the liuer, he thinketh that the horse might be recouered. I neuer read any medicine for the wasting of the liuer, as I remember, but this onely diet, which I found in an olde English booke. Let him drinke for the space of three daies no other thing but warme wort, and let him eate no other meat but Oates baked in an ouen, and let him stand meatlesse the first night before you giue him the woort: But I thinke it were not amisse to put into the wort that he drinketh euery morning some good confection or powder made of Agrimony, red Rose leaues, Saccharum, Rosaceum, Diarchadon, Abba∣tis, Diasantalon, Licoras and of the liuer of a Woolfe, and such other simples as doe comfort and strengthen the liuer, or else to giue him the same things with Goates milke lukewarme. Of the diseases in the Gall. I N my opinion the gall of a horse is subiect to diuers diseases, as wel as the gal of a man, as to obstruction, whereof commeth the fulnesse and emptines of the bladder and likewise the stone in the gall. But obstruction may chaunce two manner of waies: First, when the waie, whereby the choler should pro∣ceede from the liuer vnto the bladder of the gall as vnto his receptacle, is stopped, and thereby the bladder remaineth empty, whereof may spring diuers euill accidents: as vo∣mitting, the lax or bloody flix. Secondly, when the way whereby such choler should ys∣sue forth of the bladder of the Gall downe into the guts is shut vp, wherby the bladder is ouer full and aboundeth with too much choler, which causeth heauinesse, suffocation, belching, heat, thirst, and disposition to angrinesse. The signes of both kinds of obstructi∣on in the gall is costiuenes and yellowishnes of skin infected with the yellow Iaundis. The stone in the gall which is somewhat blackish proceedeth of the obstruction of the con∣duites of the bladder, whereby the choler being long kept in, waxeth dry and turneth at length to harde grauell or stones, whereof because there is neither signes nor any gree∣uous accident knowne to the Physitians, I leaue to talke anie farther thereof, and the ra∣ther for that none of mine Authors do make anie mention of the gall at all. Notwithstan∣ding to giue some light vnto the lerned Ferrers, and that they may the better vnderstand the inward partes of a horse, I thought good to write thus much, thinking it no time lost while I may profit them anie way. Of the diseases in the Spleene. THe Splene, as I haue said before in many places, is the receptacle of melancholy, and of the dregs of blood, and is subiect to the like diseases that the liuer is, that is to say, to swelling, obstruction, hard knobs, and inflamation: for the substance of the splene is spongeous, and there sort apt to sucke in al filth and to dilate it selfe, where∣fore being ful it must needs swel, which wil appeare in the left side vnder the short ribs, and such swelling causeth also shortnesse of breath, and especially when the body doth labour or trauel. It is painful also to lie on the right side, because the splene being swollen so oppresseth the midriffe, and especially when the stomacke is ful of meat, and the pati∣ent hath worse disgestion than appetite, and is troubled with much winde, both vpwarde and downeward. Moreouer the vapor of the humor doth offend the hart, making it faint and causeth al the body to be heauy and dul, and if such swelling be suffered to go vncu∣red, then if it be a melancholy humor, and abounding ouer-much, it waxeth euery day thicker and thicker, causing obstruction not onely in the vaines and artires, which is to be perceiued by heauinesse and greefe on the left side, but also in the splene it self, where∣as by vertue of the heat it is hardned euery day more and more, and so by little and lit∣tle waxeth to a hard knob, which doth not only occupy al the substance of the splene, but also many times al the left side of the wombe, and thereby maketh the euil accidents or griefes before recited much more than they were. Now as touching the inflammation of the splene which chaunceth very sildome, for so much as euery inflammation proceedeth of pure blood, which sildome entereth into the splene: I shal not need to make many words, but refer you ouer to the chapter of the Liuer, for in such case they differ not, but proceeding of like cause, haue also like signes, and do require like cure. The old writers say, that horses be often▪ greeued with griefe in the splene, and specially in Summer season with greedy eating of sweet green meats, and they cal those horses Lienosos, that is to say splenetike. The signes whereof (say they) are these, hard swelling on the left side, short breath, often groning, and greedy appetite to meat. The remedie whereof according to Absirtus is to make a horse to sweat once a day during a certaine time, by riding him or otherwise trauelling him, and to poure into his left nostril euery day the iuyce of mirabolans mingled with wine and water, amounting in alto the quantity of a pint. But methinks it would do him more good, if he drank it as Hie∣rocles would haue him to do. Eumelius praiseth this drinke: take of Cummin seed and of hony, of each six ounces, and of Lacerpitium as much as a beane, of Vineger a pint, and put al these into three quartes of water, and let it stand so al night, and the next morning giue the horse thereof to drinke, being kept ouer night fasting. Theomnestus praiseth the decoction of Capers, especially if the barke of the root thereof may be gotten sodden in water to a sirrop. Or else make him a drinke of Garlick, Nitrum, Hore-hound, and worm-wood, sodden in harsh wine: and he would haue the left side to be bathed in warme water and to be hard rubbed. And if al this wil not helpe, then to giue him the fire which Absir∣tus doth not allow saying the splene lyeth so, as it cannot easily bee fired, to do him anye good. But for so much as the liuer and splene are members much occupied in the ingen∣dring and seperating of humors, many euil accidents and griefes doe take their first be∣ginning of them, as the Iandis, called in a horse, the yellowes, drinesse of body, and con∣sumption of the flesh, without any apparant cause why, which the Phisitians call Atrophis also euill habite of the bodie, called of them Chachexia, and the Dropsie. But first wee will speake of the Iaundis or Yellowes. Of the Yellowes. THe Physitians in a mans body do make two kinds of Iandis: that is to say, the Yel∣low proceeding of choler dispersed throughout the whole body, and dieng the skin yellow, and the blacke proceeding of melancholie, dispersed likewise throughout the whole bodie, and making al the skin blacke. And as the yellow Iaundis commeth for the most part, either by obstruction or stopping of the cundits belonging to the bladder of the gall, which (as I said before) is the receptable of Choler, or by some inflamation of the liuer, wherby the blood is conuerted into choler, & so spreadeth throughout the bo∣dy: euen so the black Iandis cōmeth by meane of some obstruction in the liuer-vain, that goeth to the splene, not suffering the spleene to do his office, in receiuing the dregs of the blood from the liuer, wherin they abound too much, or else for that the spleene is already too ful of dregs, and so sheddeth them backe againe into the vaines. But as for the blacke Iandis they haue not bin obserued to be in horses as in mē, by any of our Ferrers in these daies that I can learn. And yet the old writers of horseleach-craft, do seeme to make two kindes of Iandis, called of them Cholera, that is to say, the dry Choler, and also the moist choler. The signs of the dry choler, as Absirtus saith, is great heat in the body, and costiue∣nesse of the belly, wherof it is said to be dry. Moreouer, the horse wil not couet to lie down, because he is so pained in his body, and his mouth will be hot and dry. It commeth, as he saith, by obstruction of the cundit, wherby the choler should resort into the bladder of the gal, and by obstruction also of the vrin vessels, so as he cannot stale. The cure according to his experience, is to giue him a glister made of oile, water and Ni∣trum, & to giue him no prouender, before that you haue raked his fundament, and to po∣wer the decoction of Mallowes mingled with sweet wine into his nostrils and let his meate be grasse, or else sweet hay sprinkled with Nitre and water, and he must rest from labor, & be often rubbed. Hierocles would haue him to drinke the decoction of wild coleworts sod∣den in wine. Again of the moist choler of Iandis, these are the signes. The horses eies will looke yellow, and his nostrils will open wide, his eares and his flanks wil sweat, and his stale will be yellow and cholerick, and he wil grone when he lieth downe, which disease the said Absirtus was wont to heale, as he saith, by giuing the Horsse a drinke made of Time and Cumin, of each like quantity stampt together, and mingled with wine, hony, and water, and also by letting him blood in the pasterns. This last disease seemeth to differ nothing at all from that which our Ferrers cal the yellowes. The signs wherof, according to Martin, be these. The Horse will bee faint, and sweat as hee standeth in the stable, and forsake his meat: and his eies, and the inside of his lips and all his mouth within will be yellow. The cure whereof according to him is in this sort. Let him bloode in the Necke vaine, a good quantity, and then giue him this drinke: take of white wine, of Ale a quart, and put there∣unto of Saffron, turmericke, of each halfe an ounce, and the iuyce that is wroong out of a handfull of Celendine, and being lukewarme, giue it the Horse to drinke, and keepe him warme the space of three or foure daies, giuing him warme water with a little bran in it. Of the Yellowes THe yellowes is a general disease in horsses, and differ nothing from the yellow-iandise in men: it is mortall, and many horses die thereof: the signes to know it is thus: Markham. pull downe the lids of the horsses eies, and the white of the eie will bee yellow, the inside of his lips wil be yellow, and gums, the cure followeth. First let him bloode in the palat of the mouth, that he may suck vp the same, then giue him this drink: take of strong Ale a quart, of the greene ordure of Geese strained, three or foure spoonefuls: of the iuyce of Salen∣dine as much, of saffron halfe an ounce, mix these together, and being warme, giue it the horse to drinke. Of the euill habit of the body, and of the dropsie. AS touching the drines and consumption of the flesh, without any apparant cause why, Blundevile called of the Physitians as I said before Atrophia, I know not what to say more then I haue already before in the chap. of consumption of the flesh, and therefore resort thither. And as for the euil habit of the body, which is to be euil colored, heauy, dul, & of no force, strength, nor liuelines, commeth not for lack of nutriment, but for lack of good nutriment, for that the blood is corrupted with flegme, choler, or melancholy, proceeding either fro the spleene, or else through weakenesse of the stomach or Liuer, causing euill digestion, or it may come by foule feeding: yea, & also for lacke of moderate exercise. The euill habit of the body, is next cosin to the dropsie, whereof though our Ferrers haue had no expe∣rience, yet because mine old Authors writing of horselcach-craft do speak much thereof: I thinke it good heere briefely to shew you their experience therein, that is to say, how to know it, and also how to cure it. But sith none of them do shew the cause whereof it pro∣ceedes, I thinke it meete first therefore to declare vnto you the causes therof, according to the doctrin of the learned Physitians, which in mans body do make three kinds of drop∣sies, calling the first Anasarca, the second Ascites, and the third Timpanias. Anasarca, is an vniuersall swelling of the body through the aboundance of water, lying betwixt the skin and the flesh, and differeth not from the disease last mentioned, called Cachexia, that is to say, euill habit of the bloode, sauing that the body is more swoln in this then in Cachexia, albeit they proceede both of like causes as of coldnesse and weakenesse of the liuer, or by meanes that the hart, spleene, stomack, and other members seruing to digestion, by grie∣ued or diseased. Ascites is a swelling in the couering of the belly, called of the Physitians, Abdomen comprehending both the skin, the fat, eight muscles, and the filme or panicle cal∣led Peritoneum, through the aboundance of some whayish humor entred into the same, which besides the causes before alledged, proceedeth most chiefely by means that some of the vessels within be broken or rather cracked, out of the which, though the blood be∣ing somewhat grosse cannot yssue forth▪ yet the whayish humor being subtil, may run out into the belly, like water distilling through a cracked pot. Timpanias called of vs commonly the Timpany, is a swelling of the aforesaid couering of the belly, through the aboundance of wind entred into the same, which wind is ingende∣red of crudity and euill digestion, and whilest it aboundeth in the stomach, or other intrals finding no yssue out, it breaketh in violently through the smal cundits among the panicles of the aforesaid couering, not without great paine to the patient, and so by tossing to and fro, windeth at length into the space of the couering it selfe. But surely such wind cannot be altogether void of moisture. Notwithstanding, the body swelleth not so much with this kinde of dropsie as with the o∣ther kind called Ascites. The signs of the dropsie is shortnes of breath, swelling of the bo∣dy, euil colour, lothing of meat, and great desire to drinke, especially in the dropsie called Ascites, in which also the belly wil sound like a bottle halfe ful of water: but in the Timpanie it wil sound like a Tabar. But now though mine authors make not so many kinds of drop∣sies, yet they say al generally, that a horse is much subiect to the dropsie. The signs accor∣ding to Absirtus and Hierocles, be these. His belly, legs, and stones, wil be swollen, but his back, buttocks, and flanks, wil be dryed and shrunke vp to the very bones. Moreouer, the vaines of his face and temples, and also the vaines vnder his tong wil be so hidden, as you cannot see them, and if you thrust your finger hard against his body, you shal leaue the print therof behind, for the flesh lacking natural heat wil not returne again to his place, and when the horselyeth down he spreadeth himselfe abroad, not being able to he round together on his belly, and the haire of his back by rubbing wil fal away. Pela∣gonius in shewing the signs of the dropsie, not much differing from the Physitians first re∣cited, seemeth to make two kinds therof, calling the one the Timpany, which for difference sake may be called in English the wind dropsie, and the other the water dropsie. Notwith∣standing both haue one cure, so farre as I can perceiue, which is in this sort. Let him bee warme couered, and walked a good while together in the sun to prouoke sweat, and let all his body be wel and often rubbed alongst the haire, & let him seed vpon Colworts, smal∣l ge, and Elming boughs, and of al other thinges that may loosen the belly, or prouoke vrin, and let his common meat be grasse if it may be gotten, if not, then hay sprinkled with water and Nytrum. It is good also to giue him a kinde of pulse called Cich, steeped a day and a night in water, and then taken out, and laid so as the water may drop away from it. Pelagonius would haue him to drink Parsly stampt with wine, or the root of the herb called Latin Panax, with wine. But if the swelling of the belly wil not decrease for al this, then slit a litle hole vnder his belly a handful behind the nauil, & put into that hole a hollow reed or ome other pipe, that the water or wind may go out, not al at once, but by litle and little at diuers times, and beware that you make not the hole ouer wide, least the caule of the bel∣ly fal downe thereunto, and when al the water is cleane run out, then heale vp the wound as you do al other wounds, and let the horse drinke as little as is possible. Of the euill habit of the stomacke. IF your horse either by inward sicknes, or by present surfet, grow to a loath of his meate, Markham. or by weakenesse of his stomak cast vp his meat and drinke, this shall be the cure for the same: first, in all the drinke he drinks, let him haue the powder of hot spices, as namely of Ginger Annis-seeds, Lycoras, Sinamon, and Pepper, then blow vp into his Nostrils the powder of Tobacco to occasion him to neese, instantly after he hath eaten any meat, for an houre together after, let one stand by him, and hold at his Nose a piece of sower Leuen steept in vineger, then annoint all his breast ouer with the Oyle of Ginnuper and Pepper mixt together. Of the diseases of the guts of a Horse, and first of the Colike. THe guttes of a Horse may be diseased with diuers griefes as with the Collick, Blundevile with costiuenesse, with the Lax, with the bloody-flixe and wormes. The collick is a gree∣uous paine in the great gut, called of the Physitians Colon, whereof this disease ta∣keth his name, which gut, because it is very large and ample, and ful of corners, it is apt to receiue diuers matters, and so becommeth subiect to diuers griefes. For somtime it is tor∣mented with the aboundance of grosse humors gotten betwixt the panicle of the said gut, and sometime with winde hauing no yssue out, sometime with inflamation, and sometime with sharp fretting humors. But so far as I can learn, a horse is most commonly troubled with the colike that commeth of wind, and therefore our Ferrers do tearm it the wind co∣like. The signes whereof be these. The Horse will forsake his meat, and lie downe and wal∣low and walter vpon the ground, and standing on his feet he will stamp for very paine with his fore-feet, and strike on his belly with his hinder foot and looke often towards his belly, which also towards the flanks wil swell, and seeme greater to the eie then it was wont to be. The cure wherof according to Martin, is in this sort: take a quart of Malmesie, of cloues, pepper, Sinamon, of each halfe an ounce, of Sugar halfe a quarterne, and giue it the horse lukewarme, and annoint his flanks with oyle of Bay, and then bridle him and trot him im∣mediately vp and downe the space of an houre, vntil he dung, and if he will not dung then rake him, and if neede be prouoke him to dung, by putting into his fundament an onyon pilled and iagged with a knife crosse-wise, so as the iuyce thereof may tickle his funda∣ment, and for the space of three or foure daies let him drinke no cold water, and let him be kept warm. Russius was wont to vse this kind of cure: take a good big reede a span long or more, and being annointed with oyle, thrust it into the horses fundament, fastning the outward end therof vnto his taile, so as it cannot slip out, and then hauing first annointed & chafed al the horses belly with some hot oyle, cause him to be ridden hastily vp & down some hilly ground, and that will make him to voide the winde out of his belly through the reed: which done, let him be kept warm and fed with good prouender, and warm mashes made of wheat meale, and fennell seed, and let him drink no cold water vntil he be whole. Absirtus would haue you to giue him a glister made of wilde Cucumber, or else of hens dung, Nitrum, and strong wine. Of Costiuenesse, or belly-bound. COstiuenesse is when a horse is bound in the belly and cannot dung, which may come by glut of prouender, or ouermuch feeding and rest, whereof we haue talked suffici∣ent before, also by wind, grosse humors, or cold causing obstruction, and stopping in the guts. The cure whereof, according to Martin, is in this sort. Take of the decoction of Mallowes a quarte, and put thereunto halfe a pinte of Oyle, or in stead thereof, halfe a pinte of fresh Butter, and one ounce of Benedicte laxatiue, and poure that into his fun∣dament with a little Horne meete for the purpose, that doone, clappe his taile to his fundament, holding it still with your hand, whilest another doth leade him in his hand, and trot him vp and downe, Blundevile that the medicine may worke the better, and hauing voyded all that in his belly, bring him vnto the stable, and there let him stand a while on the bitte wel couered, and warme littered, and then giue him a little hay, and let his drinke be war∣med, it shall not be amisse also to giue him that night a warme mash. Of the Laxe. THe Italians call this disease Ragiatura, and the Horse that hath this disease Cauallo Arragiato, or Sforato. It may come through the aboundance of cholerike humors discending from the Liuer or gall, downe to the guts. But Russius saith, that it com∣meth most commonly by drinking ouermuch colde water immediately after prouender, or by sudden trauelling vpon a ful stomach, before his meat be dygested, or by hasty run∣ning, or galloping immediately after water. If this disease continue long, it wil make the Horse very weake and feeble, so as he shall not be able to stand on his legs. Notwithstan∣ding, sith nature feeling her selfe oppressed, endeuoureth thus to ease her selfe by expel∣ling those humors that grieue her, I wold not wish you suddenly to stop it, least som worse inconuenience grow thereof. But if you see that the Horse looseth his flesh, and waxeth more dul and feeble then he was wont to be, then giue him this drinke often experimen∣ted by Martin, and that shal stop him: take of beane-flower, and of bole Armony of each a quarterne, mingle these things together in a quart of red wine, and giue it him lukwarm, and let him rest and be kept warme, and let him drinke no cold drinke but lukewarm, and put therein a little beane flower, and let him not drinke but once a day, and then not ouer much for the spece of three or foure daies. Of the bloody-flixe. IT seemeth by the old writers, that a horse is also subiect to the bloody Flixe. For Absir∣tus, Hierocles, and Democritus, say all with one voice, that the guts of a horse may be so exulcerated, that he wil voide bloody matter at his fundament: yea, and his fundament therwith will fal out, which disease they cal Disenteria, which is is as much to say, as a pain∣ful exulceration of the guts, vnder the which, the old men as it seemeth by the wordes of Hierocles, and Absirtus, would comprehend the disease called of the Physitians Tenasmus, that is to say, a desire to dung often, and to do but little, and that with great paine: And also another disease called Procidentia ani, that is to say, the falling out of the fundament, which the Physitians do account as seueral diseases. Notwithstanding, for somuch as Dy∣senteria, and Tenasmus, do spring both of like causes: yea, and also for that the falling out of the fundament hath some affinity with them, I wil follow mine Authors, in ioyning them altogether in this one chapter. The Physitians make diuers kindes of bloody-flixe, for sometime the fat of the slimy filth which is voided, is sprinkled with a little blood, sometime the matter that voydeth is mixt with the scraping of the guts, and sometime it is waterish bloode, like water wherein flesh hath beene washed, and sometime blood mixt with melancholy, and sometime pure blood, and by the mixture of the matter you shall know in mans body, whether the vlce∣ration be in the inner smal guts or no, if it bee the matter and blood wil be perfectly mixt togither, but if it be in the outward guts, then they be not mingled together, but come out seuerall, the blood most commonly following the matter. Of this kind is that disease called before Tenasmus, for that is an vlcer in the right gut seruing the fundament and doth pro∣ceede euen as the Flixe doth of some sharpe humors, which being violently driuen, and hauing to passe through many crooked and narrow waies, do cleaue to the guts, and with their sharpenesse fret them, causing exulceration and grieuous paine. The flixe also may come of some extreame cold, heat or moistnesse, or by meane of receiuing some violent purgation, hauing therein ouer much Scamony, or such like violent simple, or through weakenesse of the Liuer, or other members seruing to digestion. Now as touching the fal∣ling out of the fundament, the Physitians say, that it commeth through the resolution or weakenesse of the muscles, seruing to draw vp the fundament, which resolution may come partly by ouer-much straining, and partly they may be loosened by ouermuch moisture, for which cause children being ful of moisture are more subiect to this disease then men. And for the selfe same cause I thinke that Horsses hauing very moyst bodyes be subiect thereunto. Thus hauing shewed you the causes of the diseases before recited, I wil shew you the cure prescribed by the old writers. Absirtus would haue the fundament on the outside to be cut round about, but so as the inward ringe thereof be not touched, for that were dangerous and would kil the horse, for so much as his fundament would neuer abide within his body, and that done, he would haue you to giue him to drinke the powder of vnripe Pomgranat shels, called in Latine Malicorium, together with wine and water, which indeede because it is astringent is not to be misliked: but as for cutting of the fundament, I assure you I cannot iudge what he should meane thereby, vnlesse it be to widen the fun∣dament, by giuing it long slits or cuts on the outside, but well I know that it may cause more paine, and greater inflamation. And therefore methinkes it were better in this case to follow the Physitians precepts, which is first to consider whether the fundament being fallen out bee inflamed or not, for if it bee not inflamed, then it shall bee good to an∣noynt it first with Oyle of Roses somewhat warmed, or else to wash it with warme red wine. But if it be inflamed, then to bath it wel, first with a spunge dipt in the decoction of Mal∣lowes, Camomile, Lineseede and Fenegreek, and also to annoint it wel with oyle of Ca∣momile and Dill mingled together, to asswage the swelling, and then to thrust it in againe faire and softly, with a soft linnen cloth. That done, it shall be good to bathe all the place about with red wine wherein hath beene sodden Acatium, Galles, A corne cups, parings of Quinces, and such like simples as be astringent, and then to throw on some astringent powder made of bole Armony, Frankincens, Sanguis Draconis, Myrrh, Acatium, and such like: yea, and also to giue the Horsse this drinke much praised of all the old writers. Take of Saffron one ounce, of Myrrh two ounces, of the hearb called in Latine Abrotonum, na∣med in some of our English herbals Sothernwood, three ounces, of Parsly one ounce, of garden Rue, otherwise called herb Grace three ounces, of Piritheum, otherwise called of some people spittlewort, and of Isope of each two ounces, of Cassia which is like Cyna∣mon, one ounce. Let al these things be beaten in fine powder & then mingled with chalk and strong vineger wrought into paast, of which paast make little cakes, and dry them in the shadow, and being dryed, dissolue some of them in a sufficient quantity of barly milk, or iuyce called of the old writers, and also of the Physitians, Cremor Ptisane, and giue to the Horse to drinke thereof with a horne, for the medicine, as the Authors write, doth not onely heale the bloody-flixe and the other two diseases before recited, but also if it be gi∣uen with a quart of warme water it will heale al griefe and pain in the belly, and also of the bladder, that commeth for lacke of staling. And being giuen with sweete wine it will heale the biting of any Serpent or mad dog. Of the Wormes. IN a Horsses guts do breed three kindes of wormes, euen as there doth in mans body, Blundevile though they be not altogether like in shape. The first long and round, euen like to those that children do most commonly voyde, and are called by the generall name wormes. The second little worms hauing great heads and small long tailes like a needle, and be cal∣led Bots. The 3. be short and thick like the end of a mans little finger, and therefore be cald Troncheons: and though they haue diuers shapes according to the diuersity of the place perhaps where they breed, or else according to the figure of the putrified matter whereby they breede: yet no doubt they proceede all of one cause, that is to say, of a raw, grosse and flegmatike matter apt to putryfaction, ingendred most commonly by foule feeding, and as they proceede of one selfe cause, so also haue they like signes, and like cure. The usignes be these. The Horse wil forsake his meate, for the Troncheons and the Bots wil co∣uet alwaies to the maw and paine him sore. He will also lye downe and wallow, and stan∣ding he will stamp and strike at his belly with his hinder foote, and looke often toward his belly. The cure according to Martin is thus: take of sweet milke a quart, of hony a quarterne, and giue it him lukewarme, and walke him vppe and downe for the space of an houre, and so let him rest for that day, with as little meate or drinke as may bee, and suffer him not to lye downe. Then the next day giue him this drinke: take of berbe Grace a handful, of Sauin as much, and being wel stampt, put therunto a little Brimstone, and a little foote of a Chimny, beaten into fine powder, and put all these things together in a quart of wort or Ale, and there let them lye in steepe the space of an houre or two, then straine it well through a faire cloath, and giue it the Horsse to drinke lukewarme, then bridle him and walke him vp and downe the space of an houre: that done bring him into the stable, and let him stand on the bit two or three houres, and then giue him a little Hay. Laurentius Russius saith, that it is good to giue the Horse the warme guts of a young hen with a salt three daies together in the morning, and not to let him drinke vntill it bee noone. Some say that it is good to ride him hauing his bit first annointed with dung comming hot from the man: some againe vse to giue him a quantity of Brimstone, and halfe as much Rozen beaten into powder and mingled together with his prouender, which he must eate a good while before he drinketh. I haue found by often triall, that if you giue the horse with a horne a good pretty dish∣full of salt brine, be it flesh brine or cheese brine, it wil kil any of the three kinds of worms, and make the horse to auoide them dead in short time after. Of Wormes in generall. B Esides the Bottes, there are other Worms, which lie in the great paunch or belly of a Horse, and they bee shining, of colour like a Snake, sixe inches in length, Markham. great in the midst and sharpe at both endes, and as much as a spindle: they cause great paine in a Horsses belly, as you shall perceiue by his continu∣all striking of himselfe on the belly with his foot, the cure is thus: Giue him two or three mornings together new Milke and Garlike boyled together, or chopt hay in his prouen∣der either of both will serue: it killeth the wormes and maketh them to void. Of the paine in the kidneynes. M Ethinkes that the Kidnies of a Horse should be subiect to as many griefes as the kidnies of a man, as to inflamation, obstruction, Apostumes and Vlcers, Blundevile and specially to obstruction that commeth by meanes of some stone or grauell gathered together in the kidnies, whereby the Horse can∣not stale but with paine, for I haue seene diuers horsses my selfe that haue voided much grauell in their stale, which without doubt did come from the kidnies, but my Authors doe referre such griefes to the bladder and vrine, and write of no disease but onely of the inflamation of the kidnies, which is called of them Nephritis, and so it is cald of the Physitians. It commeth as they say by some great straine ouer some ditch, or else by bearing some great burthen. The signes whereof be these. The Horse will go rolling behinde and staggering, his stones will shrinke vp, and his stale will be blackish and thick. I think this disease differeth not from that which we called before the swaying of the back when we talked of the griefes in the backe and loines, and therefore resorte thither. The cure of this disease, according to the best of the old writers is in this sort. Bath his backe and loines with wine, Oyle, and Nitrum warmed together, after that you haue so bathed him, let him be couered with warme cloathes, and stand littered vp to the belly with straw, so as he may lye softe, and giue him such drinkes as may prouoke Vrine, as those that bee made with Dill, Fennell, Annis, Smallage, Parsly, Spikenard, Myrrhe and Cassia. Some say it is good to giue him a kind of pulse called Cich with Wine. Some againe doe praise Ewes Milke or else Oyle and Deeres sewet molten together and giuen him to drink, or the roote of the herbe called Asphodelus, Englished by some Daffadill, sodden in wine. Of the diseases belonging to the bladder and vrine of a Horse. HIerocles saith, that a horse is subiect to three kinds of diseases incident to the blad∣der or vrine, the firste is called Stranguria, the second Dysuria, the third Iscuria. Stranguria, otherwise called in Latine Stillicidium, and of our old Ferrers, accor∣ding to the French name Chowdepis, is when the horse is prouoked to stale often, and voideth nothing but a few droppes, which commeth as the physitians say, either through the sharpenes of the vrine, or by some exulceration of the bladder, or else by meanes of some Apostume in the liuer or kidnies, which Apostume being broken, the matter resor∣teth downe into the bladder, and with the sharpenes thereof causeth a continuall prouo∣cation of pissing. Dysuria is when a horse cannot pisse but with great labour and paine, which for diffe∣rence sake I wil cal from hence forth the paine-pisse. It may come sometime through the weakenesse of the bladder and colde intemperature thereof, and sometime through the abundance of flegmatike and grosse humours, stopping the necke of the bladder. Ischu∣ria, is when the horsse cannot pisse at all, and therefore may be called the pissupprest, or suppresseion of vrine, whether you will: methinkes alwaies that the shorter and the more proper the name is, the better and more easie it is to pronounce. It may come as the Phisitians say, by weaknesse of the bladder, or for that the Water conduit is stopt with grosse humors, or with matter discending from the liuer or kidnies, or with the stone: yea and sometimes by meanes of some inflammation or hard knobbe growing at the mouth of the conduit, or for that the sinnewes of the bladder is nummed, so as the bladder is without feeling: or it may come by retention, and long holding of the water, most of which causes Hierocles also reciteth, adding thereunto that it may chaunce to a horse thorough ouer-much rest and ydlenes, and also by meanes of some extreame cold, and especially in winter season, for the which warmth of the fire is a present reme∣dy. But now mine Authors do not shew for euery one of these three kinds of diseases se∣uerall signes, but onely say, that when a horse cannot stale, he wil stand as thogh he would stale, and thrust out his yard a little, and also for very paine, stand beating his tail betwixt his thighes. Neither do they seeme to appoint seuerall cures, but do make a hochpoch, mingling them altogither, some of them praising one thing and some another: For some say it is good to mingle the iuice of leekes with sweete smelling wine and oile together, and to his right nostrill, and then to walke him vp and downe vpon it, and that will make him to stale. Some say it is good to giue him Swallage seed, or else the root of wilde Fennell sod∣den with wine to drinke, or to put fine sharpe Onions, cleane pilled, and somewhat bru∣sed into his fundament, and to chafe him immediately vppon it, either by riding him or otherwise, and that shall cause him to stale presently. It is good also to bath al his back and loines with warme water. The scraping of the inward parts of his owne hooues beaten into powder and mingled with wine and powred into his right nostril will make him to stale, if you chafe him vpon it, and the rather as Hierocles saith, if you carry him to some sheepes coat or other place where sheepe are wont to stand, the smel of whose dung and pisse, without any other me∣dicine as he saith, will prouoke him to stale, Some will giue the horsse white Dogges dung dried and mingled with salt, wine, and Amoniacum to drinke, some hogges dunge onely with Wine, and some the dregges of horse-pisse with wine, and many other medicines which I leaue to rehearse for feare of being too tedious, and especially, sith Martins experience doeth follow heere at hand, a∣greeing in all points with Laurentius Russius cure, which is in this sort. First draw out his yard and wash it well in white wine, and scoure it well, because it will be many times stop∣ped with durt and other baggage togither, and hardned like a stone, and then put a little oile of Cammomile into the conduit with a wax candle and a brused cloue of Garlick, and that will prouoke him to stale. And if that will not helpe. Take of Parsly two handfuls, of Coriander one handfull, stampe them and straine them with a quart of white wine, and dissolue therein one ounce of cake-Sope, and giue it luke warme vnto the horse to drinke and keepe him as warme as may be, and let him drinke no cold water for the space of fiue or six dayes, and when you would haue him to stale, let it be eyther vpon plenty of strawe, or vpon some greene plot, or els in a sheeps coat, the sauor whereof wil greatly prouoke him to stale, as hath bin aforesaid. Of pissing blood. PElagonius saith, that if a horse be ouermuch laboured, or ouercharged with heauy burthen, or ouer fat, he will many times pisse blood, and the rather as I thinke, for that some vaine is broken within the horses body, and then cleere blood will come forth many times, as the Physitians say, without any pisse at all. But if the blood be per∣fectly mingled togither with his stale, then it is a signe that it commeth from the kidnies hauing some stone therein, which through vehement labour, doeth fret the kidnies and vaines thereof, and so cause them to bleed, through which while the vrine passeth, must needs be infected and died with the blood. It may come also by some stripe, or from the muscle that incloseth the necke of the bladder. The cure, according to Pelagonius, Absir∣tus, Hierocles, and the rest, is thus. Let the horse blood in the palate of the mouth, to con∣uert the blood the contrary way, then take of Tragagant that hath been steeped in wine, halfe an ounce, and of Poppy seede one dram and once scruple, and of Stirax as much, and twelue Pineaple kirnels: let all these things be beaten and mingled wel togither, and giue the horse thereof euery morning, the space of seauen daies, the quantity of a hasell∣nut distempered in a quart of wine: methinkes that the quantity of a Walnut were too little for so much wine. Some write that it is good to make him a drinke with the root of the hearbe Asphopelus, which some call Daffadil mingled with wheat flower and Sumach sodden long in water, and so to bee giuen the horse with some wine added thereunto, or make him a drinke of Goats milk and oile, straining thereunto a little Fromenty. Anato∣lius saith that it good to giue the horse three daies togither, sodden beanes cleane pilled whereunto would be added some Deeres sewet and a little wine. Of the Colt euill. Blundevile THis name Colt euil, in my iudgement, doeth properly signifie that disease, which the physitians cal Priapismus, which is a continual standing together, with an vn∣natural swelling of the yarde proceeding of some winde, filling the artires and hol∣low sinnew or pipe of the yard, or else through the abundance of seed, which do chance oftentimes to man, and I think sometime to stoned horses. Notwithstanding Martin saith that the colt euil is a swelling of the sheathe of the yard and part of the belly thereabout, caused of corrupt seed, comming out of the yard, and remaining within the sheath where it putrifieth. And geldings most commonly are subiect to this disease, not being able for lacke of natural heat, to expel their seed any further. For horses, as Martin saith, are siel∣dome troubled with this disease because of their heat, vnlesse it be when they haue beene ouer trauailed, or otherwise weakened. The cure, according to him, is thus. Wash the sheath cleane within with Luke-warme Vineger, then draw out his yard and wash that al∣so: that done ride him into some running streame vppe to the belly; tossing him therein too and fro to alay the heat of the members, and vse him thus two or three daies and hee shal be whole. Another of the Colt euill. THe Colt euill is a disease that commeth to stoned horses, through rankenes of na∣ture and want of vent, it appeareth in his cod and sheathe, which wil swell excee∣dingly, Markham. the cure is nothing, for if you wil but euery day, twice or thrice driue him to the mid-side in some Pond or running riuer, the swelling will fall and the horse wil doe wel. If the horse be of yeeres, and troubled with this griefe, if you put him to a Mare it is not amisse, for standing stil in a stable without exercise, is a great occasion of this disease. Of the mattering of the yard. IT commeth at couering time, when the horse and mare both are ouer-hot and so per∣haps burne themselues. The cure according to Martin is thus. Take a pinte of white wine, and boile therein a quarterne of roche Alome, and squirt thereof into his yarde three or foure squirtfuls, one after another, and thrust the squirt so far as the liquor may pierce to the bottome, to scowre away the bloody matter, continuing thus to do once a day vntil he be whole. Of the shedding of seed. THis disease is called of the Physitians Gonorrhea, Blundevile which may come sometime tho∣rough aboundance and rankenesse of seed, and sometime by the weakenes of the stones and seed vessels not able to retaine the seed vntill it be digested and thickned. Vegetius saith, that this disease will make the horse very faint and weake, and especially in Summer season, For cure whereof, the said Vegetius would haue the horse to be ridden in∣to some cold water, euen vp to the belly, so as his stones may bee couered in water, and then his fundament being first bathed with warme water and oile, he would haue you to thrust in your hand and arme euen to the very bladder, and softly to rubbe and claw the same, and the parts thereabouts, which be the seed vessels: that done to couer him warm that he take no cold, and euery day he woulde haue you to giue the horse hogges dung to drinke with red wine vntil he be whole. I for my part, if I thought it came of weakenes, as is aforesaide, which I would iudge by the waterishnesse of the seed and vnlustines of the horse, would giue him red wine to drinke, and put therein a little Acatium, the iuyce of Plantaine, and a little Masticke, and bath his backe with redde Wine and oyle of Roses mingled togither. Of the falling of the yard. IT commeth as I take it, through the weakenes of the member, by meanes of some re∣solution in the muscles and sinnewes seruing the same, caused at the first (perhaps) by some great straine or stripe on the backe. It may come also by wearines and tiring. For remedy whereof, Absirtus was wont to wash the yard with salt water from the sea if it may be gotten, and if not with water and salt, and if that preuailed not, he would al to pricke the outmost skinne of the yard with a sharpe needle but not deepe, and then wash all the prickes with strong Vineger, and that did make the horse as he saith, to draw vp his yarde againe immediately: yea, and this also will remedy the falling out of the fundament. Pela∣gonius would haue you to put into the pipe of his yard, hony and salt boiled togither and made liquid, or else a quicke fly, or a graine of Frankencense or a cloue of Garlicke clean pilled, and somewhat brused, and also to powre on his back oile, wine, Nitre made warm and mingled togither. But Martins experience is in this sort. First wash the yarde with warm white wine, and then anoint it with oyl of Roses and hony mingled togither, and put it vp into the sheath, and make him a cod-peece of Canvas to keepe it still vp, and dresse him thus euery day once vntil it be whole. And in any case let his backe be kept warme, ei∣ther with a dubble cloath, or else with a charge made of bole Armonie, Egges, wheate-flower, Sanguis Draconis, Turpentine, and Vineger, or els lay on a wet sacke, which being couered with another dry cloath wil keepe his backe very warme. Of the swelling of the Cod and stones. A Bsirtus saith, that the inflammation and swelling of the cod and stones, commeth by meanes of some wound, or by the stinging of some Ser∣pent, or by fighting one horse with another. For remedy whereof, hee was woont to bath the cod with water wherein hath beene sodden the roots of wilde Cucumber and salt, and then to annoint it with an oint∣ment made of Cerusa oile, Goates greace, and the white of an Egge. Some againe would haue the cod to be bathed in warme Water, Nitrum and Vineger togither, and also to be annointed with an ointment made of chalke, or of potters earth, Oxe dung, cumin, Water and Vineger, or else to be annointed with the iuice of the herb Solanum, called of some night-shade, or with the iuyce of Hemblocke growing on dung∣hils: yea and also to be let bloud in the flankes. But Martin saith, that the swelling of the cods commeth for the most part after some sicknesse or surfetting with colde, and then it is a signe of amendment. The cure according to his experience is in this sort. First let him blood on both sides the flanke veines. Then take of oile of Roses, of Vineger of each halfe a pinte, and halfe a quarterne of Bole Armony beaten to powder. Mingle them togither in a cruse, and being luke-warme, annoint the cods therewith with two or three fea hers bound togither, and the next day ride him into the water so as his coddes may be within the water, giuing him two or three turnes therein, and so returne faire and softly to the stable, and when he is dry annoint him againe as before, continuing thus to do euery day once vntil they be whole. The said Martin saith also, the cods may be swollen by meanes of some hurt or euil humors resorting into the Cod, and then he would haue you couer the cods with a charge made of Bole Armony and Vineger wrought togither, renewing it euery day once vntil the swelling go away, or that it breake of it selfe, and if it breake then taint it with Mel Rosatum, and make him a breech of Canuas to keepe it in, renewing the taint euery day once vntil it be whole. Of incording and brusing. THis terme incording is borrowed of the Italian word Incordato, which in plain En∣glish is as much to say as bursten, Blundevile and might be more rightly tearmed of vs vncod∣ded. For when a horse is bursten, his guts falleth downe into the cod making it to swell. The Italians as I take it did cal it Incordato because the gut followes the string of the stone called of them Ilcordone, or Lachorda, whereof Incordato seemes to be deriued with some reason. According to which reason we should cal it rather instringhed than inchor∣ded, for Chorda doth signifie a string or chord. Notwithstanding, sith that incording is al∣ready receiued in the stable, I for my part am very well content therewith, minding not to contend against it. But now you haue to note, that either man or beast may be bursten di∣uersly, and according to the names of the partes greeued, the Physitians doe giue it di∣uers names: for you shall vnderstande, that next vnto the thicke outward skinne of the belly, there is also another inward thin skin couering al the muscles, the Caule, and the guts of the belly, called of the Anatomists Peritoneum, which skin commeth from both partes and sides of the backe, and is fastened to the midriffe aboue, and also to the bot∣tome of the belly beneath, to keepe in al the contents of the neather belly. And therefore if the skin be broken, or ouer sore strained or stretched, then either some part of the caule or guts slippeth downe, sometime into the cod, sometime not so farre. If the gut slip downe into the cod, then it is called of the Physitians by the Greek name Enterocele, that is to say, gut-bursten. But if the caule fall downe into the cod, then it is called of the Physitians Epiplocele, that is to say, Caule-bursten. But either of the diseases is most properlie incident to the male kind, for the femal kind hath no cod. Notwithstan∣ding they may be so bursten, as either gut or caule may fal downe into their natures, han¦ging there like a bag: But if it fal not downe so lowe, but remaineth aboue nigh vnto the priuy members or flankes, which place is called of the Latines Inguen, then of that place the bursting is called of the physitians Bubonocele, whereunto I knowe not what English name to giue, vnlesse I should cal it flanke-bursten: Moreouer the cod or flanke may bee sometime swollen, by meanes of some waterish humour gathered together in the same, which is called of the physitians Hydrocele, that is to say, water-bursten, and sometime the cod may be swollen by meanes of some hard peece of flesh cleauing to the thin skins or panicles of the stones, and then it is called of the physitians Sarcocele, that is to say, flesh-bursten. But forasmuch as none of mine Authors, Martin nor anie other Ferrer in these daies that I knowe, haue intermedled with anie kind of bursting, but onely with that wherein the gut falleth downe into the cod: leauing all the rest apart, I wil onely talke of this; and that according to Martins experience, which I assure you differeth not much from the precepts of the old writers: But first you shal vnderstand, that the gut bursten, and flanke bursten, doth proceed both of one cause, that is to say, by meanes that the skinne, called before Peritoneum, is either sore strained, or else broken, either by some stripe of another horse, or els by some strain in leaping ouer an hedge, ditch, or pale, or otherwise: yea and many times in passing a carier, through the carelesnes of the rider stoping the horse so∣denly without giuing warning, wherby the horse is forced to cast his hinder legs abroad, so straineth or bursteth the skin aforesaid, by meanes whereof the gut falleth downe into the cod. The signes be these. The horse will forsake his meat, and stand shoring and lean∣ning alwaies on that side that he is hurt: and on that side, if you search with your hande, betwixt the stone and the thigh vpward to the body, and somewhat aboue the stone you shall find the gut it selfe big and hard in the feeling, whereas on the other side you shal find no such thing. The cure according to Martin is thus. Bring the horse into some house or place that hath ouer head a strong balk or beame going ouerthwart, and strew that place thicke with strawe: then put on foure pasternes with foure ringes on his feete, and then fasten the one end of a long rope to one of those Ringes, then thread all the other rings with the loose end of the Rope, and so drawe all his foure feete togither, and cast him on the straw. That done, cast the rope ouer the baulke, and hoise the horse so as he may lye flatte on his backe, with his legs vpward without struggling. Then bath his stones well with warme Water and Butter molten togither, and the stones being somewhat warme, and wel mol∣lified, raise them vp from the body with both your hands being closed by the fingers fast togither, and holding the stones in your hands in such manner, worke downe the gut in∣to the body of the horse, by striking it downward continually with your two thumbs, one labouring immediately after another, vntill you perceiue that side of the stone to bee so so smal as the other, and hauing so discorded, that is to say, returnd the gut into his right place; take a list of two fingers broad throughly annointed with fresh butter, and tie his stones both togither with the same so nigh as may bee, not ouer hard, but so as you may put your finger betwixt. That done, take the horse quietly down, and lead him faire and softly into the stable, whereas he must stand warme, and not be stirred for the space of 3. weekes. But forget not the next day after his discording to vnloosen the list and to take it away, and as wel at that time as euery day once or twice after, to cast a dish or two of cold water vp into his cods and that wil cause him to shrinke vppe his stones and thereby re∣straine the gut from falling downe, and at the three weekes end be sure, it were not amisse to geld the stone on that side away, so shall he neuer be encorded againe on that side. But let him not eat much nor drinke much, and let his drinke be alwayes warme. Of the botch in the graines of a horse▪ IF a horse be full of humours and then suddenly laboured, the humours will resort into the weakest parts, and there gather together and breede a botch, and especially in the hinder parts betwixt the thighes, not farre from the cods. The signes be these. The hin∣der legges wil be al swollen, and especially from the houghes vpwarde, and if you feele with your hand you shal find a great kind of swelling, and if it be round and hard it wil ga∣ther to a head. The cure according to Martin is thus. First ripe it with a plaister: take of Wheat-flower, of Turpentine, and of hony, of each like quantity, stirring it together to make a stiffe plaister, and with a cloth lay it vnto the sore, renewing it euery day once vn∣til it breake or waxe soft, and then launce it as the matter may runne downeward: Then taint it with Turpentine and Hogges greace moulten togither, renewing it euery daye once, vntil it be whole. Of the diseases incident to the wombe of a Mare, and specially of barrennesse. IT seemeth by some writers, that the wombe of a Mare is subiect to certaine diseases, though not so many as the wombe of a Woman, as to ascent, descent, falling out, convulsion, barrennesse, aborsment, yea Aristotle and others do not let to write, that menstrual blood doth naturally void from the Mare, as from the Woman, though it bee so little in quantity, as it cannot be well perceiued. But sith none of mine Authors haue written thereof to any purpose, nor any Ferrer of this time that I knowe, haue had any experience in such matters I wil passe them all ouer with silence, sauing barrennes, where∣of I promised before in his due place, to declare vnto you the causes and such kind of cure for the same, as the old writers haue taught. A Mare then may be barren through the vn∣temperatenesse of the wombe or matrix, aswell for that it is too hot and fiery, or else to cold and moist, or too dry, or else too short, or too narrow, or hauing the necke thereof turned awry, or by meanes of some obstruction or stopping in the matrix, or for that the mare is too fat or too leane, and many times mares goe barren, for that they be not well horsed. Wel, the cure of barrennesse that commeth through the fault of the matrixe or wombe according to the old writers is thus. Take a good handful of Leekes, stamp them in a morter with halfe a glasseful of wine, then put thereunto twelue Flies, called of the Apothecaries Cantharides, of diuers colours, if they may be gotten, then straine altoge∣ther with a sufficient quantity of water to serue the mare therewith two daies together, by powring the same into her nature with a horn or glister-pipe made of purpose, and at the end of three daies next following offer the horse vnto her that should couer her, and immediately after that she is couered, wash her nature twice together with cold water. Another receipt for the same purpose. TAke of Nitrum, of sparrowes dung, and Turpentine, of each a like quantitye well wrought together and made like a suppository, and put that into her nature, and it wil cause her to desire the horse and also to conceiue. Hippocrates saith, that it is good also to put a nettle into the horses mouth that should couer her. Of the Itch, Scabbe, and manginesse in the taile, and falling of the taile. Blundevile I N springtime horses many times are trobled with the troncheons in their fun¦dament, and then they wil rubbe their taile, and breake the haire thereof, and yet in his taile perhaps, shal be neither itch, scurffe nor scabbe: wherefore if you rake the horse wel with your hand annointed with Sope, and search for those tronchens and pul them cleane out, you shal cause him to leaue rubbing: and if you see that the haire doe fal awaie it felfe, then it is a signe, that it is either eaten with wormes, or that there is some scurffe or scab fretting the hair, and causing such an itch in his taile as the horse is alwaies rubbing the same. As touching the wormes, scurffe or scab, it shalbe good to annoint all the taile with sope, and then to wash it cleane euen to the ground with stronge lie, and that wil kil the wormes, and make the haire to growe a∣gaine. And if much of the taile be worne awaie, it shall bee needefull to keepe the taile continually wet, with a spunge dipt in faire water, and that will make the haire to growe very fast. But if the horses taile be maungy, then heale that like as you do the manginesse of the maine before rehearsed. Againe, if there breed any Canker in the taile (which wil consume both flesh and bone, and as Laurentius Russius saith, make the ioyntes to fall a∣way one by one) it shall be good as Martin saith, to wash all his taile with Aquafortis, or strong water made in this sort: take of greene Coporas, of Alum, of each one pounde, of white coporas, a quarterne. Boile al these things togither in three quartes of runninge water in a strong earthen pot, vntil one halfe be consumed, and then with a little of this water being made luke-warme, wash his taile with a little clout, or Flax bound to the end of a sticke, continuing so to do euery day once vntil it be whole. Of the Scabbe. THe Scab is a foule scurffe in diuers parts of a horses body, & commeth of pouerty or il keeping, or many times by going amongst woodes wherein they are infected with water boughes: it is most incident to olde horses, which wil die thereof, and chiefely in the spring time when the newe blood appeares: the cure whereof I haue spo∣ken before. How to know when a horse halteth before in what part his griefe is. Being now come to talke of the griefes in the shoulders, legs, hips, houghes, ioyntes, and hooues, causing the horse most commonly to halt: I thinke it good first to shew you the way how to find in what part of his legs the horse is grieued when he halteth either be∣fore or behind. And first you haue to consider that if a horse halteth before, it must be ey∣ther in his shoulders, in his legs, or in his feet. If it be in his shoulders and new hurt, the horse wil not lift that leg, but traile it nigh the ground. If it be old hurt, he wil cast that Leg further from him in his going then the other, and if he be turned on the foreside, then he wil halt so much the more. If a horse halteth in the leg, it is either in the knee, in the shank, or els in the pastern ioynt, if it be either in the knee, or pastern ioynt, he will not bow that leg in his going like the other, but go very stifly vpon it. If he halteth in the shank, then it is by means of some splent, wind-gal, or such apparant griefe, apt to be seen or felt. If he halt in the foot, it is either in the cronet, heele, in the toe, in the quarters, or sole of the foot. If it be in the cronet the griefe wil be apparant, the skin being broken or swolen some man∣ner of way: if in the heele, as by ouerreach or otherwise, then he wil tread most on the toe: if vpon any of the quarters, then going on the edge of a bank or hilly ground, he will halt more then on the plain ground, and by the horses comming toward you, and going from you vpon such edge or banck, you shall easily perceiue whether his griefe be in the inward quarter or in the outward quarter: the quarter is to be vnderstood, from the mid-hooue to the heele. If he halt in the toe, which is not commonly seen, then he wil tred more vpon the heele. If the griefe be in the sole of his foot, then he wil halt al after one sort vpon any ground, vn∣lesse it be vpon the stones. And to be sure in what part of the foote the griefe is, it shall be good first to make him go vpon the plain ground, and then vpon a hard & stony ground: yea, and also a banky ground. Thus hauing declared vnto you in generall, how to know in what part a horse is grieued when he halteth before: I thinke it meete first to shew you or∣derly all the particular griefes and sorances, whereunto the fore-parts of a horse is subiect, together with the causes, signs and cure thereof. That done, I will speak of halting behind, and shew you first generally where the griefe is, and then particulary declare vnto you e∣uery griefe incident to the hinder parts of a horse. And lastly, I will speake of such griefes and sorances as are commonly in both parts, that is to say, as wel to the forelegs and fore-feet, as to the hinder legs and hinder feet. Of the griefe and pinching in the shoulder. THis commeth either by laboring and straining the Horse too young, or else by some great burthen; you shal perceiue it by the narrownes of the brest, and by consuming flesh of the shoulders, insomuch as the forepart of the shoulder bone wil sticke out, and be a great deal higher then the flesh. And if it be of long continuance, he wil be very hollow in the brisket towards the armeholes, and he wil go wider beneath at the feet, then aboue at the knees. The cure according to Martin is thus. Giue him a slit of an inch long with a sharp knife or rasor vpon both sides an inch vnder the shoulder bones: then with a Swans quil put into the slit, blow vp first the one shoulder and then the other, as big as can possi∣ble, euen vp to the withers, & with your hand strike the winde equally into euery place of the shoulders. And when they be both ful, then beat al the windy places with a good ha∣sel wand or with both your hands, clapping vpon the places puffed vp with wind, so fast as they can walke one after another ouer al the shoulder: then with a flat slice of iron, loosen the skin within from the flesh: that done, rowel the two slits or cuts with two round rowels made of the vpper leather of an old shoo, with a hole in the middest that the matter may yssue forth, and let such rowles be 3. inches broad, and so put in as they may lie plain and flat within the cut: then make a charge to lay vpon the same in this sort. Take of Pitch, and rosen, of each one pound, of tar halfe a pinte, boile these things alto∣gether in a pot, and when it is somwhat cooled, take a sticke with a wollen clout bound fast to the end thereof, and dip it into this charge, and couer or daube al the shoulder there∣with. That done, clap thereunto a pounde of Floxe of such colour as the Horse is, or as nigh vnto the same as may be, euery other day clense both the woundes and rowels, and put them in againe, continuing thus to do the space of fifteene daies. Then take them out, and heale vp the wounds with two taints of Flax dipt in Turpentine, and hogs grease molten together, renewing the same euery day once, vntil the wounds be whole. But let the charge lye stil, vntill it fal away of it selfe, and let the horse run to grasse, vntill he hath had a frost or two. Of the wrinching of the shoulder. THis commeth sometime by a fal, and sometime by turning too suddenly in some in euen ground, or by rash running out of some doore, or by some stripe of another horse, or by some sudden stop in passing a Cariere: you shal perceiue it in his going by trailing his legs vpon the ground, so close vnto himselfe as hee can possible. The cure, according to Martin is thus. Let him blood the quantity of three pintes, on the breast in the palat vaine, receiuing the blood in a pot, and thereunto put first a quart of strong vi∣neger, and halfe a doozen broken egges, shelles and all, and so much wheat-flower as will thicken all that liquor. That done, put thereunto bole Armony beaten into fine powder one pounde, Sanguis Draconis two ounces, and mingle them altogether, so as the flower may not be perceiued, and if it be too stiffe, you may make it more liquid or soft, with a little vineger. Then with your hand daube al the shoulder from the mane downward, and betwixt the fore-bowels all against the haire, and let not the horse depart out of that place, vntill the charge be surely fastned vnto the skin. That done, carry him into the stable, and tie him vp to the racke, and suffer him not to lie down al that day, and giue him a little meat, dieting him moderatly the space of fifteen daies: during which time, he may not stir out of his place, but onely to lye downe, and e∣uery day once refresh the shoulder point with this charge, laying still new vpon the olde, and at the fifteene daies end, lead him abroad to see how he goeth, and if he be somewhat amended, then let him rest without trauelling, the space of one month, and that shal bring his shoulder to perfection. But if he be neuer the better for this that is done, than it shal be needeful to rowell him with a leather rowell vpon the shoulder point, and to keepe him rowelled the space of fifteene daies, renewing the rowel, and clensing the wound euery o∣ther day, and then walke him vp and downe faire and softly, and turne him alwaies on the contrary side to the sore, and when hee goeth vpright, pul out the rowell and heale the wound with a taint of flax dipt in Turpentine, and hogs greace molten together. And if al this will not serue, then it shal be needful to draw him checker wise with a hot iron ouer all the shoulder point, and also make him to draw in a plough euery day two houres at the least, to settle his ioynts for the space of three weekes or a month, and if any thing wil help him, these two last remedies wil help him, and make him to go vpright againe. Of splaiting in the shoulder. THis commeth by some dangerous sliding or slipping, wherby the shoulder parteth from the breast, and so leaues an open rift, not in the skin, but in the flesh and filme next vnder the skin, and so he halteth & is not able to goe, you shal perceiue it by trailing his legge after him in his going. The cure according to Martin is thus. First put a paire of strait pasternes on his fore-feet, keeping him stil in the stable without disquieting him. Then take of Dialthea one pound, of sallet-oyle one pinte, of oyle de bayes halfe a pound, of fresh butter halfe a pound, melt al these things together in a pipkin, and annoint the grieued place therwith, and also round about the inside of the shoulder, and within two or three daies after, both that place and all the shoulder besides wil swel. Then either prick him with a lancet or fleame, in al the swelling places, or else with some other sharp hot iron, the head whereof would be an inch long, to the intent that the cor∣ruption may run out, and vse to annoint it stil with the same ointment. But if you see that it wil not go away but swel stil, and gather to a head, then lance it where the swelling doth ga∣ther most, and is soft vnder the finger, & then taint it with flax dipt in this ointment: take of Turpentine and of hogs grease of each two ounces, and melt them together, renewing the taint twice a day vntil it be whole. Of the shoulder pight. THis is when the shoulder point or pitch of the shoulder is displased, Blundevile which griefe is called of the Italians Spallato, and it commeth by reason of some great fal forward rush or straine. The signes be these. That shoulder point wil sticke out further then his fellow, and the Horse will halt right downe. The cure according to Martin is thus. First make him to swim in a deepe water vp and down a doozen turnes, and that shal make the ioynt to re∣turne in his place. Then make two tough pins of ashen wood as much as your little finger, sharp at the points, each one fiue inches long: that done, slit the skin an inch aboue the point, and an inch beneath the point of the shoulder, and thrust in one of the pins from a∣boue downward, so as both ends may equally stick without the skin. And if the pin of wood wil-not easily passe through, you may make it way first with an iron pin. That done, make other two holes crosse to the first holes, so as the other pin may crosse the first pin right in the midst with a right crosse, and the first pin would be somewhat flat in the midest, to the intent that the other being round, may passe the better without stop and close the iuster together. Then take a peece of a little line somwhat bigger then a whipcord, and at one end make a loope, which being put ouer one of the pins ends, wind the rest of the line good & straite about the pins ends, so as it may lye betwixt the pins ends and the skin, and fasten the last end with a pack needle and a pack thread, vnto the rest of the cord, so as it may not slip: and to do well, both the prickes and the cord would be first annointed with a little hogs greace. Then bring him into the stable, and let him rest the space of 9. daies, but let him lye down as little as may be, and put on a pasterne on the sore leg, so as it may be bound with a cord vnto the foot of the manger, to keepe that legge alwaies whilest he standeth in the stable more forward then the other. And at the nine daies end take out the prickes, and annoint the sore places with a litle Dialthea, or with hogs grease, and then turn him out to grasse. Of the swelling of the forelegs after great labor. GReat labor and heat causeth humors to resort down into the legs making them swel, The cure whereof, according to Martin is thus. Bath them with buttered beere or els with this bath here following: take of Mallovves 3. handfuls, a rose cake, Sage one hand∣ful: boile them together in a sufficient quantity of vvater, and vvhen the Mallovves bee soft, put in halfe a pound of butter, and halfe a pinte of Sallet-oile, and then being some∣what vvarme, vvash the svvelling thervvith euery day once, the space of three or 4. daies. And if the swelling wil not go away with this, then take Wine lees, and Cumin, and boile them together, and put thereunto a little wheate-flower, and charge al the swelling there∣with, and walke him often: and if it will not serue, then take vp the great veine aboue the knee on the inside, suffering him not to bleed from aboue, but al from beneath. Of the Foundering in the forelegs. THe cause of this griefe is declared before in the Chapter of foundering in the body, whereas I shewed you, that if a horse be foundred in the body, the humors wil imme∣diatly resort downe into his legs, as Martin saith within the space of 24. houres, and then the horse wil go crovching al vpon the hinder legs, his forelegs being so stiffe, as he is not able to bow them. The cure whereof, according to Martin, is in this sort. Garter each leg immediatly one handful aboue the knee, with a list good and hard, and then walke him or chafe him, and so put him in a heat, and being somewhat warmed, let him blood in both the breast vaines, reseruing the blood to make a charge withal in this manner. Take of that bloode two quartes, and of Wheate-flower halfe a pecke, and sixe Egges, shelles and all, of bole Armony halfe a pounde, of Sanguis Draconis halfe a quarterne, and a quarte of stronge Vineger: mingle them altogether, and charge all his shoulders, Breast, Backe, Loynes, and Forelegges therewith, and then walke him vpon some hard ground, suffering him not to stand still, and when the charge is dry, re∣fresh it againe. And hauing walked him three or 4. houres together, lead him into the sta∣ble, and giue him a little warm water with ground mault in it, and then a litle hay and pro∣uender, and then walke him againe, either in the house, or else abroad, and continue thus the space of foure daies: and when all the charge is spent, couer him well with a housing cloth, and let him both stand & lye warme, and eat but little meat during the foure daies. But if you see that at the foure daies end he mendeth not a whit, then it is a sign that the humor lies in the foot, for the which you must search with your butter, paring all the soles of the fore-feete so thin as you shall see the water yssue through the sole. That done, with your butter, let him blood at both the toes, and let him bleede well. The stop the veine with a little hogs-grease, and then tacke on the shooes, and Turpentine molten together, and laid vpon a little Flax, and cram the place where you did let him blood hard with tow, to the intent it may be surely stopt. Then fil both his feet with hogs grease, and bran fried together in a stopping Pan, so hot as is possible. And vpon the stopping clap a piece of lea¦ther, or else two splents to keepe the stopping. And immediatly after this, take two Egges, beat them in a dish, and put therto bole Armony, and bean-flower somuch as wil thicken the same, and mingle them wel together, & make therof two plaisters, such as may close each foot round about, somwhat aboue the cronet, and bind it fast with a list or roler, that it may not fall away, nor be remoued for the space of three daies, but let the sole be clen∣sed, and new stopped euery day once, and the cronets to be remoued euery two daies, con∣tinuing so to do vntill it be whole. During which time, let him rest vnwalked, for feare of loosening his hooues. But if you see that he begin to amend, you may walke him faire and softly once a day vpon some soft ground, to exercise his legs and feet, and let him not eat much, nor drink cold water. But if this fundering breake out aboue the hooue, which you shal perceiue by the loosenesse of the coffin, aboue by the cronet, then when you pare the sole, you must take al the fore-part of the sole cleane away, leauing the heeles whole, to the intent the humors may haue the freer passage downeward, and then stop him, and dresse him about the cronet as is before said. Of Foundring. OF all other sorances, Foundering is soonest got, and hardlyest cured: yet if it may be perceiued in twenty and foure houres, Markham. and taken in hand by this meanes heere∣after prescribed, it shal be cured in other twenty and foure houres: notwithstand∣ing, the same receit, hath cured a horse that hath bin foundred a year & more, but then it was longer in bringing it to passe. Foundering commeth when a horse is heated, being in his grease and very fat, and taketh thereon a suddaine cold which striketh downe into his legs, and taking away the vse and feeling thereof. The signe to know it is, the horse cannot go, but wil stand cripling with al his foure legs together: if you offer to turne him, he wil couch his buttocks to the ground, and some Horses haue I seene sit on their buttocks to feede. The cure is thus: Let him blood of his two breast vaines, of his two shackle vains, and of his two vaines aboue the cronets of his hinder hooues: if the vaines wil bleed, take from them 3. pints at least, if they wil not bleed, then open his neck vain and take so much from thence. Saue the blood, and let one stand by and stir it as he bleeds lest it grow into lumps, when he hath don bleeding, take as much wheat-flower as wil thicken the blood, the whits of 20. Egges, and three or foure yolkes, then take a good quantity of Bolea minacke, and a pinte of strong vineger, incorporate al these wel together, and withal charge his backe, necke, head, and eares: then take two long rags of cloath and dip in the same charge, and withal garter him so straite as may be aboue both his knees of his forelegs, then let his kee∣per take him out to some stony causie, or high-way paued with stone, and there one follo∣wing him with a cudgel, let him trot vp and down for the space of an hour or two or more that don, set him vp and giue him some meat and for his drinke let him haue a warm mash: some three or foure houres after this, take off his garters, and set him in some pond of wa∣ter vp to the mid-side, and so let him stand for two houres, then take him out and set him vp, the next day pul off his shooes, and pare his feet very thin, and let him blood both of his heeles and toes, then set on his shooes again and stop them with hogs grease and bran boiling hot, and splint them vp, and so turne him out to run, and he shall be sound. Of the splent as well in the inside or outside of the knee, as other where in the Legges. THis sorance to any mans feeling is a very gristle sometime as big as a Walnut, and sometime no more then a Hasel nut, which is called of the Italians, Spinella, Blundevile and it commeth, as Laurentius Russius saith, by trauelling the horse too younge, or by op∣pressing him with heauy burthens offending his tender sinnewes, and so causeth him to halt. It is easie to know because it is apparant to the eye, and if you pinch it with your thumbe and finger, the horse will shrinke vp his leg. The cure whereof according to Mar∣tin, is in this sort. Wash it wel with warm water, and shaue off the haire, and lightly scarifie al the sore pla∣ces with the point of a rasor, so as the bloode may yssue forth. Then take of Cantharides halfe a spoonefull, and of Euforbium as much, beaten into fine powder, and mingle them together with a spoonefull of oile de bay, and then melt them in a little pan, stirring them well together, so as they may not boile ouer, and being so boiling hot, take two or 3. fea∣thers, and annoint all the sore place therewith. That done, let not the Horse stir from the place where you so dresse him for one houre after, to the intent he shake not off the oint∣ment. Then carry him fair and softly into the stable, and tye him as he may not reach with his head beneath the manger, for otherwise hee wil couet to bite away the smarting and pricking medicine, which if it should touch his lips, would quickly fetch of the skin. And also let him stand without litter all that day and night. The next day annoint the sore place with fresh butter, continuing so to do euery day once for the space of 9. daies, for this shal allay the heate of the medicine, and cause both that, and the crust to fall away of it selfe, and therewith either cleane take away the splent, or at the least remoue it out of the knee into the leg, and so much diminish it, as the Horse shal goe right vp, and halte no more through occasion thereof. Laurentius Russius would haue the splent to be cured by fiering it longst wise and ouerthwart. I haue seen the splent to be cleane taken away thus, first hauing clipt away the haire growing vpon the hard place, you must beat it with a good big stick of hasill almost a foot long, in which sticke somwhat distant from the one end thereof would be set fast a sharp pricke of a little piece of steele, to pricke the sore place therewith, once or twice to make the bloode yssue out, neuer lea∣uing to beat it first softly, and then harder and harder vntil it waxeth soft in euery place to the feeling, and to thrust out the bloud, partly with the sticke, leaning on it with both your hands, and partly with your thumbs: that done, wind about the sore place with a piece of double red wollen cloth, holding it so as it may lye close thereunto, then feare it vpon the cloth with the flat side of your fearing iron, made hot, and not red-hot, but so as it may not burne through the cloth, that done, take away the cloth, and lay vpon the sore a peece of shoomakers wax, made like a little cake, so broad as is the sore place, and then sear that into his Legs with your searing iron, vntill the wax be throughly molten, dryed, and sun∣ken into the sore: that don, seare another piece of waxe in like manner into the sore, vntill it be dryed vp, and then you may trauell your horse immediatly vpon it if you will, for he will not halt no more. Of the splent. A Splent is a sorance of the least moment, vnlesse it bee on the knee, or else a through Splent, both which cannot bee cured: A Splent is a spungy harde grissell or bone, Markham. growing fast on the inside of the shin-bone of a Horsse, where a little making stark the sinnewes compels a Horsse somewhat to stumble: the cures are diuers and thus they be. If the splent be young, tender, and but new in breeding, then cast the horse, and take a spoonefull of that Oyle called Petrolium, and with that Oyle rubbe the Splent till you make it soft, then take a fleame, such as you let a horse bloud withall, and strike the splent in two or three places, then with your two thombes thrust it hard, and you shal see crusht matter & blood come out, which is the very Splent, then set him vp and let him rest, or run at grasse for a weeke or more: others for a young Spleent do thus: take a hasell sticke and cut it square, and therewithall beate the splint till it be soft, then take a blew cloath and lay vppon the splent, and take a Taylors pressing yron made hot and rub it vp and downe vpon the cloath ouer the splent and it shall take it cleane away. But if the splent be old & great and growne to the perfection of hardnesse, then you must cast the Horse and with a sharp knife slit down the splent, then take Cantharides and Euforbium, of each like quan∣tity, and boyle them in Oyle debay, and with that fill vp the slit, and renewe it for three daies together, then take it away, & anoint the place with Oyle debay, Oyle of Roses or Tar, vntill it be whole. Of a Malander. Blundevile A Malander is a kinde of scab growing in the forme of lines, or strokes, o∣uerthwart the bent of the knee, and hath long haires with stubborne rootes, like the bristles of a Bore which corrupteth and cankereth the flesh, like the rootes of a child as scabbed head: and if it bee great it will make the Horse to go stiffe at the setting forth, and also to halt. This dis∣ease proceedeth sometime of corrupt bloode, but most commonly for lacke of cleane keeping, and good rubbing. The cure according to Martin, is thus. First wash it well with warm water, then shaue both haire and scab clean away, leauing nothing but the bare flesh, whereunto lay this plaister. Take a spoonefull of Sope, and as much of lime: mingle them together, that it may be like paast, and spread as much on a clout as will couer the sore, and binde it fast on with a list, renewing it euery day once the space of two or three daies, and at the three dayes end, take away the plaister and annoint the sore with oyle of Roses made lukewarme, and that shall fetch away the crust▪scurfe, bred by meanes of the plaister, which being taken away, wash the sore place well euery day once with his owne stale, or else with mans vrine, and then immediately straw vpon it the pow∣der of burnt oystershels, continuing thus to do euery day once, vntill it be whole. Another of the Mallander. A Mallander is a peeuish sorance and commeth of ill keeping, it is on the fore-legs, iust on the inside, Markham. at the bending of the kne, it will make a horse go stark, & stumble much the cure is in this sorte. Cast the Horse, and with some instrument pluck off the dry scab that wil sticke thereon, and rub it till it bleede, then take and bind it thereto for three daies, in which space you shall see a white asker on the sore, then take that off, and annoint it with oyle of Roses or fresh butter, vntill it be throughly cured. Of an vpper attaint or ouerreach vpon the backe sinnew of the shanke, somewhat aboue the ioynt. T He Italians call this sorance Atrincto, which is a painefull swelling of the maister sinnew, by meanes that the Horse doth sometime ouerreach, and strike that sinnew with the toe of his hinder foote, which causeth him to halt. The signes be apparant by the swelling of the place, and by the hor∣ses halting. The cure, according to Martin, is thus: wash the place with warme water, and shaue all the haire so farre as the swelling goeth, and scarifie euery part of the sore place lightly with the point of a rasor, that the bloode may yssue forth. Then take of Cantharides and of Euforbium, of each halfe an ounce, mingle them together with halfe a quarterne of Sope, and with a slice spread some of this oyntmentouer al the sore, suffering him to rest there as you dresse him for one halfe houre after, and then you may carry him into the stable, and there let him stand without litter, and tyed as hath beene said before in the Chapter of the spleene, and the next day dresse him with the same ointment once againe, euen as you did before. And the thirde daye annoint the place with fresh Butter, continuing so to do the space of nine daies, and at the nine daies end make him this bath. Take of Mallowes three handfuls, a Rose-cake, of Sage an handfull. Boile them togither in a sufficient quantity of water. And when the Mallowes be soft, put in halfe a pounde of Butter, and halfe a pinte of Sallet oyle, and then being somewhat warme, wash the sore place therewith euery day once, the space of three or foure dayes. Of a nether taint. THis is a little bladder ful of ielly, much like vnto a wind-gal, not apparant to the eie, Blundevile but to the feeling, growing in the midst of the pasterne, somewhat aboue the frush. It commeth by a straine, or else by some wrench, or by any ouer-reach, and maketh the horse to halt. The signes be these. The neathet-ioynt toward the Fewterlocke will be hot in feeling, and somewhat swollen. The cure, according to Martin is in this sort. Tie him aboue the ioynt with a list somewhat harde, and that will cause the bladder to appeare to the eye. Then lance it with a sharpe pointed knife, and thrust out al the ielly. That doone, lay vnto it the white of an Egge, and a little salt beaten together, and laid vppon Flaxe or Towe, and binde it fast vnto the sore, renewing it once a day the space of foure or fiue daies, during which time let him rest, and then you may boldly labour him. Of an Ataint. AN Attaint is a griefe that commeth by an ouer-reach, Markham. as clapping one legge vppon another, or by some other horses treading vpon his heels, the cure is: take a sharp knife and cut out the ouer-reach, that is, if it be neuer so deepe like a hole, cut it plain and smooth, howe broade soeuer you make it, then wash it with Beere and Salt, and lay to it Hogges grease, Wax, Turpentine, and Rozen, of each like quantity boiled and mingled togither, and this wil in few daies heale him, be it neuer so sore. Of an ouer-reach vpon the heele. THis is a cut, so as the skinne hang s downe at the heele, made with the toe of the hinder foot, and is apparant to the eie, and it wil cause the horse somewhat to halt. The cure whereof according to Martin is thus. Cut away the skinne that hangeth downe, and binde a little Flaxe dipt in the white of an Egge, mingled with a little bole Armony, renewing it euery day once the space of three or foure daies, and that will heale it. Of false quarters. THis is a rifte sometime in the outside, but most commonly in the inside of the hooue, because the inside is euer the weaker part, which sides are commonly cald quarters, and therof this sorance taketh his name, and is called a false quarter, that is to say, a crased or vnsound quarter, which name indeed is borrowed of the Italians, cal∣ling it in their toong Falso quarto. It commeth by euil shooing, and partly by euil paring. The signes be these. The horse wil for the most part halt, and the rift wil bleed, and is ap∣parant to the eye. The cure according to Martin is thus. If the horse halt, then pul off the shooe, and cut so much away on that side of the shooe where the griefe is, as the shooe being immediately put on againe, the rift may be vncouered. Then open the rift with a Rosenet or drawer, and fil the rift with a role of Towe dipt in Turpentine, Waxe, and Sheepes sewet molten, renewing it euery day once, vntil it be whole: And the rift being closed in the top, draw him betwixt the haire and the hooue with a hot yron ouerthwart that place, to the intent that the hooue may shoote al whole downeward, and when the horse goeth vpright, ride him with no other shooe, vntil his hooue be throughly harde∣ned againe. Of halting behind, and where the griefe is. Blundevile IF a horse halt behind, the griefe must either be in the hip, in the stiffle, in the hough, in the hamme, in the legge, in the neather ioynt, pasterne or foot. If he halt in the hippe of a new hurt, the horse wil go sideling, and not followe so well with that legge as with the other. But if it be old hurt, the sore hippe wil shrink and be lower then the other. And is best seene, when hee goeth vp a hil, or vpon the edge of some banke, so as the woorste legge may go on the higher side, for then he wil halt so much more, because it is paineful vnto him to go so vneuenly wrinching his legge. If the griefe bee in the stiffle, then the horse in his going wil cast the stiffle ioynt outward, and the bone on the inside wil be farre bigger than the other. If the griefe bee in the hough, then it is by meanes of some Spauen, or some other hurt apparant to the eie. And the like may be said of the ham, wherein may be seene the Selander, or such like apparant sorance, causing the horse to halt: If the griefe be eyther in the leg, pasterne or foot, then you shal finde it by such signes as haue bin taught you before. And therefore let vs now speake of those sorances, that are properly incident to the hinder legs. Of the String-halt. THe String-hault is a disease that maketh a horse twitch vp his legge sodenly, and so hault much, it commeth sometimes naturally, and sometimes causually, by means of some great cold whereby the sinnewes are strained: the best cure thereof, is to dig a pit in some dunghil, Markham. as deepe as the horse is hie, and set the horse in, & couer him with warme dung, and so let him stande the space of two houres, then take him out and make him cleane, and then bath him al ouer with Traine-oile made warme, and it wil help him. Of a horse that is hipped, or hurt in the hippes. THe horse is said to be hipt, when the hip-bone is remooued out of his right place, which griefe is called of the Italians Mal del ancha. It cummeth most commonly by some great stripe or straine, slipping, sliding, or falling. The signes be these. The horse wil halt, and in his going he wil go sideling, and the sore hip wil fal lower than the other, and the flesh in processe of time will consume cleane away. And if it be suffred to run so long, it wil neuer be restored vnto his prestine estate. The best way as Martin sayth to make him go vpright, is to charge his hip and backe with Pitch and Rozen molten to∣gither, and laid on warme, and then some flox of his owne colour to be clapped vppon the same, and so let him run to grasse, vntil he go vpright. But the sore hip wil neuer rise againe so high as the other. If the horse be not hipped, but onely hurt in the hip, and that newly, then first take of oile de Bay, of Dialthea, of Nerual, of Swines-greace, melt them altogither, stirring them continually vntil they be throughly mingled togither, and an∣noint the sore place against the haire with this ointment euery day once, the space of a fortnight, and make the ointment to sinke wel into the flesh, by holding a hot broad barre ouer the place annointed, weauing your hand too and fro, vntil the ointment be entred into the skin. And if at the fortnights end, you see that the horse amendeth no whitte for this, then slit a hole downward in his skin, and an inch beneath the hip-bone, making the hole so wide, as you may easily thruste in a rowel with your finger, and then with a little broade slice or yron, losen the skin from the flesh aboue the bone, and round about the same, so broad as the rowel may lye flat and plaine betwixt the skin and the flesh, which rowel would be made of soft Calues-leather, with a hole in the midst like a ring, hauing a thred tied vnto it, to pul it out when you would clense the hole, and if the rowel be row∣led about with flax fasttied on, & anointed with thointment vnder written, it wil draw so much the more: and thrust in the rowel first double, and then spred it abroad with your finger. That done, tainr it with a good long taint of flax or tow dipt in a little Turpentine and hogs-greace molten togither and made warme, and cleanse the hole and the rowel euery day once, and also renew the taint euery day for the space of a fornight. And before you dresse him, cause him euery day to be ledde vp and downe a foot pace a quarter of an houre, to make the humors come downe, and at the fortnights end pul out the rowel, and heale vp the wound with the same salue, making the taint euery day lesser, and lesser vntil it be whole. And so soone as it is whole, draw with a hot yron crosse lines, of eight or nine inches long, right ouer the hip-bone, so as the rowelled place may bee in the very midst thereof, and burne him no deeper, but so as the skin may looke yellow and then charge al that place, and ouer al his buttocks with this charge. Take of pitch one pound, of Rozen halfe a pounde, of Tarre halfe a pinte: Boile them together, and then being good and warme, spred it on with a clout tied in a riuen sticke: and then clap on a few flockes of the horses colour. And if it be in Summer, let the horse runne to grasse a while, for the more he trauelleth at his owne wil, the better it is for him. Of stiffling, and hurts in the stiffle. T He horse is said to be stiffled, when the stiffling bone is remoued from the place: but if it be not remoued nor loosened, and yet the horse halteth by meanes of some griefe there, then we say that the horse is hurt in the stif∣fle, and not stiffled. The stiffle commeth by means of some blow, or some great straine, slipping or sliding. The signes be these. If he be stiffled, the one bone wil sticke out farther than the other, and is apparant to the eie. Martin woulde haue you to cure the stiffle in al points like vnto the shoulder-pight, sauing that the pins need not bee so long, because the stifling place is not so broad as the shoulder, and stan∣ding in the stable, let him haue a pasterne with a Ring on his forelegge, and thereunto fa∣sten a cord, which cord must go about his necke, and let it be so much strained, as it may bring his forelegge more forward than the other to keepe the bone from starting out. But if the horse bee but hurt in the stiffle with some stripe or straine, then the bone wil not stand out, but perhaps the place may be swollen. The cure according to Martin is thus. First annoint the place with the ointment mentioned before, euery day once the space of a fortnight, and if the horse amend not with this, then rowel him with a hearen rowel, or else with a quil, and let the neather hole be somwhat before the sore place, and clense the hole euery daye, by turning the rowel, continuing stil to annoint the place with the ointment aforesaid, and that wil make him whole. Of foundering behind. THis happes most commonly when a horse is very fat, and hath his greace moulten within him, which is soone done with euery little heate. You shal perceiue it by his going, for he wil be afraide to set his hinder feet to the grounde, and he wil bee so weake behind, as he wil stand quiuering and shaking and couet alwaies to lie downe. The cure, according to Martin is thus. First garter him aboue the houghes, and then force him to go awhile to put him in a heat, and being somewhat warme, let him bloode in the thigh vaines, reseruing of that blood a pottle, to make him a charge in this sort. Put vnto that blood, of Wheat-flower and of Beane-flower, of each a quarter of a pecke, of Bole Armony one pound, of Sanguis Draconis two ounces, six Egges, shels and al, of Turpen∣tine halfe a pound, of Vineger a quart. Mingle al these thinges togither, and therewith charge both his hinder Legges, his Reynes, and Flankes, al against the haire. And if the horse cannot dung, lette him be raked, and giue him this glister: take of Mallowes three handfuls, and boile them wel in faire Water from a pottle to a quart. Then straine it and put thereunto halfe a pounde of Butter, and of Sallet Oyle a quarter of a pinte, and ha∣uing emptied his belly, giue him also this drinke to comforte him; take of Malmesie a quart, and put thereunto a little Cinamon, Mace, and Pepper, beaten into fine powder and of Oyle a quarter of a pinte, and giue the horse to drinke of that Luke-warme with a horne. That don, let him be walked vp and downe a good while togither if he be able to go: if not, then tie him vp to the racke, and let him be hanged with Canuas and ropes, so as he may stand vppon the ground with his feet: For the lesse he lieth the better, and pare his hinder feet thin, vntill the deaw come out, and tacking on the shooes againe, stoppe the hooues with bran and hogs greace boiled togither, and let both his feet hauing this geere in it, be wrapped vp in a cloath euen to his pasternes, and there tie the clout fast. Let his diet be thinne and let him drinke no colde water, and giue him in winter wet hay, and in Summer grasse. Of the dry Spauen. Blundevile THe dry Spauin called of the Italians Spauano or Sparauagno, is a great hard knob as big as a Walnut growing in the inside of the hough, hard vnder the ioynt, nigh vn∣to the maister vaine, and causeth the horse to halt, which sorance commeth by kind because the horses parents perhaps had the like disease at the time of his generation, and sometime by extreame labour and heat dissoluing humors which do descend thorough the maister vaine, continually feeding that place with euil nutriment, and causeth that place to swel. Which swelling in continuance of time becommeth so hard as a bone, and therefore is called of some the bone-Spauen. It needeth no signes or tokens to knowe it because it is very much apparant to the eie, and therefore most Ferrers doe take it to be incurable. Notwithstanding, Martin saith, that it may bee made lesse with these remedies heere following. Wash it with warme water, and shaue off the haire so farre as the swelling ex∣tendeth and scarifie the place, so as it may bleed. Then take of Cantharides one dozen, of Euforbium halfe a spoonefull, breake them into powder, and boile them togither with a little oile de Bay, and with two or three feathers bound togither, put it boiling hot vpon the sore, and let his taile be tyed vp for wiping away the medicine; and then within halfe an houre after, set him vp in the stable, and tie him so as he may not lie downe al the night for feare of rubbing off the medicine, and the next day annoint it with fresh butter, con∣tinuing thus to do euery day once the space of fiue or sixe daies, and when the haire is growne againe, draw the sore place with a hot yron. Then take another hot sharpe yron like a Bodkin, somewhat bowing at the point, and thruste it in at the neather end of the middle-line, and so vppeward betwixt the skinne and the flesh to the compasse of an inch and a halfe. And then taint it with a little Turpentine and Hogges-greace moulten together and made warme, renewing it euery day once the space of nine daies. But remember first im¦mediately after his burning to take vppe the maister vaine, suffering him to bleed a little from aboue, and tie vp the vper end of the vaine, and leaue the neather end open, to the intent that hee may bleede from beneath vntil it cease it selfe, and that shal diminish the Spauen, or else nothing wil do it. Of the Spauen, both bone and blood. D Oubtlesse a Spauen is an euil sorance, and causeth a horse to hault princi∣pally in the beginning of his griefe, Markham. it appeareth on the hinder Legges within, and against the ioynt, and it will bee a little swolne, and some hor∣ses haue a thorough Spauen, which appeareth both within and without. Of the Spauen there are two kindes, the one hard the other soft: That is: a bone-Spauen, and a blood-Spauen, for the bone-Spauen I holde it harde to cure, and therefore the lesse necessary to be dealt withal, except very great occasion vrge, and thus it may be holpen. Cast the horse and with a hot yron slitte the flesh that couereth the Spauen, and then lay vpon the Spauen, Cantharides and Euforbium boyled together in oile de Bay, and an∣noint his legges round about, either with the oile of Roses, and with Vngue tum album camphiratum. Dresse him thus for three daies togither, then afterwarde take it awaye and for three daies more lay vnto it onely vpon Flaxe and vnsleact lime, then afterward dresse it with Tarre vntil it be whole. The Cantharides and Euforbium, wil eat & kil the spungy bone, the lime wil bring it clean away, and the Tarre wil sucke out the poison, and heale al vp sound: but this cure is dan∣gerous, for if the incision be done by an vnskilful man, and he either by ignorance or by the swaruing of his hand, burne in twaine the great vaine that runnes crosse the Spauen, then the horse is spoiled. Now for the blood Spauen that is easily helpt, for I haue knowne diuers which haue beene but newly beginning, helpt onely by taking vppe the Spauen vaine, and letting it bleed wel beneath, and then stop the wound with Sage, and Salt, but if it be a great blood Spauen, then with a sharpe knife, cut it as you burnt the bone Spauen, and take the Spa∣uen away, then heale it vp with Hogges-greace and Turpentine onely. Of the wet Spauen, or through Spauen. T His is a soft swelling growing on both sides of the hough and seemes to goe cleane through the hough, and therefore may bee called a through Spauen. But for the most part the swelling is on the inside, because it is continually fed of the master vain, & is greater than the swelling on the outside. The Italians cal this sorance Laierda, or Gierdone, which seemeth to come of a more fluxible humor, and not so viscous or slimy as the other Spauen doeth, and therefore this waxeth not so harde, nor groweth to the nature of a bone as the other doeth, and this is more curable then the other. It needes no signes, because it is apparant to the eie, and easie to know by the description thereof before made: The cure according to Martin is thus. Firste wash, shaue, and scarifie the place as before. Then take of Cantharides halfe an ounce, of Eufor∣bium an ounce broken to powder, & Oyle de Bay one ounce, mingle them wel together colde, without boiling them, and dresse the sore therewith two daies togither, and euery day after, vntil the haire be growne againe, annoint it with fresh Butter. Then fire him both without and within, as before, without tainting him, and immediately take vp the maister veine, as before: and then for the space of nine daies, annoint him euery daye once with Butter, vntil the fiered place beginne to scale, and then wash it with this bath. Take of Mallowes three handfuls, of Sage one handful, and as much of red nettles, boile them in water vntil they be soft, and put thereunto a litle fresh butter, and bath the place euery day once for the space of three or foure daies, and vntil the burning be whole, let the horse come in no wet. Of the Selander. THis is a kind of scab breeding in the ham, which is the bent of the hough, and is like in al points, to the Malander, proceeding of like causes, and requireth like cure, and therefore resort to the Malander. Of the hough boonie, or hard knob. THis is a round swelling boony, like a Paris bal, growing vpon the tippe or elbow of the hough, and therefore I thought good to cal it the hough-boonie. This sorance commeth of some stripe or bruse, and as Martin saith, is cured thus. Take a round hot yron somewhat sharpe at the ende like a good bigge bodkin, and let it be somewhat bending at the point. Then holding the sore with your left hande, pulling it somewhat from the sinnewes, pierce it with the yron, being first made red hot, thrusting it beneath in the bottome, and so vpward into the belly, to the intent that the same ielly may yssue downeward out at the hole, and hauing thrust out al the ielly, taint the hole with a tainte of Flaxe dipt in Turpentine, and Hogges greace moulten together, and also annointe the out-side with Hogges greace made warme, renewing it euery daye once vntill the hole be ready to shut vp, making the taint euery day lesser and lesser, to the intent it may heale vp. Of the Curbe. Blundevile T His is a long swelling beneath the Elbow of the hough, in the great sinnewe behind, and causeth the horse to halt, after that he hath been a while laboured and thereby somewhat heated. For the more the sinnew is strained, the grea∣ter griefe, which againe by his rest is eased. This commeth by bearing some great weight when the horse is younge, or else by some straine or wrinch, whereby the tender sinnewes are greeued, or rather bowed (as Russsius saith (whereof it is, called in I∣talian Curba a Curuando, that is to say, of bowing, for anguish whereof it doth swel, which swelling is apparant to the eie, and maketh that legge to shew bigger than the other. The cure according to Martin is thus: Take of wine-Leeze a pinte, a porringer ful of Wheat flower, of Cumin halfe an ounce, and stirre them well togither, and being made warme charge the sore 3. or 4. daies, and when the swelling is almost gone, then draw it with a hot yron, and couer the burning with Pitch and Rozen moulten together, and lay it on good and warme, and clap thereon some flockes of his owne colour, or so nigh as may be gotten, and remoue them not, vntil they fal away of themselues. And for the space of nine daies let the horsse rest, and come in no wet. Another of the Curbe. Markham. A Curbe is a sorance that maketh a horse to halt much, and it appeares vpon his hin∣der legges, straight behind vpon the cambrell place, and a little beneath the Spa∣uen, and it wil be swolne as big as halfe a Walnut, the cure followeth: Take a small cord and bind his legges hard aboue it, and beneath it, then beat it, and rub it with a hea∣uy sticke til it growe soft, then with a fleame strike it in three or foure places, and with your thumbes crush out the filthy brused matter, then loose the corde, and annoint it with Butter vntil it be whole. Of the paines. Blundevile THis is a kinde of scabbe, called in Italian, Crappe, which is full of fretting matterish water, and it breede h in the pasternes for lacke of cleane keeping and good rub∣bing after the horse hath beene iournied, by means wherof the sand & dirt remai∣ning in the haire, fretteth the skin and flesh, and so breedeth a scab. And therefore those horses that haue long haire, and are rough about the feet, are soonest troubled with this disease, if they be not the cleanlier kept. The signes be these. His legs wil bee swollen and hot, and water wil yssue out of the scab, which water his hot and fretting, as it wil scalde off the haire and breed scabs, so farre as it goeth. The cure, according to Martin is thus. First wash wel al the pasternes with Beere and Butter warmed togither, and his legs be∣ing somewhat dried with a cloth: clip away al the haire, sauing the fewter lockes. Then take of Turpentine, of Hogges-greace, of hony of each like quantity, mingle them to∣gither in a pot, and put thereunto a little Bole Armony, the yelkes of two Egges, and as much Wheat-flower as wil thicken the things aforesaid, and make it plaister-like, and for that cause it had need to be very wel wrought and stirred togither. Then with a slice strike some of the plaister vpon such a peece of linnen cloath as wil serue to go round about the pasterne, and bind it fast on with a rowler, renewing it once a day, vntil it be whole, and let not the horse be trauelled nor stand wet. Another of the paines. PAines is a sorance that commeth of hot ill humors of il keeping: it appeareth in the Fetlockes, Markham. and wil swel in the Winter time, and wil send foorth a sharpe water: the haire wil stare, and the cure is thus: Wash them euery day twice or thrice with gun-pouder and Vineger, and they wil be whole in one weeke at the most. Of Mules or kibed heeles, called of the Italians Mule. THis is a kind of scab breeding behind, somewhat aboue the neather ioynt, growing ouerthwat the fewterlock, which commeth most commonly for being bred in cold ground, or else for lack of good dressing, after that he hath bin labored in foule mire and dirty waies, which durt lying stil in his legs, fretteth the skin, and maketh scabby rifts, which are soone bred, but not so soone gotten away. The anguish wherof maketh his legs somtime to swell, and specially in winter and spring time, and then the horse goeth very stif∣ly, and with great pain. The sorance is apparant to the eie, and is cured according to Mar∣tin in this sort. Take a piece of linnen cloth, and with the salue recited in the last chap. make such a plaister as may couer al the sore place, and binde it fast on that it may not fall off, re∣newing it euery day once vntil the sore leaue running, and beginneth to wax dry, then wash it euery day once with strong water, vntill it be cleane dryed vp, but if this sorance be but in breeding, & there is no raw flesh, then it shal suffice to anoint it with Sope two or three daies, and at the three daies end to wash them with a little Beefe broath or dish water. Of Frettishing. FRettishing is a sorance that commeth of riding a horse, til he sweat, and then to set him vp without litter, wher he taketh suddenly cold in his feet, & chiefely before: Markham. it appears vnder the heele in the hart of the foot: for it will grow dun, and wax white and crumbly like a Pomys, & also in time it wil show, by the wrinckles on his hoofe, and the hoofe wil grow thicke and brickle, he wil not be able to tread, on stones or hard ground, nor well to trauel but stumble and fal: the cure is thus: Take and pare his feet so thin as may be, then rost two or three Egs, in the Embers very hard, & being extream hot taken out of fire, crush them in his foot, and then clap a piece of leather theron, and splint it that the Egges may not fal out, and so let him run and he will be sound. Of sorances or griefes that be common to all foure feet. HItherto we haue declared vnto you the causes, signs and cure of all such griefes as are properly incident, either to the forelegs, or hinder legs: now therefore we speake of those griefes that be common to them both, and first of windgals. Of Windgalles. THe windgall called of the Italians Galla, is a bladder full of corrupt ielly, Blundevile whereof some be great and some bee small, and do grow on each side of the ioynt, and is so painfull, and especially in summer season when the wether is hot and the waies hard, as the horse is not able to trauell but halteth downe right. They come for the most part through extreame labor and heat, whereby the humors being dissolued, doe flow and re∣sort into the hollow places about the neather ioynts, and there be congealed and couered with a thin skin like a bladder. They bee apparant to the eie and therefore neede no other signes to know them. The cure whereof according to Martin is thus. Wash them with water and shaue off the haire, scarifie them with the point of a rasor, and dresse them with Cantharides in the selfesame manner as the splent in the knee was taught before, and an∣noint them afterward with butter vntil the skin be whole. And if this will not heale it, then draw them with a hot iron like a ragged staffe. That done slit the middle line which passeth right downe through the windgall with a sharpe knife, beginning beneath and so vpward the length of halfe an inch, to the intent you may thrust the ielly out at that hole, then lay vnto it a little pitch and rozen molten together, and made lukewarme, and put a few floxe on it, and that will heale him. And you may dry vp the windgall in such manner as heere followeth. First chop off the haire so far as the windgall extendeth, and hauing striken it with a fleame, thrust out the ielly with your finger. Then take a peece of red wollen cloath and clap it to the place, and with a hot broad searing iron seare it, so as the iron may not burne through the cloth, which is don to dry vp the humors. Then hauing taken away the cloth, lay vnto the place a peece of shoomakers waxe made like a flat cake, about the breadth of a testorn, and with your iron not made ouer hot, streek softly vpon it too and fro, vntill the said wax be throughly melted into the sore. Wherup∣on lay a few flox, and let him go. Which flocks will afterward fall away of their owne ac∣cord. Of Windgals. WIngals are easie to cure, they be little swellings like blebs or bladders, on either side the ioint next vnto the feuter-locks, as wel before as behind, and they come through the occasion of great trauell, Markham. in hard, grauelly, or sandy waies. The cure is. Take Pitch, Ro∣zen, and Mastick, of each like quantity, melt them together, and with a stick lay it round a∣bout the horses legs, and whilest it is hot lay flocks theron: the nature of this plaister, is ne∣uer to come away whilst there is any windgall on the Horses legs, but when they are dried vp, then it will fall away of itselfe. Of wrinching the neather ioynt. THis commeth many times by treading awry in some cart root or otherwise. The signs be these. The ioynt will be swollen and sore, and the horse will halt. The cure whereof according to Martin is thus: take of Dialthea halfe a pounde, and as much of Neruall. Mingle them together and anoint the sore place therewith, chafing it well with both your hands that the oyntment may enter, continuing so to do euery day once, vntill the oynt∣ment be all spent, and let the horse rest. But if this will not preuaile, then wash it with warm water and shaue away all the haire sauing the fewter-lock. Scarifie it and lay to it Cantha∣rides, and heale it as you do each splent in the knee. Of enterfering. BIcause enterfering is to be holpen by shooing, wee purpose not to speake of it, vntill we come to talke of the order of paring and shooing all manner of hooues. Another of Enterfering. ENterfering is a griefe that commeth sometimes by ill shooing, and somtimes natural∣ly, when a horse trots so narrow that he hewes on leg vpon another, it appeareth both before and behind, betweene the feete against the fet-lockes, and there is no remedy but shooing him with shooes made thin and flat on the outside, and narrow and thicke with∣in. Of the shakell gall. IF a horse be galled in the pasterns, with shakell, locke pasterne, or halter, anoint the sore place with a little Hony and Verdigrease boiled together, vntill it looke red which is a good ointment for all gallings on the withers and immediatly strow vpon the ointment, being first laid vpon the leg, a little chopt flax or tow and that will stick fast, continuing so to do euery day once vntill it be whole. Of hurts in the legs, that commeth by casting in the halter or collar. undevile I T chanceth many times, that a Horsse hauing some itch vnder his eares, is de∣sirous to scratch the same with his hinder foote which whilest he reacheth too and fro, doth fasten in the coller or halter, wherewith the more that he striueth the more he galleth his Legges, and many times it chanceth for that he is ty∣ed so long, by means wherof being laid, and the halter slack about his feet, rising perhaps or turning he snarleth himselfe so as he is not able to get vp, but hangeth either by the neck or Legges, vvhich sometimes are galled euen to the hard bone. Russius calleth such kinde of galling Capistratura, which he was wont to heale with this ointment heere following, praising it to be excellent good for the cratches, or any scab, bruise, or wound: take of oile Oliue one ounce, of Turpentine two or three ounces, melt them together ouer the fire, and then put thereunto a little wax, and work them well togi∣ther, and annoint the sore place therwith. Martin saith it is good to annoint the sore place with the white of an egge and sallet-oile beaten together, and when it commeth to a scab, annoint it with butter being molten, vntill it looke browne. Of the Cratches or Rats tailes, called of the Italians Crepaccie. THis is a kind of long scabby rifts growing right vp and down in the hinder part, from the fewterlock vp to the Curb, and commeth for lacke of cleane keeping, and is easily seene if you take vp the horses foot, and lift vp the haire. The cure according to Martin is thus. Take of Turpentine halfe a pound, of hony a pint, of hogs-grease a quarterne, and 3. yolks of Egs, and of bole Armony a quartern, beaten into fine powder, of bean flower halfe a pinte, mingle all these well together, and make a salue thereof, and with your finger annoint all the sore places, sheading the haire as you go, to the intent you may the easier find them, and also to make the salue enter into the skin, and let the horse come in no wet, vntill he be whole. Of the Scratches. SCratches will cause a horse to halt sore, and they come only by naughty keeping, and they appeare in the pasterns vnder the Fetlocks, as if the skin were cut ouerthwart, Markham that a man may lay in a wheat-straw: the cure is thus: bind vnto thē (the haire being cut cleane away) black Sope and Lime kned together, for three daies, then lay that by, and annoynt the place with butter, and heale the sore with Bores greace and Tar mixt well together. Of the Ring-bone. THis is a hard grisle growing vpon the cronet, and sometime goeth round about the cronet, and is called in Italian Soprosso. Laurentius Russius saith, that it may grow in a∣ny other place of the Leg, but then we cal it not a Ring-bone, but a knot or knob. It com∣meth at the first either by some blow of another Horse, or by striking his owne foote a∣gainst some stub, or stone, or such like casualty. The paine whereof breederh a viscous and slimy humor, which resorting to the bones, that are of their owne nature colde and dry, waxeth hard, cleaueth to some bone, and in processe of time becommeth a bone. The signes be these. The Horse will halt, and the hard swelling is apparant to the eie, being higher then any place of the cronet. The cure according to Martin is thus. First wash it well with warme water, and shaue away all the haire, so as the sore place may be all discouered. Then scari∣fie it lightly with the point of a rasor, so as the bloude may yssue forth. Then if the sore be broad, take of Euforbium one ounce, of Cantharides halfe an ounce, broken into fine pow∣der, and of Oyle de Bay one ounce, and if the sore bee but little, the one halfe of this may serue. Boile these things together, stirring them continually least it run ouer, and with two or three feathers, lay it boiling hot vnto the sore, & let not the horse stir from that place for halfe an houre after, then carry him into the stable, both vsing and curing him for the space of nine daies, in such order as hath been said before in the chapter of the splent. But when the haire beginneth to grow again, then fire the sore place with right lines from the pasterne downe to the coffin of the hooue, and let the edge of the drawing iron be as thick as the backe of a meat knife, and burne him so deepe as the skinne may looke yellow: that done, couer the burning with pitch and rozen molten together, and clap thereon flox of the Horsses owne colour, or somewhat nigh the same, and about three daies after, lay a∣gaine some of the last mentioned plaister, or oyntment, and also new floxe vpon the olde, and there let them remaine, vntill they fall away of themselues. But if these ring-bones, or knobs, breede in any other place, then in the cronet, you shal cure them, as is before said, without firing them. Of the Ring-bone. THe Ring-bone is an il disease, and apeareth before on the foot aboue the hoofe, aswell before as behind, Markham. and will be swolne 3. inches broad, and a quarter of an inch or more of height, and the haire will stare and wax thin, and will make a Horse halt much, the cure is. Cast the Horse, and with an iron made flat and thin, burne away that gristle which an∣noies him, then take wax, Turpentine, Rozen, Tar, and hogs-grease, of each like quantity, mingle them together plaister-wise, and with it cure the sore: this plaister wil also cure a∣ny other wound or vlcer whatsoeuer. Of the Crowne-scab. THis is a kind of filthy and stinking scab, breeding round about the feete vpon the cro∣nets, Blundevile and is an eluish and painful disease, called in Italian Crisaria. It seemeth to come by meanes that the Horse hath bin bred in some colde wet soile, striking corrupt humors vp to his feet, and therefore the horse that hath this griefe is worse troubled in winter then in summer. The signs be these. The haire of the cronets wil be thin and staring like bristles, and the cronets wil be alwaies mattering, and run on a water. The cure according to Mar∣tin is thus. Take of sope, of hogs-grease, of each halfe a pound, of bole Armony a little, of Turpentine a quartern, and mingle them all together, and make a plaister and bind it fast on renewing it euery day once, vntill it leaue running, and then wash it with strong vine∣ger being lukewarme euery day once vntill he sore be cleane dryed vp, and let him come in no wet, vntill it be whole. Of hurts vpon the cronet crossing one foot ouer another, which the Italians call Supraposte. MArt▪ saith wash it wel with white wine, or with a little stale, & then lay vnto it the white of an Egge mingled with a little chimny soot and salt, and that will dry it vp in three or foure daies, if it be renewed euery day once. Of the quitterbone. THis is a hard round swelling vpon the cronet, betwixt the heele and the quarter, and groweth most commonly on the inside of the foot, and is commonly called of the Italians Setula, or Seta. It commeth by meanes of grauell gathered vnderneath the shooe, which frerteth the heele, or else by the cloying or pricking of some naile euell dry∣uen, the anguish whereof looseneth the gristle, and so breedeth euill humors, wherof the quitterbone springeth. The signes be these. The horse will halt, and the swelling is appa∣rant to the eie, which in foure or fiue daies comming to a head, wil breake out with mat∣ter at a little deep hole like a Fistula. The cure acording to Martin is thus. First burn about the quitterbone with a hot iron, in manner of halfe a circle, and then with the same yron draw another right strike through the midst thereof. Then take of Arsenicke the quantity of a Bean beaten into fine powder, and put it into the hole, thrusting it downe to the bot∣tom with a quil, and stop the mouth of the hole with a littletowe, and bind it so fast with a cloth, and cord, as the Horse may not come at it with his mouth, and so let it rest for that day. And the next day, if you see that the sore looketh blacke within, then it is a signe that the Arsenicke hath wrought well and done his part. Then to allay the burning thereof, taint the hole with flax dipt in hogs grease, and tur∣pentine, molten and mingled together, and couer the taint with a bolster of tow dipt also in the ointment aforesaid, continuing so to do euery day once, vntil you haue gotten out the core. Then shall you see whether the loose gristle in the bottom be vncouered or not, and if it be vncouered, then feele with your finger, or with a quil, whether you be nigh it or not. And if you be, then raise the gristle with a litle crooked instrument, & pul it clean out with a paire of small nippers, meete for the purpose. That done, taint it againe with a full taint dipt it the aforesaid ointment, to asswage the anguish of the last dressing, and stop it hard, to the intent that the hole may not shrinke together or close vp, and the next day take out that taint, and taint it anew with the salue or ointment taught in the chap. of the shakell gall, renewing it euery day once vntil it be whole keeping alwaies the mouth of the sore as open as you may, to the intent that it heale not vppe too fast, and let not the horse in any wet, nor trauell, vntill he be perfectly whole. Of the Quitter-bone. QVitter-bone is a round hard swelling vpon the cronet of the hoofe, betwixt the hoofe and the quarter, and for the most part, groweth on the inside of the foot: the origy∣nall effect therof is the fretting of grauell vnderneath the shooe, which bruiseth the heele, Markham. or else by meanes of some stub, or the pricking of some naile, through the paine whereof the grissell is loosened, breeding euill humors, which be indeede the ground of the Quit∣ter-bone: it is to be known by the horsses halting, and by the apparant swelling to the eie of that part, which in 3. or 4. daies will grow vnto a head and breake, euacuating great a∣boundance of filthy matter at a little hole, the cure is thus. Take a hot yron, made in fashi∣on of a knife, and with it burne out the flesh, in compasse of a Moone till you come to feele the grissell, then burne it out too: then take Vardigrease, fresh Butter, and Tar mol∣ten together, and dippe fine Tow therein, stop vp the hole, then lay thereon a Sear-cloth of Deere-sewet and wax, and so let him rest for the first day: the next day, take of Melrosa∣rum, oyle of roses, wax, and Turpentine, of each like quantity, infuse them al on the fire together, and with the salue dresse the sore morning and euening, till it be whole. But if you find any proud flesh to grow, then forget not to lay thereon some red lead, or Vardi∣grease: and withall, haue an especiall regard, that the vpper part of the wound, heale not faster then the bottom, for feare of fistulating. Of the Grauelling. THis is a fretting vnder the foot, most commonly in the inside, Blundevile and sometime in the outside, and sometime in both sides together of the heele. It commeth by meanes of little grauell stones getting betwixt the hooue, or calking, or spunge of the shooe, which by continuall labor and treading of the Horse, doth eat into the quicke, and the ra∣ther, if his heele be soft and weake, or that the shooe doe lye flat to his foot, so as the gra∣uell being once gotten in, cannot get out. The signes be these. The horse will halt, and co∣uet to tread all vppon the toe, to fauour his heele. The cure according to Martin is thus. First pare the hooue, and get out the grauel with a cornet, or drawer, leauing none behind for if you doe, it will breede to a quitterbone. That done, stop him with Turpentine and hogs-grease molten together, and layd on with a Towe or flax, and then clap on the shooe to keepe in the stopping, renewing it euery day once vntill it bee whole. And suffer the horse to come in no wet, vntill he be throughly whole. If a grauelling be not well stopt to keepe downe the flesh, ir wil rise higher then the hooue, and not onely require more bu∣sinesse in bolstering it, but also put the horse to more paine. Of grauelling. GRavelling is a hurt will make a horse to halt, and commeth of grauell and little stones, Markham. that goeth betweene the shooe and the hearte of the foote, the cure is: take off the shooe, and let him be well pared, then set on the shooe againe, and stop it with Pitch, Ro∣zen, and Tallow, and this shall help. Of Surbating. THis is a beating of the Hooue against the ground, called of the Italians Sobatitura, it commeth somtime by means of euill shooing, lying too flat to his foote, or by going barefoote, and sometime by the hardnesse of the grounde, and high lifting of the Horse. And those Horsses that bee flat footed, the coffins whereof are tender and weake, are most commonly subiect to this sorance. The signes be these: the Horse will halt on both his forelegs, and goe stifely and creeping, as though he were halfe foundered. The cure, according to Martin is thus: take off his shooes, pare him as little as may bee, and if the shooes be not easie, that is to say, long, large, and hollow inough, then make them so, and then tacke them on againe with foure or fiue Nailes. That done, stop his feete with branne, and Hogs-greace boyled together, so hot as may be, and also couer all the coffin round about with the same, binding all in together with a cloath, and a list fastened about the ioynt, renewing it euery day once, vntill it bee whole, and giue the Horsse during that while warme water, and let him stand dry and warme, and not be trauelled, vntil he be whole. Of a pricke in the sole of the foote, by treading on a naile, or any other sharpe thing that doth enter into the foote. THe signes be these. If a man be on his backe when he treadeth on any such thing, he shall feele that the Horsse will lift vp his foot, and couet to stand still to haue helpe. And if it chaunce at any other time, Blundevile the halting of the Horse, and the hurt it selfe will shew. The cure according to Martin is thus. Pull off the shooe, and pare the foote, and with a drawer vncouer the hole, making the mouth so broade as a two penny peece, then tacke on the shooe againe. That done, stop it, by powring into the hole Turpentine and Hogs-greace molten together, and lay some flaxe, or Towe vpon it, and then stop all the Horsses foote with Horse-dung, or rather with Cow-dung, if you can get it, and splent it either with stickes, or else with an old shooe sole, so as the stopping may abide in, renewing it euery day once vntill it be whole, and let the Horsse come in no wet. If this be not well cured, or looked to in time it will cause the hooue to breake aboue, and to loosen round about, and perhaps to fall cleane away. But if you see that it begins to break aboue, then make a greater yssue beneath by opening the hole wider, and taking more of the sole away, that the flesh may haue the more liberty. Then take of bole Armony halfe a quar∣terne, Beane-flower, and two Egges. Beate them, and mingle them well together, and make a plaister thereof vpon Towe, and lay it round about the cronet, bind it fast on, and so let it remaine the space of two daies, and then renew it againe, not failing so to do euery two daies vntill you see it waxe hard and firme aboue. For this plaister being restrictiue, will force the humors to resort all downeward, which must be drawne out with Turpentin and Hogs greace as before, vntill it leaue mattering, and then dry it vp with burnt Alum, beaten to powder, and strowed vpon it, with a little Flaxe laid againe vpon that, continu∣ing so to do euery day once, vntil it be hardened, and let not the Horse come in any wet, vntil he be whole. Of accloyd or prickt. ACcloyd is a hurt that commeth of shooing, when a Smith driueth a Naile in the quicke, rkham. which will make him to halt, and the cure is, to take off the shoo, and to cut the hoofe away, to lay the sore bare: then lay to it wax, Turpentine, and Deere-sewet which wil heale it. Of the Figge. IF a Horse hauing receiued any hurt, as before is said by nail, bone, splent, or stone, or otherwise in the sole of his foot, and not be well dressed and perfectly cured, there will grow in that place a certaine superfluous piece of flesh, like a Figge: and it will haue little grains in it like a fig, and therefore is rightly called of the Italians Vn fico, that is to say a fig. The cure whereof according to Martin is thus. Cutte it cleane away with a hot iron, and keepe the flesh downe with Turpentine, hogs greace, and a little wax laid on with Towe or flax, and stop the hole hard, that the flesh rise not, renewing it once a day, vntil it be whole. Of a Retreat. T His is the pricking of a naile, not wel driuen in the shooing, and therefore pulled out againe by the Smith, and is called of the Italians, Tratta messa. The cause of the pricking may be partly, the rash driuing of the Smith, and partly the weakenes of the naile, or the hollownes of the naile in the shank. For if it be too weake, the point many times bendethawry into the quicke when it should go right forth. It slatteth and shiuereth in the driuing into two parts, wher∣of one part raceth the quick in pulling out, or else perhaps breaketh cleane assunder, and so remaineth stil behind, and this kinde of pricking is worse than the cloyeng because it wil ranckle worse, by reason of the flaw of yron remaining in the flesh. The signes bee these. If the Smith that driueth such a naile be so lewd, as he wil not looke vnto it before the horse depart, then there is no way to know it, but by the halting of the horse, and ser∣ching the hooue first with a hammer by knocking vpon euery clinging. For when you knock vpon that naile, where the greefe is. The horse wil shrinke vp his foote. And if that wil not seru, then pinch or gripe the hooue with a paire of pinsons round about vntil you haue found the place greeued. The cure according to Martin is thus. First pul off the shooe, and then open the place greeued with a butter or drawer, so as you may perceiue by feeling or seeing, whether there be any peece of naile or not, if there be, to pul it out, and to stop the hole with Turpentine, Wax and Sheepes sewet moulten together, and so poured hot into the hole, and then lay a little Towe vppon it, and clap on the shooe a∣gaine, renewing it thus euery day, vntil it be whole, during which time, let not the horse come in any wet, and it must be so stopped, though it be but prickt without any peece of naile remaining. And if for lack of loking to it in time, this retreat cause the houe to break aboue, then cure it with the plaister restrictiue in such order as is mentioned in the laste place sauing one before this, Of Cloying. CLoying is the pricking of a whole naile called of the Italians Inchiodatura, passinge through the quicke, and remaining stil in the same, and is clenched as other nailes be, and so causeth the horse to halt. The greeued place is knowne, by searching with the hammer and pinsons, as is before said: If the horse halt immediately, then pul off his shooe, and open the hole, vntil it begin to bleed, and stop it with the ointment aforesaid, in the same page of the Retreat, and clap on the shooe againe, and the hooue may be so good, and the harme so little, as you may trauel him immediately vppon it: but if it bee ranckled, then renew the stopping euery day once, let him come in no wet, vntil it bee whole. Of loosening the hooue. T His is a parting of the hooue from the cronet, called of the Italians, Dis∣solatura del vnghia, which if it be round about, it commeth by meanes of foundering, if in part, then by the anguish caused by the pricking of the canel naile, piercing the sole of the foot, or by some quitterbone, Retreat, Grauelling, or Cloying, or such like thing: The signes be these. When it is loosened by foundering, then it will breake first in the fore-part of the Cronet, right a∣against the toes, because the humor doth couet alwaies to descend towards the toe. A∣gaine when the pricking of a canel naile or such like cankered thing is the cause, then the hooue wil loosen round about, equally euen at the first. But when it proceedeth of any of the other hurts last mentioned: then the hooue wil breake right aboue the place that is offended, and most commonly wil proceed no further. The cure, according to Martin, is thus. First, of which soeuer of these causes it proceeds, be sure to open the hoofe in the sole of the foot, so as the humor may haue free passage downeward, and then restraine it aboue with the plaister restrictiue before mentioned, and in such order as is there writ∣ten, and also heale vp the wound, as is before taught in the chap. of a pricke in the sole of the foot. Of casting the hooue. THis is when the coffin falleth clean away from the foot, which commeth by such cau∣ses as were last rehearsed, and is so aparant to the eie, as it needeth no signes to know it. The cure, according to Martin is thus. Take of Turpentine one pound, of Tarre halfe a pinte, of vnwrought Wax halfe a pinte. Boile all these thinges together, and stirre them continually vntil they be throughly mingled, and compact together. Then make a boote of leather with a good strong sole meete for the horses feet, to be laced or buckled about the pasterne, and dresse his foot with the salue aforesaid laid vpon flaxe or Tow, and bol∣ster or stuffe his foot with soft flaxe, so as the boot may greeue him no manner of waye, renewing it euery day once vntill it be whole, and then put him to grasse. Of the hooue bound. T His is a shrinking of all the whole hooue. It commeth by drought, for the hoous perhaps are kept to dry, when the horse standeth in the stable, and sometime by meanes of heate, Blundevile or of ouerstraight shooing. The Italians call the horse thus greeued Incastellado. The signes be these, The horse wil hault, and the hooues be hotte, and if you knocke on them with a hammer, they wil sound hollow like an empty bottle, and if both the feet be not hooue-bound, the sore foot will be lesser than the other indeed, and appeare so to the eie. The cure according to Martin is thus. Pull off the shooes, and shooe him with halfe moone-shooes called Lunette, the order and shape wherof you shall find among the Ferrers, and rase both the quarters of the hooue with a drawer, from the coronet vnto the sole of the foot, so deepe as you shall see the dew it selfe come forth. And if you make two rases on each side, it shall be so much the better, and inlarge the hooue the more. That done, an∣noint all the hooue about, next vnto the coronet round about, with the ointment pres∣cribed before in the chapter of casting the hooue continuing so to do euery day once vn¦til he begin to amend for the space of a moneth, and if he goeth not well at the months ende, then take off the halfe shooes and pare all the soles, and frushes, and all so thinne as you may see the deaw come forth, and tacke on a whole shoo, and stop al the foot with∣in with hogs greace and bran boiled together, and laide hot to the foot, renewing it dai∣ly once the space of nine daies, to the intent the sole may rise. But if this will do no good then take away the sole cleane and clap on a whole shoe, and stop the foot with nettles and salt brayed together, renewing it once a day but not ouer hard, to the intent the sole may haue liberty to rise, and being growne againe, let him be shod with the lunets, and sent to grasse. Of the running Frush. T He Frush is the tenderest part of the hooue towardes the heele, cal∣led of the Italians Fettone, and because it is fashioned like a forked head, the French men cal it Furchette, which word our Ferrers, ei∣ther for not knowing rightly how to pronounce it, or else perhaps for easinesse sake of pronuntiation, do make it a monasillable, & pro¦nounce it the Frush, in which Frush breedeth many times a roten∣nesse or corruption proceeding of humours that commeth out of the legge, whereby the legge is kept cleane from the windgals and all other humours and swellings by meanes that the humors haue passage that way. Not∣withstanding the discommodity of the sorance is greater than the commodity, because it maketh the horses feet so weak and tender▪ as he is not able to tred vpon any hard ground The signes be these. The horse wil hauls, and specially when the passage of the humour is stopt with anye grauel gathered in the Frush, and not being stopt it wil continually runne, the sauour whereof wil bee so strong as a man is not able to abide it, and in some places it wil looke raw. The cure according to Martin is thus. First take off the shooe and pare away all the corrupt places and make them raw, so as you may see the water yssue out of the raw pla∣ces, then tack on the shooe againe, being first made wide and large inough. That done, take of foote one handfull, of salte as much, bruse them well togither in a dish, and putte thereunto the white of three Egges, and temper them togither, and with a little Towe dipt therein, stop all the foote and especially the Frush, and splent is so as it may not fall out, renewing it once a day the space of seuen daies, and then he will bee whole. During which time let the horse rest, and come in no wet, at the seauen daies end leaue stopping him, and ride him abroad, and alwaies when he commeth in, let his sore foote be cleane washed, that no grauell remaine therein, without doing any more vnto him. Of the Frush. THe Frush is the tendrest part of the sole of the foot, which by humors distilling ma∣ny times downe from the legges, occasion inflamations in that part, Markham. which may ea∣sily be perceiued by the impostumation of the same: the cure is, first hauing taken off the shooe, pare away all the corrupted and naughty matter, vntil the sore looke rawe, then naile on a hollow shooe made for the same purpose, and take of soote a handeful, of the iuyce of House-licke and of Creame with the white of an Egge or two, as much as wil thicken the same: with this stop vp the sore, and splint it, so as it may not fal out, re∣newing it vntil it be whole: but during the cure, haue regard that the sore foot touch not any wet, for that is very much hurtfull. Of diseases or griefes indifferently incident to any part of the body, but first of the Leprosie or vniuersall man∣ginesse, called of the old writers Elephantia. THis is a cankered manginesse, spreading ouer all the body, which commeth of a∣bundance of melancholy, corrupt and filthy blood. The signes be these, The horse will be al maungy and scuruy, ful of scabs, and rawe plots about the necke, and e∣uil fauoured to looke on, and alwayes rubbing and scratching. The cure according to Martin is thus. Let him blood the first day in the one side of the necke, and within 2. daies after that, in the flanke vaines, and last of all, in the vaine vnder the taile. Then wash all the sore places with salt brine, and rubbing them hard with a wispe of strawe hard twisted, so as they may bleed well, and be all raw. That doue, annoint the place with this ointment: take of Quicke-siluer one ounce, of Hogges-greace one pound, of Brimstone beaten into powder a quarterne, of Rape oyle a pinte. Mingle these thinges well together, vntill the Quicke-siluer be throughly incorporated with the rest, and hauing annointed all the raw places with this ointment, make it to sinke into the flesh, by holding and weauing vp and downe ouer it, a hot broad barre of yron, and then touch him no more againe, the space of two or three daies, during which time, if you see that he rubbeth still in any place, then rub that place againe with an old horse-combe, to make it raw, and annoint it with fresh ointment. But if all this will not helpe, then with a hot yron and blunt at the point, so big as a mans little finger, burne all the mangy places, making round holes, passing only tho∣rough the skin, and no further. For which intent it shall be needefull to pull the skinne first from the flesh, with your left hand, holding it still vntil you haue thrust the hot yron thorough it, and let euery hole bee a spanne off one from another, and if neede be, you may annoint those holes with a little sope, and let the horse be thinne dieted, during his curing time. Of the Farcin, called in Italian of some, Il verme, and of some Farcina. THis is a kind of creeping vlcer growing in knots, following along some veine, and it proceedeth of corrupt blood ingendred in the body, or else of some outward hurt, as of spurgalling, or the biting of some other horse, or of biting of ticks, or of hogs lice, or such like causualties: Or if it be in the legges, it may come by interferring. It is easilye knowne, partly by the former description, and also it is apparant to the eie. The cure, ac∣cording to Martin is thus. Let him bloud in that vaine where it commeth, as nigh the sore place as may be, and let him bleed well, then fire euery knot one by one, taking the knot in your left hand, and pulling it so hard as you can from his body to the intent you maye the better pierce the knot, with a blunt hot yron, of the bignesse of a mans fore-finger, without doing the body any hurt, & let out the mater, leauing none vnburnd, be it little or much. That done, annoint euery knot so burned with Hogges-greace warmed euery day once, vntill the coares be ready to fall away, and in the meane time prepare a good quan∣tity of old Vrine, and when you see the coares ready to fal, boile the vrine, and put there∣in a little Coporas and salt, and a few strong nettles, and with that water being warm, wash out all the coares and the corruption. That done, fill euery hole immediately with the powder of slect lime, continuing thus to do euery day once, vntill the holes be closed vp, and if any be more ranker than other, fill those with Verdigrease, and during this cure, let the horse be thinly dieted, that is to say with straw and water onely, vnlesse it be nowe and then to giue him a loafe or breade. For the lower he be kept, the sooner he will be whole. And in any wise let his necke be yo∣ked in an olde bottomelesse paile, or else with short staues to keepe him from licking the sores, and the lesse rest he hath the better. Or do thus. Take a good great Dock-root clean scraped, and cutte thereof fiue little rundels or cakes to be vsed as followeth. First with a knife make a slit right down in the horses forhed three inches longe, then with a Cornet loosen the skinne within the flesh, so as you may easily put therein fiue rundels of Docke, that is to say, two on each side of the slit one aboue another, and put the fift rundle in the very midst betwixt the other foure: that done, fasten to each of the slits two short shoo-makers ends, to serue as laces to tie in the foresaide rundles, so as they may not fall out, and clense the sore euery day once, for the vertue of the root is such, as it will draw al the filthy matter from any part of the body: yea, though the Farcin be in the hinder Legges, which matter is to be wiped away from time to time, and new rootes to be thrust into the the slit according as you see it needefull. Of the Farcion. THe Farcion is a vilde disease, ingendred of ill bloud, flegmaticke matter, and vn∣kindly feeding, it appeareth in a horse like vnto little knottes in the flesh, as bigge as a Hasell Nutte, Markham. the knottes will encrease daily and inflame, impostume, and breake and when the knots amount to threescore, they wil euery night after breed so many more till they haue ouer-runne the horses bodye, and with the poison, which is mighty and also strong, soone bring gim to his death: This disease is very infectious and dangerous for some horses, yet if it be taken in any time it is easie to be holpen: the cure thereof is in this manner. Take a sharpe Bodkin and thrust it through the neather part of his nose, that he may bleede: or if you will to let him bloude in the necke-vaine shall not be amisse: then feele the knots, and as many as are soft launce them and let them runne, then take strong Lye, Lime, and Allum, and with the same bath all his sores, and it shall in short space cure him. There is also another manner of curing this disease, and that is thus: Take a sharpe launce-knife, and in the top of the horses forehead, iust betweene his eies, make a long slit euen to the scull: then with a blunt instrument for the purpose lose the flesh from the scalp a pretty compasse: then take Carret-rootes cut into little thinne round pieces, and putte them betweene the skinne and the scull, as many as you can, then close vp the wound, and once a daie annoint it with fresh Butter: This is a most sure and approued way to cure the Farcion, for looke how this wound thus made, shall rot, waste, and grow sound, so shall the Farcion breake, drie vp, and be healed, because all the poison that feedeth the disease shall be altogether drawne into the fore-head, where it shall die and waste away. The onely fault of this cure is, it will be somwhat long, and it is a foule eie-sore vntil it be whole. Some vse to burne this sorance, but that is naught and dangerous, as who so proues it shal find. A most approued medicine to cure the Farcion. TAke of Aqua-vitae two spoonfuls, of the iuyce of hearbe of grace as much, Markham. mingle them together, then take of plegants or Bals of Flax or Toe and steepe them there∣in, and stop them hard into the Horses eares, then take a needle and a thread, and stitch the tips of his two eares together, by meanes whereof he cannot shake out the me¦dicine, and vse him thus but three seuerall mornings, and it will kill any Farcion whatso∣euer, for it hath bin often approued. Another medicine of the same. SLit euery hard kernell with a sharpe knife, and fill the hole with an ointment made of old Lard, Sope, and gray Salt, for that will eat out the coare, and cause it to rot, and so fall out of the one accord. Of the Canker, called of the Italian Il Canero. A Canker is a filthy creeping vlcer, fretting and gnawing the flesh in gret breadth. In the beginning it is knotty, much like a Farcine, Blundevile and sprea∣deth it selfe into diuers places, and being exulcerated, gathereth togi∣ther in length into a wound or sore. This proceedeth of a melancholy and filthy blood ingendered in the body, which if it be mixt with Salt humors, it causeth the more painefull and greeuous exulceration, and sometime it commeth of some filthy wound that is not cleanly kept, the corrupt matter whereof cankereth other clean parts of the body. It is easie to be knowne by the descrip∣tion before. The cure whereof, according to Martin is thus. Frst let him blood in those vaines that be next the sore, and take inough of him. Then take of Alum halfe a pound of greene Coporas and of white Coporas of each one quarterne, and a good handfull of Salt: boile all these things togither in faire running water, from a pottle to a quart. And this water being warme, wash the sore with a cloath, and then sprinkle thereon the pow∣der of vnslecked lime, continuing so to do euery day once the space of fifteen daies: and if you see that the lime do not mortifie the ranke flesh, and keepe it from spreading any fur∣ther then take of blacke Sope halfe a pounde, of Quicke-siluer halfe an ounce, and beate them together in a pot, vntill the Quicke-siluer be so well mingled with the Sope, as you can perceiue none of the Quicke-siluer in it. And with an yron slice, after that you haue washed the sore with the stronge water aforesaide, couer the wound with this ointment, continuing thus to do euery day once, vntill the Canker leaue spreading abroad. And if it leaue spreading, and that you see the ranke flesh is mortified, and that the edges begin to gather a skin, then after the washing, dresse it with the lime as before, continuing so to vntil it be whole. And in the dressing, suffer no filth that commeth out of the sore, to re∣maine vppon any whole place about, but wipe it cleane away, or else wash it away with warme water. And let the horse during this cure, be as thinly dieted as may be, and tho∣roughly exercised. Of the Fistula called of the Italians Fistula. A Fistula is a deepe hollowe crooking vlcer, and for the most part springes of maligne humors, ingendered in some wound, sore, or canker, not throughly healed. It is ea∣sie to know by the description before. The cure according to Martin is thus. Firste, search the depth of it with a quill, or with some other instrument of lead, that may be bo∣wed euery way, meet for the purpose. For vnlesse you find the bottome of it, it wil be very hard to cure: And hauing found the bottome, if it be in such a place as you may boldely cut and make the way open with a launcet or rasor, then make a slit right against the bot∣tome, so as you may thruste in your finger, to feele whether there be any bone or gristle perished, or spungy or loose flesh, which must be gotten out, and then taint it with a taint of flaxe dipt in this ointment. Take of hony a quarterne, and of Verdigrease one ounce beaten into powder. Boile them together, vntill it looke redde, stirring it continually, least it runne ouer, and being luke warme, dresse the taint wherewith, and bolster the taint with a bolster of flax. And if it be in such a place, as the taint cannot conueniently be kept in with a band, then fasten on each side of the hole, two ends of Shoomakers thread right ouer the bolster to keepe in the taint, which ends may hang there as two laces, to tye and vntie at your pleasure, renewing the taint euery day once vntill the sore leaue mattering. And then make the taint euery day lesser and lesser, vntill it be whole. And close it vp in the end, by sprinckling thereon a little slect lime. But if the Fistula be in such a place as a man can neither cut right against the bottome, or nigh the same: then there is no reme∣dy, but to poure in some strong water, through some quill, or such like thing, so as it may goe to the very bottome, and dry vp all the filthy matter, dressing him so twice a day, vn∣till the horse be whole. Of an Aubury. THis is a great spungy Wart full of blood, called of the Italians, Moro, or Selfo, which may grow in any place of the body, and it hath a root like a Cocks stone. The cure ac∣cording to Martin is thus. Tie it with a thred, so hard as you can pull it, the thred will eate by little and little in such sort, as within seauen or eight daies, it will fall away by it selfe. And if it be so flat as you can binde nothing about it, then take it away with a sharpe hotte yron, cutting it round about, and so deepe as you may leaue none of the root behind, and dry it with Verdigreace. Russius saith, that if it grow in a place full of sinnewes, so as it can∣not be conueniently cut away with a hot yron, then it is good to eat out the core with the powder of Resalgar, and then to stop the hole with flax dipt in the white of an Egge for a day or two, and lastly, to drie it vp with the powder of vnslect lime and hony, as before is taught. Of Wounds. VVOunds commeth by meanes of some stripe or pricke, and they are properly called wounds, when some whole part is cut or broken. For a wound accor∣ding to the Phisitians, is defined to be a solution diuision, or parting, of the whole; For if there be no solution or parting, then methinkes it ought rather to be cal∣led a bruse then a wound. And therfore wounds are most commonly made with sharpe or piercing weapons, and bruses with blunt weapons. Notwithstanding, if by such blunt wea∣pons, anie part of the whole be euidently broken, then it ought to be called a wound as wel as the other: Of wounds some be shallow, and some be deepe and hollow: Againe, some chance in the fleshy partes, and some in the bonye and sinnewie places: And those that chaunce in the fleshy parts, though they be verie deepe, yet they be not so dangerous as the other, and therefore we will speak first of the most dangerous: If a horse haue a wound newly made, either in his heade, or in any other place that is full of sinnewes, bones, or gristles: first Martin would haue you to wash the wounde well with white wine warmed: That done to search the bottome of the wound with some instrument meete for the pur∣pose, suffering it to take as little winde in the meane while as may be. Then hauing found the depth, stop the hole close with a clout, vntill your salue be rea∣die: Then take of Turpentine of Mel Rosatum, of Oile of Roses, of each a quarterne, and a little vnwrought Waxe, and melt them together, and if it be a cut, make a handsome rol of cleane picked Towe, so long and so bigge as may fill the bottome of the wound, which for the most part is not so wide as the mouth of the wound: then make another role grea∣ter than that to fill vp the rest of the wounde, euen to the harde mouth, and let both these rolles be annointed with the ointment aforesaid Luke-warm. But if the hurt be like a hole made with some pricke, then make a stiffe taint, such a one as may reach the bottome, an∣nointed with the aforesaid ointment, and bolster the same with a little Towe: And if the mouth be not wide inough, so as the matter may easily runne forth, if it be in such place you may do it without hurting anie sinnew, then giue it a pretie slit from the mouth down¦ward, that the matter may haue the freer passage, and in anie wise haue a speciall regarde, that the taint may be continually kept in by one meanes or other, as by binding or staying the seine with the ends of shoomakers thread as is aforesaid. And if the hole be deep, & in such place as you may not cut it, then make your taint of a spunge, and so long as it may reach to the bottom, and the taint being made somewhat full, with continuall turning and wrying of it, you shall easily get it downe, and then dresse the wound with this twice a day, clensing the wound euery time with a little white wine lukewarm. For this spunge, anoin∣ted with the ointment aforesaid, will both draw and suck vp all the filthy matter, and make it so faire within as is possible: and as it beginneth to heale, so make your taint euery day lesser and lesser, vntill it be ready to close vp, and neuer leaue tainting it, so long as it will receiue a taint, be it neuer so short. For hasty healing of woundes breedeth Fistulas, which properly be old wounds, and therefore must be cured like Fistulas. Of wounds in the fleshy parts. VSe the same ointment and maner of proceeding as before. And if the wound be large then to keep in the taint or roles, you shal be fain to put two or 3. shoomakers ends on each side of the sore, leauing them so long as you may tye them together, and loosen them when you will like laces. Of old Vlcers or wounds. TO cure an old Vlcer, as Fistula, Gall, or Botch or any new receiued wound, these are the best salues and most approued in mine experience: take of hony halfe a pinte, of Deeresewet two ounces, of Vardigrease beaten into powder as much, boyle al these ex∣ceeding wel vpon the fire, then with the same lukewarme, taint or plaister any venemous sore, and it wil recure it. If you take of wax, Turpentine, oyle of Roses, of hogs-grease, of each like quantity, and halfe so much Tar as any one of the other simples, melt al these to∣gether, and being well incorporated together, either taint or plaister any wound, and it will heale it. Also, if you take the greene leaues of Tobacco bruised, and put them into a greene wound, they will heale it: the ashes of Tobacco burnt, if they be strewed vpon a∣nye sore that is neere skinning, it will also skin it perfectly, and it will incarnate well, if the vlcer be not too deepe and dangerous. There bee many other salues, plaisters, and vn∣guents which I could set downe, but since I haue experienced these for most effectuall I omit the others as superfluous. Of an hurt with an arrow. IF the horse be hurt with an arrow, taint the hole with hogs grease and Turpentine mol∣ten together, renewing it euery day once vntil it be whole. Of pulling out shiuers or thornes. MArtin saith, that if it bee not very deepe, sope being laid vnto it al night will make it to appear, so as you may pul it out with a paire of nippers. But if it be very deep then you must open the place with a knife or lancet, and get it out, and afterward heale vp the wound as hath beene taught you before. Russius saith, that the rootes of reed being stampt and mingled with hony will draw out any thorne, or shiuer: and so will snailes, as he saith, being stampt and wrought with fresh butter, and if the place be swollen, he saith it is good to mollifie it with Hogs-grease and hony, which wil asswage any new swelling, that com∣meth by stripe or otherwise. Of bruisings or swellings. MArtin saith▪ First prick it with a fleame. Then take of wine lees a pint, as much wheat-flower as will thicken it, and an ounce of cumin. Boile them together, and lay this somewhat warme vnto it renewing it euery day once vntill the swelling either departe or else come to a head. And if it do, then lance it, and heale it vp as a wound. Of sinnewes cut, prickt, or bruised. Blu evile TAke of Tar, and Bean-flower, and a little oile of Roses, and lay it hot vnto the place. And if this do no good, then take Wormes and sallet-oile fryed together, or else the ointment of worms, which you shall haue at the Apothecaries, and one of these will knit ir againe, if it be not cleane asunder. How to cure a wound made with harquebush-shot. MArtin saith. First seeke with an instrument whether the pellet remain within or not, and if it do, you must get it out with an instrument meete for the purpose. Then to kill the fire. Take a little vernish, and thrust it into the wound with a feather, an∣nointing it well within with the feather, and after that, stop the mouth faire and softly with a little soft flax, to keepe the wind out, and on the outside, charge all the swelling with this charge: take of bole Armony a quarterne, of Lineseede beaten into fine powder halfe a pound, of beane flower as much, and three or 4. broken egges, shels and all, and of Tur∣pentine a quarterne, and a quart of vineger, and mingle them well together ouer the fire, and being somewhat warme, charge all the sore place with part thereof, and immediatly clap a cloth, or a piece of leather vpon it, to keepe the wound from the cold aire, continu∣ing both to annoint the hole within with vernish, and also to charge the swelling without, the space of foure or fiue daies, and at the fiue daies end, leaue annointing of it, and taint it with a taint reaching to the bottom of the wound, and dipped in Turpentine and hogs-grease molten together, renewing it euery day twice vntill it bee throughly killed, which you shall perceiue by the mattering of the wound, and by falling of the swelling: for so long as the fire hath the vpper hand, no thicke matter will yssue out, but onely a thin yello∣wish water, neither will the swelling asswage. And then take of Turpentine, washed in nine seuerall waters, halfe a pound, and put thereon three yolkes of egges, and a little Saffron, and taint it with that ointment, renewing it euery day once vntill the wound be whole. Of burning with Lime, or any other fiery thing. MArtin saith. First wash away the Lime, if there bee any, with warme water. Then kill the fire with oyle and Water beaten together, dressing him so euery daye vntill it be all raw, and then annoint it with hogs grease, and strew thereupon the powder of slec∣ked lime, dressing him so euery day once vntill it be whole. Of the biting of a mad Dog. IF a Horse be bitten with a mad dog, the venom of his teeth will not onely paine him ex∣treamely, but also infect all his blood, and make him to dye mad. The cure according to the old writers is thus. Take of Goats dung, of flesh that hath laide long in salt, and of the herbe Ebulus, called of some Danewort, of each halfe a pound, and xl. walnuts. Stamp all these things together, and lay thereof vnto the sore, and this will sucke out the venom, and heale the wound. It is good also to giue the Horse Treacle, and Wine to drinke: yea, and some would haue the sore place to be fiered with a hot iron. Of hurts by tuskes of a Boare. IF a horse be hurt with the tuske of a Boare, lay Vitriol, and Coporas thereunto, and the powder of a dogs head being burned, but let the tong be first pulled out and cast away. To heale the biting or stinging of Serpents. LAurentius Russius saith. Take a good quantity of the herb called Sanicula, stamp it, and distemper it with the milke of a Cowe, that is all of one colour, and giue him that to drinke, and that will heale him. Another medicine for the same purpose. MAke a plaister of Onions, hony and salt, stampt and mingled together, and lay that to the sore place, and giue the horse wine, and treacle to drink. Absirtus would haue you to giue him white Pepper, Rue, and Time, to drinke with wine. Of drinking of horseleaches. IF a Horse chance to drinke horseleaches, they will continually sucke his bloud, and kill him. The remedy, according to Absirtus, is to poure oyle into the Horses mouth which will make them to fall away and kill them. Of swallowing downe hens dung. IF a horse swallow downe hens dung in his hay, it will fret his guts, and make him to void filthy matter at the fundament. For remedy whereof, Absirtus would haue you to giue him drinke made of smallage seede, wine, and hony, and to walke him throughly vpon it, that he may empty his belly. Of Lice, and how to kill them THey be like Geese Lice, but somewhat bigger, they will breede most about the eares, necke, and taile, and ouer all the body. They come of pouerty, Blundevile and the horse will bee alwaies rubbing, and scratching, and will eate his meate, and not prosper withall, and with rubbing he will breake all his mane, and taile. The cure according to Martin is thus. An∣noint the place with sope and quicksiluer, well mingled together, and to a pound of sope, put halfe an ounce of quicksiluer. Of Lousinesse THere be Horsses that will be Lousie, and it commeth of pouerty, cold, and il keeping, Markham. and it is oftnest amongst young horses, and most men take little heed vnto it, and yet they will dye thereon, the cure is, to wash them three mornings together in Stau-aker and warme water. How to saue horsses from the stinging of flies in Summer. ANnoint the Horsses coat with oyle, and Bay berries, mingled together, or tie to the headstall of his collar, a sponge dipt in strong vineger, or sprinkle the stable with wa∣ter, wherein hearb Grace hath bin laid in steepe, or perfume the stable with Iuie, or with Calomint, or with Gith burned in a pan of coles. Of bones being broken out of ioynt. FEw or none of our Ferrers do intermeddle with any such griefes, but do refer it ouer to the bone setter, whose practised hand, I must needes confesse, to be needful in such businesse. Notwithstanding, for that it belongeth to the Ferrers art, and also for that the old writers do make some mention therof, I thought good not to passe it ouer altogither with silence. Albeit, they speake odlye of fractures in the legs beneath the knee. For they make little mention or none of bones aboue the knee, taking them to be incurable, vnlesse it be a rib, or such like. If a bone then be broken in the leg, it is easie to perceiue, by fee∣ling the roughnesse and inequality of the place grieued, one part being higher then ano∣ther: the cure whereof, according to Absirtus, and Hierocles, is in this sorte. First, put the bone againe into his right place. That done, wrap it about with vnwasht wooll, binding it fast to the leg with a small linnen roller, soked before in Oyle and vine∣ger mingled together And let that roller be laid on, as euen as is possible, and vpon that lay againe more wooll, dipt in oyle and vineger, and then splent it with three splents, binding them fast at both ends with a thong, and let the horses leg be kept straight, and right out, the space of forty daies and let not the bonds be loosened aboue 3. times in twenty daies, vnlesse it shrinke, and so require to be new drest, and bound again. But faile not euery day once, to poure on the sore place, through the splentes, oyle and vineger, mingled toge∣ther. And at the forty daies end, if you perceiue that the broken place be sowdered toge∣ther again with some hard knob or gristle: then loosen the bonds, so as the horse may go faire and softly, vsing from that time forth to annoint the place with some soft greace or ointment. Of broken bones. I Haue not for mine owne part had any great experience in broken bones of a Horse, be∣cause it chanceth seldom, Markham. and when it doth chance, what through the horses brutish vn∣rulinesse, and the immoderate maner of the act, it is almost held incurable, yet for the lit∣tle experience I haue, I haue not found for this purpose any thing so soueraine or absolut good, as oyle of Mandrag, which applyed, conglutinateth and bindeth together any thing especially bones being either shiuered, or broken. Of bones out of ioynt. I F a Horses knee or shoulder be clean out of ioynt, and no bone broken, Mar∣tin saith the readiest way is, Blundevile to bind all the foure legs together, in such sort as hath bin taught before in the chap. of incording, and then to hoise the Horsse somewhat from the ground, with his heeles vpward, so shal the weight and peise of his body, cause the ioynt to shoot in again into the right place: for by this means he pleasured not long since a friend and neighbor of his, who going with his cart from S. Albo s▪ towards his owne house, his Thiller fell and put his shoulder cleane out of ioynt, so as he was neither able to rise, nor being holpen vp, could stand on his Legs: to which mischance Martin being called, made no more adoe, but taking his friendes Cart-rope, bound the horses legs all 4. together, and with a leuer being staid vpon the Cart-wheele, they putting their shoulders to the other end, hoised vp the horse clean from the ground, the peise of whose body made the bone to returne into his right place, with such a loude k ack or crack, as it might he heard a great way off, and the Horse immediatly had the vse of his leg, so as he drew in the cart, and went also safe home without complaining thereof euer after. Certaine receipts of plaisters, very good for broken bones, taken out of the old Authors, writing of horse-leach-craft. TAke of Spuma argenti, of vineger, of each one pound, of Sallet-oyle halfe a pound, of Amoniacum, and Turpentine, of each 3. three ounces, of waxe, of Rozen, of each two ounces of Bitumen, of Pitch, of Vardigrease, of each halfe a pound. Boile the vineger, oile and Spuma argenti together, vntill it wax thick, then put thereunto the Pitch, which being molten, take the pot from the fire, and put in the Bitumen, without stirring it at al, and that being also molten, then put in al the rest, & set the pot again to the fire, and let them boile al together, vntil they bee all vnited in one. That done, straine it, and make it in a plaister forme, and this is called Hierocles plaister. Another receit for broken bones. TAke of liquid Pitch one pound, of wax two ounces, of the purest & finest part of Fran∣kincense one ounce, of Amoniacum foure ounces, of dry Roses, and of Galbanum, of each one ounce, of vineger two pints. Boile first the vineger and Pitch together, then put in the Amoniacum, dissolued first in vineger, and after that al the rest of the aforesaid drugs and after they haue boyled together, and be vnited in one, straine it, and make it plaister∣wise, and this is called Emplastrum flauum, that is to say, the yellow plaister. An ointment for broken bones. TAke of old Sallet-oile a quart, and put therunto of hogs-grease of Spuma nitri, of each one pound, and let them boile together, vntil it begin to buble aboue, & let this oint∣ment be very warm when you vse it. Hitherto of al the diseases belonging to a horse. Now therefore my promise was made vnto you to speake of those things wherein the cure of al diseases do consist, that is to say, in letting bloud, in taking vp of veines, in purging, and in giuing the fire: yea, and also order it selfe bindeth me to treat of the said things present∣ly, and first of letting blood. In how many veines a horse may be let bloud, and to what end. AS touching the order, time of the yeare, Moone, and day, and other circumstances belonging to letting of blood, we haue sufficiently spoken already in the keepers of∣fice, in the 22. chap. It resteth therefore here to shew you what veines should be opened when the horse is sick of any disease, according to Vegetius opinion. But first I will rehearse vnto you once again, in how many veines a horse may be let blood, and the rather for that I followe Vegetius. A Horse then may bee let blood in the two Temple vaines. Item, in the two eie vaines, which are easie to finde in the face of the horse, somewhat beneath the eies. Item, in the two pallat veines of the mouth. In the two necke vaines. Item in the two plat vaines which bee in the breast. Item, in the two forethigh vaines. Item, in the foure shakell vaines before. Item, in the two toe vains before. Item in the two side veines, which may bee otherwise called flancke veines. Item in the taile veine. Item in the two haunch veines. Item in the two hough veines. Item, in the foure shakell veines behinde. Item, in the two toe veines behind, so that by this accout, a horse may be let blood in 3 , veines. All which veines are easie inough to know, because that euery one lyeth in a little gutter, which by feeling softly with your finger, you shall finde immediatly. And Vegetius saith, that if a Horse be pained with any griefe in his head, as with ach, heauinesse, frenzy, fal∣ling euill, or such like, then it is good to let him blood in the temple veines with a fleame. If his eies be waterish, blodshotten, or grieued with pin, web, or hawe, then it is good to strike the eie veine with a fleame. If he haue any heauinesse or wearinesse of body, or bee diseased in the throat with the strangullion, quinzy, or swelling of the artires, either within or without, then it is good to let him bloud in the mouth, in the palat veines with a Cor∣net. If he be vexed with an Ague, or with any other disease, vniuersally hurting his body, then let him bloud in the necke vaines. If his griefe be in the lungs, liuer, or in any other inward member, then let him blood in the breast veines, which we called before the palat veines. If he be grieued in the shoulder, then let him blood in the forethigh veins, aboue the knee with a lancet, and that very warily, because that place is full of sinnewes, and if he be grieued in his ioynts, then let him bloud in the shakell veines, and that warily, be∣cause that place is also full of sinnewes. And if he be foiled on his forefeet by foundering or otherwise, then let him blood in the toe veins, making way first with your drawer, or cornet in the hoofe to come to the veine. If he bee diseased in the kidnies, reines, backe, or belly, then let him bloud in the flancke veines, and in his taile, if he hath any griefe in his hips, or houghs, then let him blood in the hip or hough veines, and if his hinder legs, ioynts, or feete, be grieued, then let him blood in the shakell veines, and toe veines, as is aforesaid. The order of taking vp vaines, and wherefore it is good. ndevile T He order obserued by Martin is in this sort. First, if the Horsse be very curst and shrewd, then cast him vppon a dunghill, or some straw, then ha∣uing found the veine that you would take vp, marke well that part of the skinne which couereth the veine, and pull that somewhat a side from the veine with your left thumb, to the intent you may slit it with a Rasor, with∣out touching the veine. And cut not no deeper then onely through the skinne, and that longste wise, as the veine goeth, and not aboue an inch long. That done, take away your Thumbe, and the skinne will returne againe into his place, right ouer the veine, as it was before. Then with a cornet vncouer the vaine and make it vp, and heing bare, thrust the cor∣net vnderneath it, and raise it vp, so as you may put a shoomakers thread vnderneath, somewhat higher then the cornet, to knit the vaine when time is. And if your cornet had a hole in the small end to put in the thread, it should be the easlier done. Then the cornet standing so still, slit the vaine longst wise that it may bleede, and hauing bled somewhat from aboue, then knit it vp with a sure knot, somewhat aboue the slit, suf∣fering it to bleed onely from beneath, and hauing bled sufficiently, then knit vp the veine also beneath the slit with a sure knot, and fill the hole of the vein with Salt, and then heale vp the wound of the skinne with Turpentine, and Hogs-grease molten together, and laid on with a little Flax. The taking vp of veines is very necessary, and doth ease many griefes in the Legges: for the taking vp of the forethigh veines easeth Farcins, and swellinges of the Legges, the taking vp of the shakell veines before, easeth the Quitter-bone and swel∣ling of the ioynts, scabs, and cratches. The taking vp of the hinder veines helpeth the Farcin, swellings, and both the spauens, the taking vp of the shakel veines behind, helpeth swelling of the ioynts, the paines, and kibed heeles, and such like diseases. Of purging with Purgation, or Glister. P Vrgations is defined by the Physitians, to be the emptiyng or voiding of superfluous humors, annoying the body with their euill quality. For such humors bring euill iuyce and nutriment, called of the Physitians Cacochimia, which when it will not be corrected or holpen with good dy∣et, alteration, nor by the benefit of nature and kindly heat, then it must needes be taken away by purgation, vomit or Glister. But forasmuch as Horsses are not wont to be purged by Vomit, as men be, I will speake heere onely of Gli∣sters and purgations. And first because a Horse is grieued with many diseases in his guts, and that nothing can purge the guts so well as a Glyster, and especially the thicke guts, I wish that our Ferrers would learne to knowe the diuersity of Glysters to what end they▪ serue, and with what drugs or simples they should bee made, for as the disease requireth, so must the Glister bee made, some to allay griefes and sharpnesse of humors, some to binde, some to loosen, some to purge euill humors, some to clense Vlcers: but our Fer∣rers vse Glisters, only to loosen the belly and for no other purpose: yea, few or none do that vnlesse it be Martin, and such as he hath taught, who is not ignorant that a Glister is the beginning of purgation. For a Glister, by clensing the guts, refresheth the vital parts and prepareth, the way before. And therefore whensoeuer a Horse is surfeted and full of euill humors, needing to be purged and specially being pained in the guts, I would wish you to begin first with a Glister, least by purging him by medicine vppon the sudden, you stir vp a multitude of euill humors, which finding no passage downeward because the guts be stopt with wind and dregges, do strike vpwardes, and so perhaps put the horse in great danger. But now you shall vnderstand that Glisters be made of foure things, that is to say, of de∣coctions, of Drugges, of Oyles, or such like vnctious matters, as butter and soft grease, and fourthly of diuers kindes of salt to prouoke the vertue expulsiue. A decoction is as much to say as the broath of certaine hearbes or simples boiled together in water till the third part be consumed. And sometime instead of such decoction, it shalbe needfull parhaps to vse some fat broth as the broth of Beefe or of Sheeps heads, or Milke, or Whay, or some other such like li∣quor, and that perhaps mingled with Hony, or Sugar, according as the disease shall re∣quire, the Glister to be either Lenitiue, that is to say, easing paine: or Glutinatiue, that is, ioyning together: or else Abstersiue, that is to say, cleansing or wiping away filthy mat∣ter, of which decoction of broath being strained, you shall need to take three pintes or a quart at the least. And then into that you may put such drugges as shall bee needefull to the weight of three or foure ounces, according as the simples shall bee more or lesse vio∣lent. Of Oyle at the least halfe a pinte, and of Salt two or three drammes, and then to bee ministred Luke-warme with a horne or pipe made of purpose, when the horse is not alto∣gether full panched, but rather empty, be it either in forenoone or after-noone. And as touching the time of keeping glisters in the body, you shal vnderstand, that to glisters ab¦stersiue halfe an houre or lesse may suffice: to glisters Lenitiue a longer time if it may be and to glisters Glutinatiue, the longest time of all is most needfull. Of Purgations. PVrgations for men may be made in diuers sorts and formes, but horses are wont to be purged onely with pilles, or els with purging powders put into Ale, Blundevile wine or some other liquor. But the simples whereof such pils or powders be made, would be chosen with iudgement and aptly applyed, so as you may purge away the hurtfull humours, and not the good. Learne first therefore to know with what humour or humours the horse is greeued, be it Choler, Flegme, or Melancholy, and in what part of the body such humors do abound: then what simples are best to purge such humors, & with what property, quali¦ty, and temperament they be indued. For some be violent and next cousins to poison, as Scamony, or Coloquintida. Some againe are gentle, and rather meat than medicines, as Manna, Cassia, Whay, Prunes, and such like. And some againe be neither too violent, nor too gentle, but in a meane, as Rhewbarbe, Agaricke, Sene, Aloes. The olde men did vse much to purge horses with the pulpe of Coloquintida, and sometime with the rootes of wilde Cowcumber, and sometime with the broathe of a sodden Whelpe mingled with Nitrum, and diuers other thinges whereof I am sure I haue made mention before in the curing of horses diseases. Notwithstanding I would not wish you to be rash in purging a horse after the old mens example. For as their simples many times bee very violent, so the quantities thereof by them prescribed are verie much, and dangerous for any horse to take in these daies, in the which neither man nor beast, as it seemeth, is of such force or strength as they were in times past. And therefore whensoeuer you would purge him with such like kindes of Pur∣gations as Martin vseth, wherof you haue example before in diuers places, and whensoe∣uer you list for knowledge sake to deale with other simples, to proue them first vpon such Iades as may well be spared. For whosoeuer mindeth to purge a horse well, that is, to do him good and no hurt, had neede to consider manie things: as the nature of the horses di∣sease, and the horses strength: also the nature, strength and quantity of the medicine that he ministreth: the Region, or Countrey the time of the disease, the time of the yeere and daie. For as the diseases and euill humors causing such diseases are diuers, so doe they re∣quire to be purged with diuers medicines, diuerslie compounded, wherein consisteth a point of Art to be learned at the Physitians hands, and not at mine. Againe, weake, delicate, and tender Horses, may not be purged in such sorte, as those that be of a strong sturdie nature. And therefore in such cases the qualitie and quantity of the simples is not a little to be considered, neither is the hotnesse or coldnesse of the Regi∣on to be neglected, nor the time of the disease. For some require to be purged in the verie beginning some, not vntill the matter be throughlie digested: and though the disease pro∣ceed perhaps of colde and cold humors, yet a man may not Minister such hot thinges in Summer, as he would do in Winter, nor in the contrarie ease, such cold thinges in Win∣ter as he would in Summer. And therefore the time and season of the yeare is also to bee obserued: yea the day and time of the day. For the more temperate the day is the better, not in an extreame hot day, for making the horse to faint, nor yet when the winde blow∣eth in the cold North, for that wil stop and hinder the working of the medicine, but rather in a temperate moist day, when the wind is in the South, if it may bee, for that will further and helpe the working of the medicine, and make the body loose and soluble. Againe for a horse, whether you purge him with pils or drinke, it is best for him (as Mar∣tin saith) to take them in the morning, after that he hath fasted from meat and drinke al the night before. And hauing receiued his medicine, let him be walked vppe and downe, one houre at the least, and then set him vp, and suffered to stand on the bit two or three houres without any meat, but in the meane time see that he be well littered, and warme couered: and at three houres end, offer him a little of a warme mash made with Wheate meale, or with bran, or else with ground mault. Giue him little meat or none vntill he be purged: all which thinges haue bin shewed you before in diuers places, and therefore I thinke it not good to be tedious vnto you with often recitall thereof. Of Cauterization, or giuing the fire, aswell actuall as potentiall. FOrasmuch as the fire is iudged of all the olde writers to be the chiefest remedy, and as it were the last refuge in all diseases almost whereunto a horse is subiecte, I thought good therefore to talke of it in this place, and the rather, for that fewe or none of our Ferrers vnlesse it be Martin, or such as haue beene taught, do know howe to giue the fire, or to what end it serueth. But first you shall vnderstand, that according to the learned Chi∣rurgians, yea, also according to my old Authors, there be two kinds of Cauterie, the one actuall, and the other potential. The Cauterie actual is that which is done onely by fiering of the greeued place with a hot yron. The potentiall Cauterie is done by applying vnto the greeued place, some medicine corosiue, putrifactiue, or causticke. But we will speake first of the actuall cautery, shewing you wherefore it is good, then of what mettell and fa∣shion your instrument should be made, and finally how and when to vse them. Auicen saith, that an actuall cauterie moderately vsed, is a noble remedy to stoppe co∣ruption of members, to rectifie the complexion of the same, and also to staunch bloode. How be it you must beware (saith he) that you touch not the sinnewes, chordes, or liga∣ments, least the member be weakened, or that the crampe insueth. Vegetius also writing of horse-leach-craft, praiseth the actuall cavterie very much, speaking in this sort. The actuall cautery saith he, bindeth together parts losened, it doth attinuate parts blowne and puffed vp, it drieth vp superfluous moisture, it looseneth, and diuideth euill matter gathered to∣gether into knots, it asswageth old griefes, it rectifieth those parts of the body that are co∣rupted by any manner of way, reducing them to their pristine estate, and suffereth no su∣perfluity to grow or increase, for the skinne being opened with a hot yron, all kind of cor∣ruption by vertue of the fire is first digested and ripened, and then dissolued, so as the mat∣ter doth yssue out at the holes, whereby the member or part before offended is nowe hea∣led, and eased of all paine and greefe: yea the holes being once closed and cleane shut vp, that place is stronger and better knit, and couered with a tougher skin that euer it was be∣fore. Now as touching the instruments whereof, and of what fashion they should be made you shall vnderstand, that Vegetius and the other old writers would haue them to be made of copper, praising that mettell to be far better to burne with, that yron. The chirurgians for mans body do praise gold and siluer, but as for the fashion of the yrons, it is to bee re∣ferred to the kinde of sore place and grieued, wherewith you haue to deale, according to the diuersity whereof, the instruments are to be made of diuers fashions, as some with sea∣ring yrons with sharpe edges, and some with blunt and broade edges, some like right, and some like crooked Bodkins, and some like hookes and sickles, and some with a great but∣ton, and some with a smal Button at the one ende, in making whereof, the Ferrers iudge∣ment is most needfull, who ought to be so skilfull as he may be able to make al maner of y∣rons that he should occupy, and to alter them according as need shall require. And there∣fore I thought good onely heere to speake of the common drawing yron, and of the button yron, like in forme to those that Martin vseth, referring all the rest to your owne iudgement, and specially sith you haue bin fully instructed before of what sort they shold be made meet to serue your turne in any disease: Nowe, as touching the vse of the instru∣ments, two things are specially to be considered, that is the heating of the yron, and the bearing of the hand. For the backe of the yron may not be red hot, but onely the edge, for feare of yeelding too much heat. And therefore though it be made red hot at the first, yet it shall be good before you occupy it, to cool the backe of the instrument in water, and as touching the bearing of the hand more euenly and lightly it is donne the better, and that according as the finenesse and thinnesse of the skin shall require, which is to be iudged by the haire. For if the haire be short and fine, then it is a signe of a fine skinne, if longe and rough, then it betokeneth a thicke skinne. The fine skinne requireth the lighter hand, and not to be burned so deepe as the thicke skinne, yet both must be burned vntill they looke yellow. But the fine skinne will looke yellow with lesser burning, then the thicke skinne. For the thicke skinne with his long haire doth choke the fire, and therefore requireth a more heauy hand: yea, and more often heating of the instrument than the thinne skinne doeth, and be sure to draw alwaies with the haire, and not against the haire, in what forme and in what manner of lines hath beene taught you before: for those must be made either long, short, deepe, shallow, right-crooked, or ouer-thwart, according as the disease doeth re∣quire: you haue learned also how to alay the heat of the fire, after such drawing. And ther∣fore I haue no more to say heere, but onely to admonish you acccording to Vegetius pre∣cepts, not to fire anie sinnewie place, nor bone that is broken or out of iointe, for feare of weakening the whole member, nor to bear so heauy or vneuen hand, as you should there∣by deforme or misfashion any part of the horse, nor be too hasty in giuing the fire, but to attempt first all other conuenient remedies, and when nothing else will helpe to make the fire your last refuge, and yet not so much to neglect it and abhorre it, like the ignoraunt sort, as you will not vse it when need requireth, for lack whereof many horses go lame, and vncured of diuers diseases. P ctise your selus therefore in giuing the fire at needful times with iudgement and discretion, so shall you do it to the horses benefit, and to your owne great praise and profit. Of Cauteries potentiall. C Auteries potentiall, as Iohannes Vigo saith, are medicines Corosiue, Putrifactiue and Causticke. This word Corosiue, is deriued of the Latine word Corrodo, which is as much to saie, as to gnaw and frette, and of such Corosiues, some be simple and some compounde. The simple as Vigo saith, be such as these be, Roche Alum, as well burnte as not burnt, spunge of the Sea somewhat burnt, Lime, redde corall powder of Mercury. Compound corosiues be these, Vnguentum A∣postolorum, Vnguentum aegyptiacum, Vnguentum Ceraceum. Medicines putrifactiue, called of the learned sort, Septica according to Auicen, be those that haue strength to corrupte the complexion of the member, and to induce any scarre like dead flesh, causing great pain: yea and Feuers, & therefore ought not to be ministred, but to strong bodies and in strong diseases, as in Carbuncles, Cankers, Vlcers, and such like, and they bee these, Arsenicke sublimat resalgar, and other medicines compound therwith. Siluius also addeth thereunto Sandaraca, Chrysocolla, and Aconitum, but he doth not agree with Auicen in the description of the putrifactiue medicines: For he saith, that they haue little paine or none, neither bee they so hot and drie as those that are called Escharotica : that is to say crustiue: which be hot in the forth degree and do breed a crust and scarre, and cause great paine, as vnslect lime, and the burned dregges of wine: wherefore it seemeth that Auicens description belongeth rather to the crustiue than to the putrifactiue medicines. Notwithstanding, I must needs say that our Chirurgions and also Ferrers, do find both Arsenicke and Resalgar, to be so sharpe, hotte, and burning things, as when they minister the same to any part of the body, they are forced to alay the sharpenesse thereof: the chi∣rurgians with the iuyce of Plantaine or Daffadill, or else of House-leeke, the Ferrers with Hogges-greace. Medicines causticke: that is to say burning, are those whose operation are most strong and inclineth to the natute of the fire, and yet more easily alayed as Vigo wri∣teth, than the medicines putrifactiue, and therefore may be more safely vsed. They bee made as he saith of strong lie, called Capitellum, or Magistra, of Vitriolae Romanae, Sal Nitri, Aqua fortis, of this sort be al those which Vigo calleth the blistering medicines, as Apium, Cantharides, Ciclamine, Onions, strong Garlicke, Melanacardinum, the stones or graines of Vitis alba, otherwise called Brione. Moreouer, Vigo maketh euery one of these cauteries potentiall to excel one another, as it were by certaine degrees, saying, that corosiues bee weaker then putrifactiues, and putrifactiues be weaker then causticke, and therefore coro∣siues worke in the vpper part and in soft flesh, Putrifactiues in hard flesh and deepe. But caustickes haue power to breake the skin in hard flesh and do enter most deepely. The vse of the moste part of which thinges haue beene taught you before in sundry places, accor∣ding to Martins experience. And therefore I leaue to trouble you any further, wishing you that are desirous to know any more of those matters, to read Taugantius writing De piroticis. And Siluius de medica∣mentorum compositione. And Iohn Vigo writing of surgerie, Englished but few yeares since. But the old writers so farre as I can iudge by the wordes of Absirtus, and others, that write or horseleachcraft, do applie this worde causticke, to such medicines as are astrictiue and binding, called of Martin and other Ferrers in these daies, binding charges, as may well appeare by the composition and vse heere following, recited by Vegetius in this sort. The receipt of a Causticke vsed by Chiron, to dry vp the superfluous moisture and to bind parts loosened, and to strengthen parts weakened. TAke of Bitumen Iudaicum two pounde, of Bitumen Apolonij two pounde, of the purest part of Frankencense six ounce, of Bdellium Arabicum two ounces, of Deares sewet 2. pound, of Populeum two ounces, of Galbanum two ounces, of the drops of Storax two oun∣ces, of common wax two pound, of Resin Gabial one pounde, of Viscus Italicus three oun∣ces, of Apoxima two ounces, of the iuice of hipsop two ounces, of the drops of Armoniake two ounces, of pitch one pound. Another Causticke vsed by Pelagonius, to dry vp swellings, Bladders, Windgals, and splents in the Legges and ioynts. TAke virgin wax one pound, of Rozen two pound and a halfe, of Galbanum three oun∣ces, of Asphaltum Iudaicum two pound, of Mirrhe secondary two pounde, of Bitumen one pound, of Armoniacke six ounces, of Costus six ounces. Boile all these things together in an earthen pot, sauing the Asphaltum, Armoninack & Costum: which being first ground like fine flower, must be added vnto the other thinges, and after that they haue been boiled and cooled, and then boiled al together againe, and well stirred, so as they may bee incor∣porated together, and made all one substance. These kindes of emplaisters or ointmentes ought in my iudgement to be so called, as I said before, rather binding charges, than cau∣slike medicines, because there be no such extreame corosiue or burning simples in these, as are before recited. Notwithstanding I refer my iudgment to those that be better lerned, and so end for being ouer tedious. For if I would, I could take very good occasion heere to speake of diuers others other medicines, whereof some are called Anodina, easing paine and griefe. Martin calleth them Linoges, which are made of Lineseede, Cammomile, soft greace and such like things, as are hot in the first degree, some againe are called Narcotica, that is to say, astonying or bringing to sleepe, as those that are made of Opium, Mandrago∣ a, Popie, and such like cold and grosse things. And some are called Sarcotica, that is, bree∣ding flesh, as Barly flower and Frankencense. And many other kinds of emplaisters, oint∣ments, waters and salues, which would occupy a booke of no smal volume, to bee written hereafter by some other perhaps, if not by my selfe. And in the meane time, let this that I haue already written suffice. Of the Anticor. AN Anticor, commeth of superfluity, of euill blood or spirit in the artires, and also of inflammation in the liuer, which is ingendered by meanes of too choise keeping, Markham. and ouermuch rest, which choaketh the vital power, and occasion vnnaturall swel∣lings in the brest, which if they ascend vpward and come into the necke, they are instantly death: the cure thereof is in this sort. Let him bleed so as he may bleed abundantly, then with a sharp knife in diuers places cut the swelling: which done, set a cupping-glasse ther∣on, and cup it till the glasse filled with foule water fall away it selfe: then giue the Horse to drinke three mornings together a pinte of Malmesie well stirred with Sinamon, Lycoras, and a little Bezar stone, and during his sicknes, let his drinke bee warmed, and mingled with either Bran or Malt. Of the Cords. THe Cords is a disease that maketh a horse stumble, and many times fall, and they a∣peare in a horses forelegs, this is the cure thereof. Take a sharpe knife, and cut a slitte euen at the tip of his nose, iust with the point of the grisle, open the slit being made, and you shall perceiue a white string, take it vp with a Bores tooth, or some crooked bod∣kin, and cut it insunder, then stitch vppe the slit and annoint it with Butter, and the horse doubtlesse shall be recouered. Of the Millets. THe Millets is a griefe that appeareth in the Fetlockes behinde, and causeth the haire to shed three or foure inches long, and a quarter of an inch in bredth, like as it were bare and ill to cure, but thus is the cure: First wash it well with strong lye, and rub it till it bleede, then binde vnto it Hony, vnslect lime, and Deares sewet, boiled and mingled together, this do for the space of a weeke, and it shall be whole. Of the Serew. A Serew is a foule soraunce, it is like a Splent, but it is a little longer, and is most com∣monly on the outside of the fore legge, as the splint is on the inside, the cure is thus. Take two spoonefuls of strong Wine-Vinegar, and one spoonefull of good Sallet-oyle, mingle them together, and euery morning bestow one houre in rubbing the sorance with it altogether downeward til it be gone, which will not be long in going. The medicines arising out of Horses. T He Graecians haue written nothing at all concerning wilde horses, Pliny. because in their country there was none of them v∣sually bredde or gotten: yet notwithstanding the same wee ought to thinke that all medicines or anye other thinges, which do proceed from them, are more strong in operati∣on, and haue in them greater force and power then anye common horses haue, as it falleth out in all sortes of other beasts. The blood of a horse (as Pliny affirmeth) doth gnaw into deade flesh with a putrifactiue force, the same vertue hath the blood of Mares, which haue bin couered by horses: Also the bloode of a horse (but e∣specially of one which is a breeder) doeth verye much make and helpe againste im∣postumes, and small bunches which do arise in the flesh. Moreouer it is said that the bloud of a young Asse is very good against the Iaundice, and the ouer-flowing of the gall, as al∣so the same force and effect is in the blood of a young horse. The horse-leaches do vse the blood of horses for diuers diseases which are incident vnto them, both by annointing or rubbing the outward parts, as also within their bodies. Furthermore if one do cut the vaines of the pallet of a horses mouth, and let it runne downe into his belly, Theomnestus it will presently destroy and consume the maw or belly-worms, which are within him. When a horse is sicke of the pestilence, they draw blood out of the veines in his spurring place, and mingling the same vpon a stone with salt, make him to licke it vp. The blood of a horse is also mingled with other medicines, and being annointed vpon the armes and shoulders of men or beasts, Ʋeg tius which are broken or out of ioynt, doth very much helpe them. But a horse which is weary or tyred, you must cure after this manner. Firste, draw some bloude out of his matrixe or wombe, and mingle it with Oyle and Wine, and then put it on the fire till it bee luke-warme, and then rubbe the horse all ouer againste the haires. If the sinnewes of horses do wax stiffe or shrink in together, it is very necessary that the sicke parts should be annointed with the hot bloode which doeth proceede from him, Pliny. for horses also which are fed in the field vse their flesh and dung, against the biting and stinging of Serpents. We do also find that the flesh of horses being well boiled is very medicinable for di∣uers diseases. Furnerius. Moreouer it is very vsuall and common with the women of Occitania to take the fat or greace of horses to annoint their heades to make the haire of their heads multi∣ply and increase, and certaine later Phisitians do mingle the marrow of a horse with other ointments for a remedy against the crampe. The marrow of a horse is also very good to loosen the sinnewes which are knit and fast∣ned together, but first let it be boiled in wine, and afterwards made cold, and then anoin∣ted warmly either by the fire or Sun. If a horse do labor in what kind of impostume which they vulgarly call the worme, either any where as well as in the nose, they do open the skin with a searirg yron, and doe sprinkle Verdigreace within the horses mouth being brent, there being added thereunto sometimes the seed of Hen-bane. The teeth of a male horse not gelded or by any labor made feeble, being put vnder the head or ouer the head of him that is troubled or starteth in his dreame, doth withstand and resist all vnquietnes which in the time of his rest might happen vnto him. Albertus Pliny also doeth assent that flower dooeth heale the sorenes of a horses teeth and gums, and the clefts and chinkes of a horses feet. The teeth also of a horse is verye profitable for the curing of the Chilblanes which are rotten and full of corruption when they are swollen full ripe. Marcellus. Marcellus saith that the toothe of a horse being beaten and crushed into very small powder, and being sprinkled vppon a mans genitall doth much profit, and very effectually helpe him: but the teeth which were first ingendered in a horse haue this vertue in them, that if they should touch the teethe of man or woman who are molested and grieued with the tooth-ache, they shal presently find a finall ende of their paine: if in the like manner a childe doe kisse the nose or snowt of a horse he shal neuer feele paine in his teeth, neither at any time shall the childe be bitten by the horse. Sextus. The teeth which do first of all fall from horses, being bound or fastned vpon children in their infancie, do very easily procure the breeding of the teeth, but with more speed and more effectually if they haue neuer touched the grovnd, wherefore the poet doth very wel apply these verses, saying; Collo igitur molli dentes nectentur equini Qui prima fuerint pullo crescente caduci. It is also said that if the haire of a horse be fastned vnto the house of a mans enemy, it wil be a meanes that neither little flies or small gnats shall flie by his dwelling place or aboad. The tongue of a horse being neuer accustomed vnto wine, Pliny is a most present and expedient me∣dicide to alay or cure the milt of a man or Woman (as Caecilius Bion reporteth vnto vs, that he learned it of the Barbarians.) But Marcellus saith, that the horse tongue ought to be dried and beaten into small pouder, and put into any drinke except Wine onely, and foorthwith it will shew the commodity which riseth thereuppon, by easing either man or Woman, of the paine of the spleene or milt: diuers also do thinke that a horses tongue vsed after this manner, is a good meanes or preseruatiue against the biting of Serpentes or any other ve∣nemous creatures. But for the curing of any sores or griefes in the inward partes, the genitall of a horsse is most of all commended: for as Pliny supposeth, this genitall of a horse is very medicina∣ble for the loosing of the belly, as also the bloud, marrow, or liuer of a Goate, but these thinges doe rather dry vp and close the belly (as before we haue taught) concerning the Goat. Plinius In the heart of Horsses there is found a bone, most like vnto a dogs tooth, it is saide that this doth driue away all griefe or sorrow from a mans heart, and that a tooth being pulled from the cheekes or iaw bones of a dead horse doth shew the full and right number of the sorrowes of the party so grieued. The dust of a horse hoofe annointed with oile and water, Plinius doth driue away impostumes and little bunches which rise in the flesh in what part of the body soeuer they be; and the dust of the hoofe of an asse annointed with oile, water, and whot vrine, doth vtterly expell all wens and kernels which do rise in the neck, arme-holes, or any other part of the body, of either man or woman. The genitall of a gelded horse dryed in an ouen, beaten to powder, and giuen twice or thrice in a little whot broath to drinke vnto the party grieued, is by Pliny accounted an excellent and approued remedy for the secunds of a woman. The foame of a horse, or the dust of a horse hoofe dried, is very good to driue away shamefastnes, being annointed with a certaine titulation. Marcellus. The scrapings of the horses hoofes being put in wine and poured in∣to the horsses nostrils, do greatly prouoke his vrin. The ashes also of a horsses hoofe, being mingled with wine and water doth greatly ease and helpe the disease called the collicke or stone: as also by a perfume which may be made by the hoofes of Horses being dryed, a child which is still borne is cast out. The milke of Mares is of such an excellent vertue, that it doth quite expell the poyson of the Sea-hare, & all other poison whatsoeuer, drink also mingled with Mares milk, doth make the body loose and laxatiue. It is also counted an excellent remedy against the falling sicknesse, to drinke the stones of a Boare out of Mares milke or water. Hippocrates If there be any filth or matter lying in the matrice of a woman, lether take Mares milke boiled and througly strained, and presently the filth and excrements will void cleane away. If so be that a Wo∣man be barren and cannot conceiue, let her then take Mares milke (not knowing what it is) and let her presently accompany with a man and she wil conceiue. The milk of a Mare being drunk doth asswage the labor of the matrice, and doth cause a still child to bee cast forth. If the seede of hen-bane be beaten small and mingled with Mares milke, and bound with a Harts skin, so that it may not touch the ground, and fastened or bound to a woman they will hinder her conception. The thinnest or latest part of the milke of a Mare doth very easily, gently, and with∣out any danger purge the belly. Mares milke being daily annointed with a little hony doth without any paine or punishēnt take away the wounds of the eies being new made. Cheese made of Mares milke doth represse and take away all wringings or aches in the belly what∣soeuer. If you anoint a combe with the foame of a horse wherwith a young man or youth doth vse to comb his head it is of such force as it will cause the haire of his head neither to encrease or any whit to appeare. The foame of a horse is also very much commended for them which haue either pain or difficulty of hearing in their ears, or else the dust of horse-dung being new made and dryed, and mingled with oyle of Roses. The griefe or sorenes of a mans mouth or throat, being washed or annointed with the foame of a Horse which hath bin fed with Oates or barly, doth presently expell the paine of the sorenesse, if so be that it be 2. or 3. times washed ouer with the iuyce of young or greene Sea-crabs beaten small together: but if you cannot get the Sea-crabs which are greene, sprinkle vpon the griefe the smal powder which doth come from dried Crabs which are baked in an Ouen made of brasse, and afterward wash the mouth where the paine is and you shall finde pre∣sent remedy. The fome of a horse, Rasis being 3. or 4. times taken in drinke doth quiet expell and driue away the cough. But Marcellus doth affirme that whosoeuer is troubled with the cough, or consumption of the lunges, and doth drinke the foame of a Horse by it selfe a∣lone without any drinke shall finde present help and remedy: but as Sextus saith the horse will presently die after it. The same also being mingled with hot water and giuen to one who is troubled with the same diseases, Marcellus being in manner past al cure, doeth presently procure health, Rasis but the death of the horse doth instantly ensue. The sweat of a horse being mingled with wine and so drunke, doth cause a woman which is very big and in great labor, to cast a still childe. Albertus. The sweat of any beast, (but as Albertus saith) onely of a horse, doth breed wind in a man or womans face being put thereupon, Rasis and besides that, doth bring the squince or squincy, as also a filthy stinking sweat. If swords, kniues, or the points of speares when they are red fire hot, be annointed with the sweat of a horse, they will be so venemous and full of poison, that if a man or woman be smitten or pricked therewith, Rasius they wil neuer cease from bleeding as long as life doth last If a horse be wounded with an arrow, and haue the sweat of another horse, and bread which hath bene brent, being mingled in mans Vrine, giuen him to drink, and afterwards some of the same, being mingled with horse-grease put into the wounde, it will in short time procure him ease and helpe. There are some which wil assure vs, that if a man be troubled with the belly wormes, or haue a Serpent crept into his belly, if hee take but the sweate of a horse being mingled with his vrine and drinke it, it will presently cause the wormes or the Serpent to yssue forth. Dioscorides. Pliny The dung of a horse or Asse which is fedde with grasse, being dried and afterward dip∣ped in wine, and so drunke, is a very good remedy against the bitings and blowes of Scor∣pions. The same medicines they doe also vse, being mingled with the genital of a Hare in Vineger, both against the Scorpion, and against the shrew-mouse. The force is so great in the poyson of a madde Dogge or Bitch that his pargeted Vrine doth much hurt, especially vnto them that haue a sore bile vpon them, the chiefest remedy▪ therefore against the same is the dung of a horse mingled with Vineger, and being warmed put into the scab or sore. The dung aswel of Asses as of horses either raw, colde, or burned, is excellent good against the breaking forth or yssues of the blood. Marcellus The dung of Horses or Asses being newe made or warme, and so clapped and put to a green wound doth very easily and speedily stanche the bleeding. If the vaine of a horse bee cut and the blood doe yssue out in too great aboundance, apply the dung of the same horse vnto the place where the veine is cut, Russius. and the bleeding wil presently cease, wherefore the poet doth very wel expresse it in these verses following; Pell ganius. Sine fimus manni cum testis vritur oui Et reprimit fluidos miro medicamine cursus. Albertus. The same doth also very wel driue away the corruption in mens body which doth cause the blood to stinke if it be well and iustly applyed vnto the corrupt place: The same also beeing mingled with oyle of Roses, Aes ulapius. and new made, and so applied vnto the eares, doeth not onely driue away the paine, but also doth very much helpe for hearing; There is another remedy also for the hearing, which is this, to take the dunge of a horse which is new made, and to make it hot in a furnace, Marcellus. and then to poure it on the middle of the heade against the V la, and afterward to tie the aforesaid dunge, in a linnen or wollen cloath vnto the toppe of the head in the night time. Pliny The dung of a young Asse when he is first foaled, giuen in Wine to the quantity or mag∣nitude of a Beane, is a present remedy for eyther man or Woman who is troubled with the Iaundice or the ouer-flowing of the gall: and the same property hath the dung of a younge horse or Colte when hee is new foaled. But the dunge of an olde horse, being boiled in faire water, Sextus and afterward strained and so giuen to the party to drinke, who is troubled with Water in his belly or stomacke, doth presently make vent for the same. There is also an excellent remedy against the Collicke and stone, which is this, to take a handfull of the dung of a horse which hath bene fedde with Oates and Barley, and not with grasse, Empiric s. and mingle verye vvell it with halfe a pinte of Wine, all which I do gesse will amount vnto the waight of eighteene ounces, and then boyle them altogether vntil halfe of them bee boyled or consumed away, and then drinke the same by little and little vntil it bee all drunke vp, but it will be much better for the party that is troubled to drinke it vp altogether if he be able. There is moreouer a very good and easie way by horse-dung to cure the Ague or quar∣terne feauer, which is thus, to burne the aforesaid dung, Marcellus and to mingle the very dust it selfe thereof in old wine, and then beat it vnto small powder, and so giue it vnto the party who is troubled therewith, to drinke or suck without any water in it, and this wil very speedily pro∣cure ease and helpe. If that a woman supposeth her childe which is in hir wombe to be dead, Pliny let her drinke the milt or spleene of a horse in some sweet water, not to the smel, but to the tast, and she wil presently cast the childe. The same vertue is in the perfume which is made of a horses hoof, as also in the dry dung of a horse: There are some which do vse this means against the falling sicknes, or the sicknes called Saint Iohns euil, Plinyus that is to mingle the water or vrine which a horse doth make with the water which commeth from the Smiths trough, and so to giue it the party in a potion: There is a very good helpe for cattell which do void blood through their Nostrils or secret parts which is this, Empiricus. to make a paast of Wheat-flower and beat it and mingle it togither with Butter and Egges in the vrine of a horse which hath lately drunke, and afterward to giue that paast or poultes baked euen into ashes to the beast so grieued. To prouoke vrine when a mans yard is stopt, there is nothing so excellent as the dung or filthe which proceedeth from the vrine which a horse hath made, being mingled with wine, and then strained, and afterwards poured into the nostrils of the party so vexed. There are certaine Tetters or Ring-wormes in the knees of horses, and a little aboue the hooues in the bending of these parts, there are indurate and hardned thicke skins, Dioscorides which be∣ing beaten into small powder and mingled with Vineger, and so drunke, are an exceeding good preseruatiue against the falling sicknes: Galen. the same is also a very good remedy for them which are bitten with any wilde Beast whatsoeuer. By the Tetter or Ring-worme which gro∣weth in a horses knees or aboue the hoofes beaten and mingled with oyle, and so poured in the eares, the teeth of either man or woman which were weake and loose, will be made ve∣ry strong and fast. The aforesaid Tetter without any mingling with oyle, pliny. doth also heal and cure the head-ache and falling sicknes, in either man or woman. The same also being drunk out of Clarret Wine or Muscadel for forty daies togither, doeth quite expel and driue a∣way the collicke and stone. If that any man do get and putte vp the shooe of a horse beeing stroake from his hoofe as he trauaileth in his pace which doeth many times happen, Magi, it wil be an excellent remedy for him against the sobbing in the stomacke called the hicket. OF THE HYAENA, AND THE diuers kinds thereof. W E are nowe to discourse of a Beast whereof it is doubtful whether the names or the kindes thereof bee more in number, and therefore to begin with the names, it seemeth to me in general, that it is, The names and other general acci∣dents. the same Beast which is spoken of in holy scripture, and called Zeeb-ereb, and Araboth. Zepham. 3. Principes vrbis Hierosolymae velut Leones rugientes, iudices eius similes sunt lupis Vespertinis qui ossa non relinqunt ad dilu∣culum : Their Princes are roaring Lyons, and their iudges are like to night-wolues which leaue not the bones til the morning, as it is vul∣garly translated. In like sort Ier. Cap, 5, calleth them Zeeb-Araboath, Wolues of the wilder∣nes, and the Prophet Habbakuk. Cap. 1. vseth the word Zeeb-ereb, Wolues of the euening. By which it is made easie to consider and discusse what kinde of Beast this Hyaena may be deemed: for the Hyaena as I shal shew you afterward, is a Greek word. And first of al I vt¦terly seclude al their opinions, which translate this word Arabian wolues, for the Haebrew notes cannot admit such a version or exposition: But seeing we read in Oppianus and Tzet∣zes, that there are kinds of Wolues which are called Harpages, more hungry then the resi∣due, liuing in Mountains, very swift of foot & in the Winter time, comming to the gates of Citties, and deuouring both flesh and bones of euery liuing creature they can lay hold on, especially Dogs and men, and in the morning go away againe from their prey, I take them to be the same beasts which the Graecians cal Hyaenae, which is also the name of a fishe much like in nature hereunto. It is also called Glanos, and the Phrygians, and Bythinians Ganos, & from one of these came the Illirian or Sclauonian word San, and it seemeth that the Graeci∣ans haue giuen it a name from Swine, because of the gristles growing on the back, for an Hyaena can haue no better deriuation then from Hus or Hyn. Iulius Capitolinus calleth it Belbus in Latine, in the same place where he recordeth that there were decem Belbi sub Gor∣diano ten Hyaenaes in the daies of Gordianus : And the reason of this name is not improbably deriued from Belba a cittie of Egypt. Pincianus a learned man calleth it Grabthier, because it hunteth the sepulchers of the dead. Albertus in stead of Hyaena, calleth it Iona. The Ara∣bians cal it Kabo, & Zabo, or Ziba, and Azaro. I take it also to be the same beast which is cal∣led Lacta, and Ana, and Zilio, because that which is reported of these is true in the Hyae∣na, Albertus. they frequent graues, hauing sharp teeth, & long nailes, being very fierce, liuing toge∣ther in heards and flocks, and louing their own kind most tenderly, but most pernicious and hatefull to all other, being very crafty to set vpon a fit prey defending it selfe from the rage of stronger beasts by their teeth & nailes, or else by flight or running away. Wherfore we hauing thus expressed the name we will handle the kinds which I finde to be three, the first Hyaena, the second Papio or Dabuh, the third Crocuta and Leucrocuta, whereunto by coniecture we may adde a forth, called Mantychora. THE FIGVRE OF THE FIRST HYAENA. T His first and vulgar kind of Hyaena is bred in Affricke and Arabia, being in quantity of body like a wolfe, Hieronimus Aristotle. but much rougher haird, for it hath bristles like a horsses mane all along his back, & in the middle of his back it is a litle crooked or dented, the colour yellowish, but bespeckled on the sides with blew spots, which make him looke more terrible▪ as if it had so many eies. The eies change their colour at the pleasure of the beast, Oppianus The several parts. a thousand times a day, for which cause many ignorant writers haue affirmed the same of the whole body, yet can he not see one quarter so perfectly in the day as in the night; & therfore he is called Lupus vespertinus a wolfe of the night. The skilful Lapidarists of Germany affirme that this beast hath a stone in his eies (or rather in his head) called Hyaena or Hyaenius ; but the ancients say that the ap∣ple or puple of the eie is turnd into such a stone, & that it is indued with this admirable qua¦lity, Pliny that if a man lay it vnder his tong, he shal be able to foretell and prophesie of things to come, the truth hereof I leaue to the reporters. Their back-bone stretcheth it selfe out to the head, so as the necke cannot bend except the whole body be turned about, and ther∣fore whensoeuer he hath occasion to wry his necke, S lmus Albertus. he must supply that quality by remo∣uing of his whole bodie. This Beast hath a very great hart as all other Beasts haue which are hurtful, by reason of their feare. The genital member is like a dogs or wolues; and I maruaile vpon what occa∣sion the writers haue beene so possessed with opinion that they change sexes, Aristotle Whether they change sexes yeerely and are somtime male and another female, that is to say male one yeare, and female another, according to these verses; Si tamen est aliquid mir ae nouitatis in istis Alternare vices & quae modo foemina tergo. Passa marem est nunc esse marem miremur Hyaenam. Ouid. Both kinds haue vnder their tailes a double note of passage, in the male there is a scissure like the secrets of a femal, & in the femal abunch like the stones of the male, but nether on nor other inward, but onely outward; and except this hath giuen cause of this opinion, I cannot learne the ground thereof: onely Orus writeth, that there is a fishe of this name which turneth sexe, and peraduentute some men hearing so much of the fish, Aelianus might mi∣stake it more easilye for the foure-footed-beast, and applye it thereunto. Their procre¦ation. These engen∣der not onely among themselues, but also with Dogs, Lyons, Tygers, and Wolues, for the Aetheopian Lyon being couered with an Hyaena beareth the Crocuta. The Thoes of whom we shall speake more afterward, are generated betwixt this beast and a Wolfe: and indeed it is not without reason that God himselfe in holy scripture calleth it by the name of a Vespertine Wolfe, seeing it resembleth a Wolfe in the quantity, colour, in voracity and gluttoning in of flesh, in subtilty to ouercome dogs and men, euen as a Wolfe doth silly sheepe. Their teeth are in both beasts like sawes, their genitals alike, The disposi∣tion and na∣tural proper∣ties of this beast. Pliny. Sol nus and both of them be∣ing hungry range & prey in the night season. This is accounted a most subtill and crafty beast according to the allusiue saying of Mantuan. Est in eis Pietas Crocodili astutia Hyaenae. And the female is far more subtill then the male, and therefore more seldome taken, for they are afraid of their own company. It was constantly affirmed that among eleuen Hy∣aenes, there was found but one female, it hath beene beleeued in ancient time that there is in this beast a magicall or enchanting power, for they write, that about what creature so∣euer he goeth round three times, it shall stand stone-still and not be able to mooue out of the place: and if Dogs do but come within the compasse of their shaddow and touch it, they presently loose their voice: and that this she dooth most naturally in the ful moone; Aelianus philes. for although the swiftnesse or other opportunity of the Dogges helpeth them to fly away from her, yet if she can but cast her shadow vpon them, she easily obtaineth her prey. She can also counterfeit a mans voice, vomit, cough, and whistle, by which meanes in the night time she commeth to houses or foldes where Dogs are lodged, and so making as though she vomited, or else whistling, draweth the Dogs out of doors to her and deuoureth them. Solinus. Aelianus. Likewise her nature is, if she find a man or a Dog on sleepe, she considereth whether shee or he haue the greater body, if she, then she falleth on him, and either with her weight, or some secret worke of nature by stretching her body vpon him killeth him, or maketh him sencelesse; whereby without resistance she eateth off his hands: but if she find her body to be shorter or lesser then his, then she taketh her heeles and flyeth away. If a man meet with this beast he must not set vpon it on the right hand, but on the lefte, for it hath bin often seene, that when in hast it did run by the Hunter on the right hand, he presently fel off from his horse sencelesse; and therefore they that secure themselues from this beast, must be carefull to receiue him on the left side, that so hee may with more fa∣cility be taken, especially (saith Pliny) if the cords wherein he is to be ensnared be fastned with seuen knots. Aelianus reporteth of them, that one of these comming to a man asleep in a sheep-coat, by laying her left hand or forefoote to his mouth made or cast him into a dead-sleep, and afterward digged about him such a hole like a graue, as shee couered all his body ouer with the earth, except his throat and head, whereupon she sat vntill she suf∣focated and stifled him: yet Philes attributeth this to her right foote. The like is attribu∣ted to a Sea-calfe, and the fish Hyaena, and therefore the old Magicians by reason of this exanimating property, did not a little glory in these beasts, as if they had beene taught by them to exercise diabolicall and praestigious incantations, wherby they depriued men of sence, motion, and reason. They are great enemies to men, and for this cause Solinus re∣porteth of them, that by secret accustoming themselues to houses or yardes, where Car∣penters or such mechanicks worke, they learne to call their names, and so will come be∣ing an hungred and call one of them with a distinct and articulate voyce, whereby he causeth the man many times to forsake his worke and goe to see the person calling him; but the subtill Hyaena goeth farther off, and so by calling allureth him from helpe of com∣pany, Textor. and afterward when she seeth time deuoureth him, and for this cause hir proper Epithite is Aemula vocis, Voyce counter-fayter. Aelinaus Their enmi∣tie with o∣ther beasts. Orus There is also great hatred betwixt a Pardall and this beast, for if after death their skins be mingled together the haire falleth off from the Pardals skinne, but not from the Hyae∣naes; and therfore when the Egyptians describe a superiour man ouercome by an infe∣riour, they picture these two skinnes, and so greatly are they afraide of Hyaenaes, that they runne from all beasts, creatures and places, whereon any part of their skinne is fa∣stened. And Aelianus saith, that the Ibis bird which liueth vpon serpents is killed by the gall of an Hyaena. He that will go safely through the mountaines or places of this beasts aboade, Rasis & Albertus say, The naturall vse of their skinnes. Palladius Rasis Plutarch that hee must carry in his hand a roote of Coloquintida. It is also beleeued that if a man compasse his ground about with the skinne of a Crocodile, an Hyaena, or a sea-Calfe, and hang it vp in the gates or gaps thereof, the fruites enclosed shall not be molested with haile or lightning. And for this cause Mariners were wont to couer the tops of their sailes with the skinnes of this beast or of the Sea-calfe; and Horus sayth, that a man clothed with this skinne may passe without feare or daunger through the mid∣dest of his enemies: for which occasion the Egyptians doe picture the skin of an Hyaena to signifie fearelesse audacitie. Neither haue the Magitians any reason to ascribe this to any praestigious enchauntment, seeing that a figge tree also is neuer oppressed with haile nor lightning. And the true cause thereof is assigned by the Philosophers to be the bitternesse of it, for the influence of the heauens hath no destructiue operation vppon bitter but vppon sweete things, Coelius and there is nothing sweete in a figge tree but onely the fruite. Also Collu∣mella writeth, that if a man put three bushels of seede graine into the skinne of this beast and afterward sowe the same, without all controuersie it will arise with much encrease. Gentian worne in an Hyaenaes skin seuen daies in steede of an amulet is very soueraigne against the biting of mad dogges. And likewise if a man hold the tongue of an Hyaena in his hand, there is no dogge that dareth to seize vpon him. The skinne of the forehead, or the bloud of this beast, resisteth all kind of witchcraft and incantation. Likewise Pliny writeth, that the haires layed to womens lips, maketh them amorous. And so great is the vanitie of the Magicians, that they are not ashamed to affirme that by the tooth of the vp∣per iaw of this beast on the right side bound vnto a mans arme or any part thereof, he shall neuer be molested with dart or arrow. Likewise they say, that by the genital of this beast, and the article of the backe-bone which is called Atlantios, with the skinne cleauing vnto it preserued in a house, keepeth the fa∣mily in continuall concord, and aboue al other, if a man carry about him the smallest and extreame gut of his intrailes, he shal not onely be deliuerd from the Tyrany of the higher powers, Actuarius Zoroastres but also foreknow the successe and euent of his petitions and sutes in Law. If his left foot and nailes be bound vp together in a Linnen bagge, and so fastned vnto the right arme of a man, he shal neuer forget whatsoeuer he hath heard or knoweth. And if he cut off the right foot with the left hand and weare the same, whosoeuer seeth him shal fal in loue with him, besides the Beast. Also the marow of the right foot is profitable for a Woman that loueth not her husband, if it be put into her nostrils; And with the powder of the left claw, they which are anointed therwith, it being first of al decocted in the blood of a weasil, do fal into the hatred of al men. And if the nailes of any beast bee found in his mawe after he is slain, it signifieth the death of some of his hunters: And to conclude, such is the folly of the Magitians, that they beleeue the transmigration of soules, not only out of one man into another, but also of man into Beasts. And therefore they affirm, that their men Symis and religious votaries departing life send their soules into Lyons, Pa phirius and their re∣ligious women into Hyaenaes. The excrements or bones comming out of the excrements when it is killed, are thought to haue vertue in them against magicall incantations. And Democritus writeth, that in Cappadocia and Mesia, by the eating of the hearbe Therionarcha, all wilde beastes fall into a deadly sleepe, and cannot be recouered but by the aspersion of the vrine of this beast. And thus much for the first kind, now followeth the second. THE SECOND KIND OF HYAENA called Papio or Dabuh. T His beast aboundeth neare Caesaria in quantity resembling a Foxe, but in wit and disposition a Wolfe; the fashion is, The region and quantity being gathered together, for one of them to go before the flocke singing or howling, and all the rest, answering him with correspondent tune; In haire it resembleth a Fox, & their voices are so shrill and sounding, that although they be very remote and farre off, yet do men heare them as if they were hard by: And when one of them is slaine, The lamen∣tation for the dead. Albertus. Bellunensis. The seuerall names. the re∣sidue flocke about his carcasse, howling like as they made funerall lamentation for the dead. When they growe to bee very hungry by the constraint of famine they enter into the Graues of men and eate their dead bodyes, yet is their fleshe in Syria, Damascus, and Berutus, eaten by men. It is called also Randelos, Abenaum, Aldabha, Dabha, Dahab, and Dhoboha, which are deriued from the Hebrew word Deeb or Deeba: Dabuh is the Arabian name, The parts & naturall dis∣position. and the Africans call him Leseph, his feete and legs are like to a mans, neither is it hurtfull to other beastes being a base and simple creature. The colour of it is like a Beare, and therefore I Iudge it to be Arctocyon which is ingendred of a beare and a dogge, and they barke onely in the night time. They are exceedingly delighted with Musicke, such as is vsed by pipes and tymbrels, The manner of their ta∣king. wherefore when the hunters haue found out their caues, they spred their nets and snares at the mouth thereof, and afterwards striking vp their in∣struments, the seely beast inconsiderat of all fraude commeth out and is taken, the pic∣ture hereof is formerly expressed. And there was one of these in Germanie in the yeere of our Lord 1551. at the Citty Auspurg to be seene publikely. It was brought out of the wildernesse of India, it did eate apples, peares, and other fruites of trees, and also bread, but especially it delighted in drinking of wine: when it was an hungry, it climed vp into trees, and did shake the boughes to make the fruite fall, and it is reported, that when it is in the tree, it feareth not an Elephant, but yet auoydeth all other beastes which it is not able to resist. It was of a chearefull nature, but then especially when it saw a woman, whereby it was gathered that it was a lustfull beast. His foure feete were deuided like a mans fingers, and the female euer bringeth foorth twins a male and a female together. It continually holdeth vp his tayle shewing the hole behind, for at euery motion it turneth that, as other beastes doe their head. It hath a short tayle, and but for that, I should iudge it to be a kind of Ape, I know not whether it be that kinde of little Wolfe which Bellonius saith aboundeth in Cilicia and Asia, which in the night time raueneth and commeth to the bodies of sleeping men, taking away from them their bootes, shooes, caps, or bridles: when they are shut vp in the night time they barke like dogges, but be∣ing at libertie they liue two hundred in a company, so that there is no beast so frequent as these in all Cilicia. As for the golden Woolfe spoken of by Oppianus I deferre the description of it to his due place, for they are not all of one colour, and thus much shall suffice for the se∣cond kinde of Hyaena. OF THE CROCVTA. The region proportion and other qualities. T He third kind of the Hyaena is called Crocuta not the Gulon aforesaid but another different from that, which is said to be an Aethiopian foure-footed beast, because it is ingen∣dred betwixt a lionesse and an Hyaena. His teeth are all of one bone, being very sharpe on both sides of his mouth, and included in fleshlike as in a case, that they may not be dulled: with their teeth they breake any thing. It is said also by Solinus that it neuer winketh, & that their nature seemeth to be tempered betwixt a dogge and a Woolfe, yet is it more fierce then either of both, more admirable in strength, and especially of the teeth and belly, hauing power to breake and digest any bone: it imita∣teth also the voice of a man to deuour them, as is said before in the Hyaena. In the Region Dachinabades, which is a mediterranean Country in the East, containing great and high mountaines. Amongst other wild Beasts, are abundance of these Crocut s, and at the marriage of Antonius the sonne of Seuerus the Emperour, to Plautilla the daugh∣ter of Plautianus, amongest the spectacles set foorth for the delight of the beholders, was a combat betwixt an Elephant and this beast, which before that time was neuer to be seene at Rome (as Dion reporteth) and thus much for the thirde kinde of Hyaena, except I may ad thereunto that Beast which the Italians call Loupchatt, that is Lupus Catus, a Wolfe-cat, re∣sembling in face a cat with sharpe and harmefull clawes, being betwixt a blacke and spotted colour, and was called an Indian wolfe, and this was to be publickely seene, in the Byshops castle at Trent. OF THE MANTICHORA. T His beast or rather Monster (as Ctesias writeth) is bred a∣mong the Indians, hauing a treble rowe of teeth beneath and aboue, whose greatnesse, roughnesse, and feete are like a Lyons, his face and eares like vnto a mans, his eies gray, and collour red, his taile like the taile of a Scorpion of the earth, armed with a sting, casting forth sharp pointed qui ls, his voice like the voice of a small trumpet or pipe, being in course as swift as a Hart; His wildnes such as can neuer be tamed, and his appetite is especially to the flesh of man. His body like the body of a Lyon, being very apt both to leape and to run, Philes so as no distance or space doth hinder him, and I take it to bee the same Beast which Auicen calleth Marion, and Maricomorion, with her taile she woundeth her Hunters whether they come before her or behind her, and presently when the quils are cast forth, new ones grow vp in their roome, wherewithal she ouercommeth all the hunters: and al∣though India be full of diuers rauening beastes, yet none of them are stiled with a title of Andropophagi, that is to say, Men-eaters; except onely this Mantichora. When the Indi∣ans take a Whelp of this beast, they all to bruise the buttockes and taile thereof, that so it may neuer be fit to bring sharp quils, afterwards it is tamed without peril. This also is the same beast which is called Leucrocuta about the bignesse of a wilde Asse, being in legs and hoofes like a Hart, hauing his mouth reaching on both sides to his eares, and the head & face of a female like vnto a Badgers. It is called also Martiora, which in the Persian tongue signifieth a deuourer of men, and thus we conclude the story of the Hyaena for her descrip∣tion, and her seuerall kindes now followeth the medicines arising out of her seuerall partes. The Medicines of the Hyaena. The Oyle in which a Fox is baked either aliue or dead, doth either altogether cure and make whole those which are troubled with the gout, The medici∣nal propertis if so be that the disease or sicknesse be greene or new, or at the least not of to longe continuance, it doeth so cure them, that al∣though it may happen to returne againe: yet it will be much more milde and gentle then before it had beene. But the oyle which proceedeth from Foxes doth nothing more driue away the forenamed disease, Galen then that which likewise is got or prepared out of the Hyae∣na; for that hath an excellent and eminent quallity of dissoluing & dispersing. The flesh of the Alzabo is both what and cold, Rasis and being baked with oile, doth very much help ey∣ther men or women which haue their feet gouty, or haue any paine in their ioynts, which may happen or come by the occasion of colde: for it is of a slender and dissolute sub∣stance. Pliny The vanity of the Magi or Wise-men which is witty in nothing but in circumstance of words, doth say that the best time to take Hyaenaes is when the Moone passeth ouer the signe called Gemini, and that for the most part the haires bee all kept and preserued. The Magi do also affirme that the skinne of an Hyaena being spread vpon a sore which was bit∣ten by a mad Dogge, Pliny doth presently and without any paine cure the same. The same also being bound to that part of the head, which doth ake, will imediately driue away the pain and griefe thereof. The same doth very effectually and speedily helpe them which are troubled with the gout, Albertus or swelling in the ioyntes. The flower of Barly being mingled with the blood of an Hyaena, and fryed or baked ouer the fire and so taken, doth very much asswage the wring∣ings and wrinchings either in the guts or belly of a man or woman. If the bloud of an Hy∣aena being whot be annointed on them which are infected with the Leprosie, it will with∣out delay very effectually cure them. Rasis The Hyaenes flesh being eaten doeth much auaile against the bitinges of rauenous Dogs: but some are of opinion that the liuer only being earen is of more force and pow∣er to cure or heale them. The Nerues or sinnewes of an Hyaena being beaten to small powder and dried and mingled with and Frankincence, together and so drunke, Plinius doth re∣store fertility and plenty of seede in that woman which before was barren. There is also for the biting of a rauenous dog another excellent remedy, which is this, first to annoint the place so bitten with the fat or greace of a Sea-calfe, or else to giue it in drinke, and then to make the operation more effectuall mingle the marrow of an Hyaena, Pliny. and oile that commeth from the Masticke tree and waxe together, and being so applyed and annointed vpon the sore it will presently cure the same. The same marrow of the Hy∣aena is very good and effectuall against the paine and griefe in the sinnewes, as also for the loosenesse and weakenesse of the raines. The marrow which proceedeth from the Chine-bone of an Hyaena, being mixed with his gall and old Oyle altogether, and so boiled vntill they come vnto a soft temperance, Democritus and mollifiyng medicine, being annointed vpon the sinnewes, doth expell and force away all paine of griefe thereof whatsoeuer. The same marrow being bound vnto the backe of either man or woman who are troubled with vaine fantasies or dreams in their sleep, doth very speedily and very effectually help them. The fat or greace of an Hyaena being burnt, doth driue away all venemous Serpentes from the place where it is so vsed. The same being mingled with leauen and so being wrought into a plaister is a very good cure or remedy for the falling of the haire, or the disease called the Foxes euill. Myrepsus The left part of the braine of an Hyaena being annointed vpon the nostrils of either men or beasts is of such vertue that it will cure diseases vpon them which are in maner mortall. For the sterility or barrennesse of women, the eye of an Hyaena being mixed with Lycoras, and the hearb called Dill, and so taken in drinke, is of such force and power, that in three daies it will make them fit for conception. The teeth of an Hyaena either touched or bound in order vnto the teeth of any man or woman who are troubled with the tooth-ach, will presently ease the paine and vexation thereof. One of the great teeth of an Hyaena being bound with a string vnto any that are troubled in the night tims with shadowes and fantasies, and which are frayed out of their sleepe with feareful visions, doth very speedily and effectually procure them ease and rest. The tooth of an Hyaena (called Alzabo ) being bound vppon the right arme of any one which is either obliuous or forgetfull, and hanging downe from the arme vnto the mid∣dle finger or wrist, doth renew and refresh their decayed memory. Albertus The pallat of an Hyaena being dryed and beaten to powder, and then mingled with Egyptian Allum, and so made whot and mixed altogether, being three times turned in a∣ny ones mouth which hath either fore or vlcer in it, will in smal time procure them reme∣dy and help of their vexation and trouble. The flesh which groweth vpon the hinder part of the necke being burned and then eaten or taken in drinke, doth very speedily helpe and cure the griefe and aches of the loines. The shoulders likewise being vsed in the aforesaid maner, doth profit much for the hea∣ling of any who are vexed with any anguish or paine in their shoulders or sides. The lungs being dryed and taken in drinke, do ease any either man or woman which is troubled with the Collick or stone. But being dryed into powder and mingled with Oyle and so annoin∣ted vpon the belly, it killeth the wormes and expelleth all aches away from the belly. The Hart being vsed in the aforesaid manner and taken in drinke, doth ease and help all aches, paines, or griefe in the body whatsoeuer. The white flesh being taken from the breast of an Hyaena, and seuen haires, and the genitall of a Hart, being bound altogether in the skin or hide of a buck or a Doe, and afterwards hanged about the neck of a woman which is in trauell, will greatly hinder her for bringing forth her child. If ther shal be any flesh or bones of men found in the body of a dead Hyaena, being dried and beaten to powder, and then mixed with a certaine perfume, they will bee very excel∣lent to help the gout, or driue away the conuulsion of the sinewes. The kell or caule wher∣in the bowels are contained, being vsed in the aforesaid manner and also mixed with oile will be a present remedy against the burnings and inflamations of sores, botches, and vl∣cers. The chine bone of an Hyaena being brused and beaten into small powder, and so dried, and then mingled with the tongue and the right foot of a Sea-calfe, the gall of an Oxe be∣ing added thereunto, Pliny. and all of them boiled or baked togither, and annointed vppon the hide or skinne of an Hyaena, and so lapped about the legges or ioyntes of them which are troubled with the gout, will in short time ease the paine, and ridde them altogether of the greefe thereof. The chine-bone being also beaten to powder and giuen in wine to drinke, is very pro∣fitable and necessary for those which are in sore trauaile or paine of childe-birth. The firste or eighth rib of the same beast, being beaten and mingled with a certaine perfume, is very good and medicinable for sores and botches which do breake thorough the flesh. Their flesh also being eaten, doth quickly cure and heal the bitings or tearings of a ra∣uenous Dogge, but the liuer being so vsed is more effectuall and speedy, for the curinge thereof. The liuer of the aforesaide beast is also very curable for Agues or Quarterne fea∣uers being beaten to powder and drunke in Wine, before the augmentation or second as∣saults thereof. The fame also is an excellent and speedy remedy for the wringings & aches of the belly, Dioscorides. as also for that grieuous and painefull disease called the collicke and stone. For the same diseases, the gall of a Sea Scorpion, and of a fish called Haelops, and of a sea crabbe and of an Hyaena, being beaten to powder, and mixed together, and so drunke in Wine, is a very good and effectual cure and help. Marcellus The gall of an Hyaena, by it self alone being rubd or anointed vpon the head of eyther man or woman whose haires are fallen off, doth pre∣sently procure the haire to renew and grow againe, it will also bring haire vpon the eie-lids, being rubbed thereupon. The gal of an Hyaena being mingled with hony, and annointed vpon the eies; doth shar∣pen and cleare the eye sight, and expell and driue away al blemishes and smal skins which couer the sight of the eye, as also the paine in the eies called the pinne and the webbe. But Apollonius Pitanaus doth say, Gallen that the gal of a Dog, being vsed in the aforesaide manner is better to cure the sight of the eies then the gal of an Hyaena. But Pliny whom I thinke best to follow, and worthiest to be belieued, doth best allow of the Hyaenaes gal for the aforesaid purpose, and also for the expelling of certaine white spottes in the eie which doe hinder the sight thereof. Marcellus. The gall of a Beare and of a Hyaena, being dried and beaten to pouder, and so mixed with the best hony which is possible to bee had, and then stirred vp and downe a long time togither, doth helpe them vnto their eye-sight which are starke blinde, if that it bee dailye annointed and spred vppon the eies for a reasonable space together: The gall of a Hyaena being baked in a cruse of Athenian hony, and mingled with the crooked hearbe Crocis, and so annointed vpon the browes or forehead of them which are purblind doth speedily helpe them; Pliny. it doth also ease them which are troubled with the water or rheume which falleth in the eies. Democritus doth also affirme that if the brow of either man or woman be annoin∣ted with the gall of an Hyaena onely, it will driue away all darkeninges, and blemishes, in the eies, and expell the Water or rhewme thereof, and also asswage the paine or greefe which may come or happen in them whatsoeuer it be. The marrow which proceedeth from the chine-bone of an Hyaena, being mixed with his owne gall, Marcellus and with old oile, and then baked or boiled in a cruse vntill it come vnto a tem∣perate and mollifying medicine, and then being laid or annointed vppon the sinnewes or Nerues who is in those parts troubled, wil thoroughly heale and cure any default or paine which may hapen thereunto. The gal of a male Hyaena being pounded or beaten and bound about the left thigh of any woman that is barren, doth help for conception. The gal of the same beast being drunke in wine to the value of a dram, with the decoction or liquor which commeth from Spike-Lauender called oyle of spike, is a very good remedy and helpe a∣gainst the timpany or swelling of the belly. The gall also being beaten and mixed with the stone called Eat-flesh, is very good & profitable for them which are trobled with the gout. The milt of an Hyaena is very effectual to cure and heale any paine or greefe in the milt of either man or woman. pliny. The lunges being dryed and beaten to powder, and mingled with oile, and annointed vpon the loynes of any one who is greeued or troubled in those places, will speedily cure the Aches or griefes thereof. The bladder of an Hyaena being drunke in wine, is a very good and effectuall remedy a∣gainst the incontinency of man or womans vrin, or the running of the raines. Marcellus But if there be any vrine in the blader of the Hyaena found when he is taken, let it be poured forth into some cleane vessell, and mixed with oyle which proceedeth from the pulse or corne of In∣dia, and so drunke vp, and it will much ease and help them who are troubled in mind, and are full of care and griefe. The secret partes of a femal Hyaena beaten and mixed with the nd or skin of a Pomgranate and taken in drinke is very profitable to cure the inconueni∣ nces or paine of a womans secret parts. The genitall of a male Hyaena dryed and beaten to powder, being mingled with a cer∣taine perfume, doth cure and help those which are troubled with the crampe, and conuul∣sion of the sinnewes. Dioscorides The feete of an Hyaena being taken doth heale and cure those which are sand-blind, and such as haue botches and sores breaking through the skin and flesh, and also such as are troubled with inflamations or breedings of winde in their bodies, on∣ly by touching and rubbing them ouer. The durt or dung which is found in the interior partes of an Hyaena, being burned, and dryed into powder and so taken in drinke is very medicinable and curable for those which are grieued with painful excoriatious and wringings of the belly, and also for those which are troubled with the bloody-flixe. And the same being mingled with Goose-grease and annointed ouer all the body of either man or woman, wil ease them of any paine or griefe which they haue vpon their body whatsoeuer. The dung or filth of an Hyaena also being mingled with certaine other medicins, is very excellent to cure and heale the bites and stingings of crocodiles and other venemous Serpents. The dung it selfe is also very good to purge and heale rotten wounds and sores which are full of matter, and filthy corrup∣tion. OF THE IBEX. T His beast Deuter. the 14. is called Ako▪ and is there rehear∣sed among the clean beasts, which although the Septuagints translate Tragelaphus, Of the name yet wee haue shewed already in that story, that it cannot stand with the meaning of the Holy-ghost, because that beast is found no where but neare the ry∣uer Phasis, or in Arabia (as Pliny and Diodorus write:) & be∣sides, the Chaldey translation hath Iaela, the Persians Kotz∣iotu, the Arabians Ohal, all which by Abraham Ezra, and Rabbi Salomon, and many other of the learned Iewes, are in∣terpreted to bee the Ibex, which of the Germans is called Steinbook, and the Female of the Heluetians is called Ybschen and Ybschgeiss, which words seemeth to be deriued from the Latine word Ibex, and the Cisalpine French, which speak Italian, dwelling about Millain, retain the German word for the Male, but the Femal by a proper word they call Vesina, and so also doe the Rhetians. The Transalpine French Bouc estane, the Illirians Kozoroziecz, and some latine Authors call him Capricornus. The Grae∣cians Ixalos and Aeigoceros ; Althogh I haue neuer read Capricornus to signifie a beast, A fiction of Capricornus but onely a star, excepting some poeticall Gramarians who affirme this beast to be a monster of the Sea, and that Pan when he fled out of Egypt with other Gods from Typhon the Gi∣ant, their great enemy, cast himselfe into the water, and was transformed into this beast. But Iupiter admiring his wit, placed him among the stars neare to Leo, according to this verse: Humidus Aeigoceros, nec plus Leo tollitur vrua. Although there be some that affirme, this Capricorne to be placed among the starres by Iupiter, because hee was nursed with him. And that Pan hath his hinder partes like a fish and his fore part like a Goat, according to these verses; Tum gelidum valido de pectore frrgus anhelaus, Corpore semifero, magno capricornus in orbe. Wherefore by the signes Cancer and Capricornus, the auncients were wont to vnderstand the descending and ascending of the soul: that is to say, by the Cancer or crab which go∣eth backe-ward, the soules descent; by the Capricorn, (because the Goat climbeth) the souls ascent: Porphyrius. and therefore they place it in the Zodiack, where the Sunne after the short daies beginneth to ascend, The attributs of this beast. Textor. for no other cause then for that which I haue rehearsed. The Epithets that are giuen vnto this Capricorne, doe also belong vnto the Ibex, such as are these, moist, cold, swift, horne-bearer, watery, snowy, wool-bearer, rough, bristly-cared, horrible, fierce, tropicke, frowning, showring, threatning, black, and such like. To returne therefore vnto the Ibex, although I doe not dislike the opinion of them, which take it to be a wilde-goat, Their Coun¦tries of breed and partes of their body. yet I haue reserued it into this place, because of many e∣minent difference as may appeare by the storie. First these are bred in the alpes, and are of an admirable celerity, although their heades bee loaded with such hornes, as no other beasts of their stature beareth. For I do read in Eustathius, that their hornes are sixteene palmes longe, or fiue spannes, and one palme, and sometimes seauen spans, such was the horne consecrated at Delos, being two cubits and a span long, and six and twenty pounds in weight. This beast (saith Polibius ) in his necke and haire is like a Bucke-goat, beating a beard vnder his chin of a span long, as thicke as a colts taile, and in other partes of his bo∣dy resembleth a Hart. It seemeth that his Haebrew name Iaall, The places of their a∣bode. is deriued of climbing, and ( Isidorus saith) that Ibices are quasi Auices, that is like Birdes, because like Fowles of the ayre, they enhabite the toppes of cliftes, Rockes, and Mountaines, farre from the viewe and sight of men. Their hornes reach to their Buttockes or Hippes, so that if at anye time hee doe chaunce to fal, he cowcheth his whole bodie betwixt his hornes, to breake the stronge force and violence of his owne weight, and also hee is able to receiue vppon his horns the stroks of great stones which are shot or cast at him; they are knotty and sharp, and as they encrease in age so do their horns in strongnesse and other qualities vntil they be twenty yeares old. These beasts inhabit and keepe their abode in the tops of those Mountaines, Stumptius. where the yee neuer thaweth or dissolueth, for it loueth cold by nature, otherwise it would be blind, The benefite of cold. for cold is agreeable to the eie-sight and beauty. It is a Noble beast and very fat. In the small head, and leane Legges, it resembleth a Hart, the eies are very faire and bright, Their seueral members. the colour yellowish, his hoofe clouen and sharpe like wilde Goates. It farre excelleth a wilde Goate in leaping, for no man will beleeue how farre off, or what long space it will leape ex∣cept he saw it. For there is no place so steep or cragged that if it affoord him but so much space as his foot may stand on but he will passe ouer it with a very few iumpes or leapes, Their taking The Hunters driue them to the smooth and high rockes, and there they by enclosing them take them in ropes or toyles, if they cannot come neere him with shot or Swords. When the beast seeth his Hunter which descendeth to him by some Rocke, he obserueth very diligently and watcheth if he can see any distance or space betwixt him and the rock; yea, but so much as his eye-sight can pierce through: and if he can, then he leapeth vppe and getteth betwixt the Hunter and the rocke, and so casteth him downe headlong and if he can espy no distance at all, then doeth he keepe his standing vntill hee be killed in that place. The hunting of this beast were very pleasant, but that it is encombred with much la∣bour and many perils, and therefore in these daies they kil them with Gunnes. The inhabi∣tants of Valois (neere the Ryuer Sedunus ) take them in their infancy when they are young and tame them, and vntill they be old they are contented to goe and come with the tame Goates to pasture, but in their older and riper age they returne to their former Wilde na∣ture. Aristotle affirmeth that they couple or engender together (not by leaping vpō each other) but standing vpright, vpon their hinder Legs, whereunto I cannot consent, Their copula¦tion. because the ioynts and Nerues of their hinder Legges will not be stretched to such a copulation; and it may be that he or his relatour had seene them playing together as Goates doe, standing vpright, and so tooke that gesture in their pastime for carnall copulation. The female hath lesse hornes then the male, but a greater body, and her hornes are very like to a Wilde Goates. When this beast feeleth infallible tokens of her death, Their beha∣uiour at their death. and perceiueth that her end by some wound or course of nature approcheth, and is at hand, it is reported by the hunters, that she ascendeth to the toppe of some Mountaine or high rocke, and there fasteneth one of her hornes in the same steepe place, going round continually and neuer standing still, vntill she haue worne that horne asunder, whereby she stayeth her selfe, and so at length at the instant or point of death, breaking her horne, falleth down and perisheth. And be∣cause they dye among the rockes, it falleth out seldome that their bodyes are found, but many times when the snow falleth from the Mountaines in great and huge Masses, it mee∣teth with a liuing Ibex and other wilde beastes, and so oppressing them driueth them down to the foot of the hils or Mountaines, as it doth trees and small houses, which are built vp∣on the sides of them. Pelagonius. In Creete they make bowes of the hornes of these beastes. the vse of their hornes. And concerning their taking it is not to be forgotten how the hunter which pursueth her from one rocke to another, is forced many times for the safegard of his own life, to forsake his standing, and to obserue the beast when it maketh force at him, and to rid himselfe from danger of death by lea∣ping vpon his back, and taking fast hold on his hornes, whereby he escapeth. In the house of Pompey where the memorable forrest of Gordianus was painted, there were amonge o∣ther beastes, two hundred Ibices, which Pompey gaue vnto the people at the day of his try∣umph, for to make spoile thereof at their owne pleasure. The medicines of the Ibex. Some do commend the blood of the Ibex to be a very good remedy against the stone of the bladder, being vsed in this manner: first, they deuide it in partes, and put one part of the blood, and about some sixe parts of wine Apiat and Hony mixed together, and doe boile them both together lukewarme, and afterwardes they reserue it in a cleane vessell, and the third day in the morning they giue it vnto the party to drinke who is grieued, and then they put him into a Bath about noone time, and in the euening, and this order is to obserued for three daies together, for it will come to passe that in that space the stone will be dissolued and turned into sand or grauell, and so by that meanes will haue vent toge∣ther with the vrine. There is also by the dung of the aforesaid beast, an excelent remedy against the Sciati∣ca or hippe-gout, by which that most excellent Physitian Ausonius himselfe was healed, and many other lying disperate of remedy, which is this; to gather the dunge of this beast in the seuenteeneth day of the Moone, neither is it any great matter whether you gather it in some part of the old Moone, for it wil haue the same operation: you shal ther∣fore take as much of this dung as you can hold in your hand or fist at one time: so that the quantity of the dung be vnlike, and you shall put it in a morter and beate it to powder, & cast twenty grains of pepper into the same fime, being very diligently pounded or brui∣sed, and then you shall adde nine ounces of the best hony vnto the aforesaid mixture, and foure pounds of the best wine, and mixe the potion in the manner of a compound wine, and the dung or durt being dryed and beaten first, you shall mingle all the rest and put them together in a vessell made of glasse, that when you haue any need you may haue the medicine ready prepared, to comfort him or her which is so afflicted. OF THE ICHNEVMON M Arcellus and Solinus, doe make question of this beast ( Ichneumon ) to be a kind of Otter, The kindes and names with the rea∣son thereof. or the Otter a kinde of this Ichneumon, which I find to be otherwise called Enydros or Enhydrus, because it liueth in water, & the reason of this name I take to be fetched ab infestigando, because like a dog or hunting-hound, it diligently searcheth out the seates of wilde beasts, especially the Crocodile and the Aspe, whose egges it destroyeth. And for the emnity vnto Serpents, it is called Ophiomachus. Isidorus is of opinion, that the name of this beast in the Greeke is giuen vnto it, because by the sauour thereof, the venom and wholsomenesse of meates is descryed. Whereof Dracontius writeth in this manner: Predicit suillus, vim cuiuscun{que} veneni. The Ichneumon foretelleth the power, and presence of all poyson. And it is called Suillas, in La∣tine, because like a hog, it hath bristles in stead of haire; Albertus also doth call it Ne m n, mistaking it for Ichneumon. Hermolaus. Gyllius. There be some that call it an Indian Mouse, because there is some proportion for simi∣litude in the outwarde forme betweene this beast and a mouse. But it is certaine, that it is bred in no other Nation but onely in Egypt, about the riuer Nilus, and of some it is called Mus Pharonis, Pharoes Mouse. For Pharo was a common name to all the Egyptian kings. There be some that call it Thyamon, Albertus. Ʋincentius. and Anschycomon, and also Damula, mistaking it for that Weasell which is an enemy to Serpentes, called by the Italians Donola : yet I know no learned man but taketh these two names, to signifie two defferent Beastes. The quanti∣ty of it or ture is sometimes as greate as a small Catte or Ferret, and the haires of it like the haires of a Hogge; The quanti∣ty and seue∣rall partes. the eyes small and narrow, which signifie a malignant and crafty disposition; the taile of it very long like a Serpentes, the end turning vppe a little, hauing no haires but scales, not much vnlike the taile of a Mouse. Aelianus affirmeth, Their procr ¦ation and fights one with ano∣ther. that both sexes beare young, hauing seed in themselues, whereby they conceiue. For those that are ouercome in combates one with another, are branded with a warlicke marke of Villanage, or subiection to their Conquerors, and on the contrary side they which are con¦quered and ouercome in fight, do not only make vassals of them whom they ouercome, but in token thereof for further punishment, fill them with their seede by carnall copula∣tion, so puttnig off from themselus to them, the dolours and Torments of bearing yong. When it is angry the haires stande vpright, and appeare of a double colour, bee∣ing white and yellowish by lines or rowes in equall distaunce, entermingled, and also very harde, and sharpe, like the haire of a Wolfe, the body is something longer This first picture of the Ichneumon was taken by Bellonius, except the backe be too much eleuated. The second picture taken out of Oppianus poems, as it was found in an old manuscript. then a Cats, and better set or compacted; the beake blacke, and sharp at the Nose like a Ferret, and without a beard, the eares short and round, the Legges blacke, hauing fiue clawes vpon his hinder feete, whereof the last or hinmost of the inner side of the foote is very short, his taile thicke towardes the rumpe: the tongue, teeth, and stones, are like a Cats, and this it hath peculiar, namly a large passage, compassed about with haire, on the outside of his excrement hole like the genitall of a woman, which it neuer openeth but in extremity of heat, the place of his excrements remaining shut, onely being more hollow then at other times. And it my be that the Authors aforesaid had no other reason to af∣firme the mutation of feeble or common transmigration of genitall power, beside the obseruation of this natural passage in male, & female. They bring forth as many as Cats & Dogs, and also eate them when they are young: they liue both in land and water, and take the benifit of both elements, but especially in the Riuer Nilus, amongst the reedes, grow∣ing on the bankes thereof, The places of their abod according to the saying of Nemetian ; Et placidis Ichneumona quaerere ripis, Inter arundineas segetes. For it will diue in the Water like an Otter, and seeme to be vtterly drowned, holding in the breath longer then any other foure-footed beast, as appeareth by his long keeping vnder Water, The courage and strength of this beast. and also by liuing in the belly of the Crocodile, vntill he deliuer forth him∣selfe, by eating through his bowels, as shall be shewed afterwards. It is a valiant and nim∣ble creature, not fearing a great Dogge, but setteth vpon him and biting him mortally, but especially a Cat, for it killeth or strangleth her with three bites of her teeth, and be∣cause her beake or snout is very narrow or smal, it canot bite any thing, except it bee lesse then a mans fist. The proportion of the body is much like a Badgers, and the nose hangeth ouer the mouth, like as it were alwaies angry; The nature of it is finding the Crocodile a sleepe, Hir entrance into a Croco¦dile. suddenly to run downe into his throat and belly, and there to eate vppe that meate which the Crocodile hath deuoured, and not returning out againe the way it went in, ma∣keth a passage for it selfe through the beasts belly. The taming of Ichneu∣mons. And because it is a great enemy and deuourer of Serpents, the common people of that Country do tame them, and keepe them familiarly in their houses like Cats, for they eat Mice, and likewise bewray all venemous beastes: for which cause as is said before, they cal it Pharoes Mouse by way of excellency. At Alexandria they sell their young ones in the Market, and nourish them for profit: It is a little beast, and maruelously studious of puri∣ty and clenlinesse. Bellonius affirmeth that he saw one of them at Alexandria, amongst the ruines of an olde castle, which suddenly tooke a Hen and eate it vp, for it loueth all manner of foules, especi∣ally Hens and chickens, Their foode. being very wary and crafty about his prey, oftentimes standing vpright vpon his hinder Legs, looking about for a fit booty, and when it espieth his prey neare him, Their subtil∣ty in obtai∣ning their prey. it slideth so close to the grounde, as is very admirable vntill it bee within the reach, & then leapeth vpon it with incredible celerity, dying to the throat, & like a Lyon killeth al by strangling. It eateth indifferently euery liuing thing, as Snales, Lizardes, ca∣melions, all kinds of Serpents, Frogs, Mice, and Aspes. For Strabo saith, when he findeth an Aspe by the water side, it ketcheth hold on the taile, and so draweth the beast into the Water, & receiueth help from the fluds to deuour her enemy, and whereas we haue saide already, that the Ichneumon entreth into the belly of the crocodil, Ammianus, Marcelinus, Strabo, Pliny, and Oppianus, maketh thereof this discourse following. When the croco∣dile hath filled his belly, and ouerglutted himselfe with meate, he commeth to the land to sleepe. Now there is in Egypt, a certaine Bird called Crochillus, whose nature is to wait vpon the crocodile, and with her breath and clawes gently and with a kind of delight, to pul out the remnants of the meate sticking in the crocodiles teeth, wherewithall the crocodile be∣ing pleased, openeth his mouth wide, to be thus clensed by this Bird, and so falling fast a sleepe gaping, watched all the while by the vigilent eie of the Ichnumon, perceiuing him, to be deeply plunged, in a sencelesse security, goeth presently and walloweth in sand and durt, & with a singular confidence entereth into the gate of death, that is the crocodiles mouth, and suddenly pierceth like an arrow through the monsters wide throat downe in∣to his belly. The CROCODILE feeling this vnlooked for euill, awaketh out of sleep, The Croco∣diles behaui∣or feeling the Ichneu∣mon in her belly. and in a rage or madnesse, voide of counsell, runneth too and fro, farre and wide, plunging himselfe in∣to the bottome of the riuer, where finding no ease, returneth to lande againe, and there breatheth out his vntolerable poison, beating himselfe with all his power, striuing to bee deliuered from this vnsufferable euil. But the Ichneumon careth not for al this, sitting close vpon the liuer of the CROCODILE, and feeding full sweetly vppon his intrals, vntill at last being satisfied, eateth out her owne passage through the belly of her hoast. The selfe same thing is related by Plutarch : but I wonder for what cause the beast should rowle her selfe in sand and durt, to enter into the CROCODILES belly; For first of all, if after her roling in the durt, she dry her selfe in the Sunne, yet will not that hard crust be any suffi∣cient armour of proofe to defend her small body from the violence of the Crocodiles teeth, and besides, it encreaseth the quantity of her body, making her more vnfit to slide downe through the Crocodiles narrow throate: and therefore, the Authors cannot be but deceaued in ascribing this quality to her, when she is to enter into the crocodile, but rather I beleeue, she vseth this defence against the Aspe, as Aristotle saith, and therefore the Author seeing her so couered with mudde, might easily be mistaken in her purpose. Their com∣bates with Aspes. For it is true indeed that when she seeth the Aspe vpon the land, she calleth her fellowes, who arme themselues as beforesaid before the combat, by which meanes they are safely preserued, from the bitings of their enemies; or if it be true that they wallow themselues in the mudde, they doe not dry themselues in the Sunne, but while their bodies are moist, slide downe more easily into the Crocodiles belly. Concerning their fighting with Aspes, and the arming of themselues as aforesaid, the Aegyptians make this hyrogliphicke of the Ichnumon, to signifie a weake man, that wan∣teth and craueth helpe of others; Pliny also saith that when the Aspe fighteth with this beast, the Ichnumon turneth to her, her taile, which the Aspe taking for defiance, present∣ly maketh force at it, whereby she is ouertaken and destroyed by the Ichnumon, but in my opinion this combate is better expressed by Oppianus. For saith he, the Ichnumon couereth her body in the sande as it were in a graue, leauing nothing vncouered but her long Serpentine taile, and hir eyes, and so expecteth her ene∣my. When the Aspe espyeth her threatning rage, presently turning about her taile, pro∣uoketh the Ichnumon to combate, and with an open mouth and lofty head doeth enter the list, to her owne perdition. For the Ichnumon being nothing affraid of this great brauado, receiueth the encounter, and taking the head of the Aspe in his mouth, biteth that off, to preuent the casting out of her poison: afterwardes tearing her whole body in pieces, al∣though gathered together wound in a circle, for the successe of these two combatants, ly∣eth in the first blow. If the Aspe first bite the Ichnumon, then doth her poison destroy her aduersary; and so on the contrary, if the Ichnumon first bite the Aspe, then is the Ichnumon conqueror, and for this cause she couereth her body as aforesaid. Furthermore, this Beast is not onely enemy to the crocodile and Aspe, but also to their Egges, which she hunteth out by the sagacity of her nose, and so destroyeth them, Their enmi∣ty to al kinds of Serpentes, and their egs yet doth she not eat them: whereby the mercifull prouidence of God doth notablye ap∣peare, for the sauegard of mankind, which in those countries where these noisome beasts are bred, hath prouided such an enemy to destroy them, both egs, & birds, as is friend∣ly and tameable by the hand and wit of man. For which cause the blind Pagans, consecrated this beast to Lat na, and Lugina, and the Heracleopolites did thinke that they possessed all religion; the Aegyptians themselues did worship them, because as their countrey is aboue all other plagued with serpents, so they are much eased by the helpe of this little beast. And when they die, they doe not onely lament them, but also bury them religiously. And thus much for the description of the Ichnumon. Now followeth their medicinal vertues. The medicines of the Ichneumon. The skinne of the Ichneumon, being dried and beaten into small powder, afterwards mingled with wine vineger, and annointed vpon those which are grieued with the veni∣mous or poyson some bites of the same beast, doth very effectually and speedily cure them of the same. Pliny The pretious stone called by the name of Iris, which is very hard, as Ho∣rus saith, being burned and afterward beaten or pounded into powder, is an excellent re∣medie against the venemous biting of the Ichneumon. It is also said that all beastes (but especially the Crocadile ) doe for the most part hate and detest the societie of this beast. There is moreouer a very rancke and venemous poyson, which proceedeth from the ge∣nitall or groine of this beast. The haires of the Ichneumon, Auicenna being taken in a certaine perfume, doth very much helpe and cure those which are troubled or grieued with the Maw-wormes. The dung of a Cat, or the dung of this beast▪ is very medicinable to be put in any salue, or potion, for the strenghthening, and confirming of the body. The vrine or taile of an Ichneumon, being mixed with the milke of a blacke Cow, & giuen vnto those which are troubled with that grieuous disease, Marcellus called the collicke and stone for the space of three daies together in any kinde of drinke will easily and speedily cure them of their paine. The stones of an Ichneu∣mon, being either beaten in powder, or taken raw, either in wine or any other drinke, is very medicinable, and curable for the easing of all such as are troubled or greiued with any ache, Herodotus paine, or disease in their belly; And thus much shall suffice concerning the cures, and medicines, of the Ichneumon. OF THE LAMIA. The signifi∣cation of the word Lamia. T His word Lamia hath many significations, being taken some∣times for a beast of Lybia, sometimes for a fish, and some∣times for a Spectre or apparition of women called Phairies. And from hence some haue ignorantly affirmed, that ei∣ther there were no such beastes at all, or else that it was a compounded monster of a beast and a fish, whose opinions I will briefly set downe. Aristophanes affirmeth, that he heard one say, that he saw a great wilde beast hauing seuerall parts resembling outwardly an Oxe, and inwardly a Mule, and a beautifull woman, which he called afterwards Empusa. When Appollonius and his companions trauailed in a bright Moone shine night, they saw a certaine apparition of Phairies, Visions o Phairie . in latine called Lamiae, and in Greeke Empusa, chang∣ing themselues from one shape into another, being also sometimes visible, and present∣ly vanishing out of sight againe: as soone as he perceaued it, he knew what it was and did rate it with very contumelious and despightfull words, exhorting his fellowes to do the like, Philostratus. for that is the best remedie against the inuasion of Phairies. And when his compa∣nions did likewise raile at them, presently the vision departed away. The Poets say, The poetical Lamia. that Lamia was a beautifull woman, the daughter of Bellus and Lybia, which Iupiter -loued, bringing her out of Lybia into Italie, where he begot vpon hir ma∣ny sonnes, but Iuno iealous of her husband, destroied them as soone as they were horne, punishing Lamia also with a restlesse estate, that she should neuer be able to sleepe, but liue night and day in continuall mourning, Varinus for which occasion she also stealeth away and killeth the children of others, whereupon came the fable of changing of children▪ Iu∣piter hauing pitty vpon her, gaue exe ptile eyes that might be taken in and out at hir own pleasure, & likewise power to be tranformed into what shape she would: And from hence also came the fained names of Acho, and Alphito, wherewithall women were wont to make their children afeard, according to these verses of Lucilius. Terricolas Lamias, fauni quas Pompilij{que} Instituere numae tremit has, &c. The true picture of the Lamia. Of these, Angelus Policianus relateth this old wiues story, Old Wiues tales of Phai¦ries. in his preface vppon Aristotles first booke of Analitickes, that his grand-mother tolde him when he was a childe, there were certaine Lamiae in the wildernes, which like Bug-beares would eat vp crying boies, and that there was a little Well neare to Fesulanum, being very bright, yet in continuall shaddow, neuer seeing Sun, where these Phairy women haue their habitation, which are to be seene of them which come thither for water. Plutarch also affirmeth, that they haue exemptile eies as aforesaid, and that as often as they go from home, they put in their eies, wandring abroad by habitations, streetes, and crosse waies, entring into the assemblies of men, and prying so perfectly into euery thing, that nothing can escape them, be it neuer so well couered: you wil thinke (saith hee) that they haue the eies of Kites, for there is no smal mote but they espie it, nor any hole so se∣cret but they find it out, and when they come home againe, at the very entrance of their howse they pul out their eies, and cast them aside, so being blinde at home, but seeing a∣broad. If you ask me (saith he) what they do at home, they sit singing and making of wool, and then turning his speech to the Florentines speaketh in this manner: Vidisti sue obsecro Lamias ist as vtri Florentini, quae se & sua nesciunt, alios & aliena speculantur, negati atqui tamen sunt in vrbibus frequentes verum personalae incaedunt homines credas, lamiae sunt : that is to say: O ye Florentines, did you euer see such Phairies, which were busie in prying in∣to the affaires of other men, but yet ignorant of their own? Do you denie it, yet do there commonly walke vppe and downe the Cittie, phairies in the shapes of men. There were two women called Macho, and Lamo, which were both foolish and madde, and from the strange behauiours of them, came the first opinion of the Pharies: there was also an auncient Lybian woman called Lamia, and the opinion was, that if these Pha∣ries had not whatsoeuer they demaunded, presently they would take away liue children, according to these verses of Horace. Nec quodcunque volet, poscat, sibi fabula credi Neu pransae Lamiae viuum puerum extrahat aluo. It is reported of Menippus the Lycian, A story of a Phairie wo∣man. that he fell in loue with a strange woman, who at that time seemed both beautifull, tender, and rich, but in truth there was no such thing, and all was but a fantasticall ostentation; she was said to insinuate her selfe into his fami∣liaritie, after this manner, as he went vpon a day alone from Corinth to Cenchrea hee met with a certaine phantasme or spectre like a beautifull woman, who tooke him by the hand, and told him that she was a Phoenicean woman, and of long time had loued him dearely, hauing sought many occasions to manifest the same, but could neuer finde opportunitie vntill that day, wherefore she entreated him to take knowledge of her house which was in the Suburbes of Corinth, therewith all pointing vnto it with her finger, and so desired his presence: The young man seeing himselfe thus wooed by a beautifull woman was easily ouercome by her allurements, and did oftentimes frequent her company. Ther was a certaine wise man and a Philosopher which espied the same, and spake vn∣to Moenippus in this manner. O formose, & aformosis, expetitie mulieribus, ophin thalpies, cai se ophis? that is to say, O faire Menippus beloued of beautifull women, art thou a ser∣pent and dost nourish a serpent? by which words he gaue him his first admonition, or in∣cling of a mischiefe; but not preuayling, Menippus purposed to marry with this spectre, her house to the outward shew being richly furnished with all manner of houshold goods, then said the wise man againe vnto Menippus, this gold, siluer, and ornaments of house, are like to Tantalus Apples, who are said by Homer to make a faire shew, but to containe in them no substance at all: euen so whatsoeuer you conceaue of this riches, there is no matter or substance in the things which you see, for they are onely inchaunted images and shadowes, which that you may beleeue, this your neate bride is one of the Empus , called Lamioe or Mormolicioe wonderfull desirous of copulation with men, and louing their flesh aboue measure, but those whom they doe entice, with their veneriall marts, afterwards they deuoure without loue or pittie, feeding vpon their flesh: at which words the wise man caused the gold and siluer plate and houshold stuffe, Cookes and seruants, to vanish all away; Then did the spectre like vnto one that wept, entreate the wise man that he would not torment her, nor yet cause her to confesse what manner of person she was, Coelius but he on the other side being inexorable, compelletd her to declare the whole truth, which was, that she was a Phairy, and that she purposed to vse the companie of Menippus, and feede him fat with all manner of pleasures, to the entent that afterward she might eate vp and deuour his body, for all their kinde loue was but onely to feede vpon beautifull yong men. These and such like stories and opinions there are of Phairies, which in my iudgement arise from the praestigious apparitions of Deuils, whose delight is to deceiue and beguile the minds of men with errour, The true de∣finition of Phairies. contrary to the truth of holye Scripture, which doeth no where make mention of such inchaunting creatures; and therefore if any such be, we will holde them the workes of the Deuill, and not of God, or rather I beleeue, that as Poets call Harlots by the name of Charibdis, which deuoureth and swalloweth whole shippes and Nauies, aluding to the insatiable gulph of the Sea, so the Lamiae are but poeticall alligo∣ries of beautifull Harlottes, who after they haue had their lust by men, doe many times deuour and make them away, as we read of Diomedes daughters, and for this cause also Harlots are called Lupae, shee-Wolues, and Lepores, Hares. To leaue therefore these fables, Their names and descrip∣tion. and come to the true description of the Lamia, we haue in hand. In the foure and thirty chapter of Esay, we do find this beast called Lilith in the Haebrew, and translated by the auncients' Lamia, which is there threatned to possesse Ba∣bell. Likewise in the fourth chapter of the Lamentations, where it is said in our English translation, that the Dragons lay forth their brests, in Haebrew they are called Eiha , which by the confession of the best interpreters, cannot signifie Dragons, but rather sea-calues, being a generall word for strange wilde beasts. Howbeit the matter being wel ex∣amined, it shall appeare that it must needes be this Lamia, because of her great breastes, which are not competible, either to the Dragon or Sea-calues; so then we wil take it for graunted, by the testimony of holy Scripture, that there is such a beast as this Crisostom∣us. Dion also writeth that there are such beasts in some part of Libia, hauing a Womans face, and very beautifull, also very large and comely shapes on their breasts, such as can∣not bee counterfeited by the art of any painter, hauing a very excellent colour in their fore parts without wings, and no other voice but hissing like Dragons: they are the swiftest of foote of all earthly beasts, so as none can escape them by running, for by their celerity they compasse their prey of beastes, and by their fraud they ouerthrow men. For when as they see a man, they lay open their breastes, and by the beauty thereof, entice them to come neare to conference, and so hauing them within their compasse, they deuoure and kill them: vnto the same things subscribe Coelius and Giraldus, adding also, that there is a certaine crooked place in Libia neare the Sea-shore, full of sand like to a sandy Sea, and all the neighbor places thereunto are deserts. If it fortune at any time, that through shipwrack men come there on shore, these beasts watch vppon them, deuouring them all, which either endeuour to trauell on the land, or else to returne backe againe to Sea, adding also that when they see a man they stand stone still, and stir not til he come vnto them, looking down vpon their breasts or to the ground, whereupon some haue thought, they seeing them at the first sight, haue such a desire to come neare them, that they are drawne into their compasse, by a certaine naturall magi∣call witch-crafte: but I cannot approue their opinions, either in this or in that, wherein they describe him with horsses feet, and hinder parts of a serpent, but yet I graunt that he doth not onely kill by biting, but also by poysoning, feeding vpon the carcasse which hee hath deuourd: His stones are very filthy and great, and smel like a Sea-calues, for so Ari∣stophnies writing of Cleon a Corior, and lustfull man, compareth him to a Lamia, in the greatnesse and filthinesse of his stones, the hinder parts of this beast are like vnto a Goate, his fore legs like a Beares, his vpper parts to a woman, the body scaled all ouer like a Dra∣gon as some haue affirmed by the obseruation of their bodies, when Probus the Emperor brought them forth into publike spectacle: also it is reported of them, that they deuoure their own young ones, and therefore they deriue their name Lamia of Laniando, and thus much for this beast. OF THE LYON. B Eing now come to the discourse of the Lyon (iustly stiled by all writers the King of beastes,) I cannot chuse but remember that prettie fable of Esope, concerning the societie and honor due vn∣to this beast. For (saith he) the Lyon, Asse, and the Fox entered league and friendship together, and foraged abroad to seeke con∣uenient booties, at last, hauing found one and taken the same, the Lyon commanded the Asse to make deuision thereof, the silly Asse regarding nothing but societie and friendship, and not honor and dignitie, parted the same into three equall shares; one for the Lyon, an other for the Fox, and the third for himselfe: Whereat the Lyon disdaining, because hee had made him equall vnto the residue, presently fell vpon him and toare him in peeces; then bidding the Fox to make the deuision, the craftie Fox deuided the prey into two parts, assigning vnto the Lyon almost the whole bootie, and reseruing to himselfe a very small portion; which being allowed by the Lyon, he asked him, who taught him to make such a partiti∣on, marry (quoth the Fox) the calamitie of the Asse, whom you lately toare in peeces. In like manner I would be loath to be so simple, in sharing out the discourse of the Lyon, as to make it equall with the treatise of the beasts lately handled, but rather accor∣ding to the dignitie thereof, to expresse the whole nature, in a large and copious tractate. For such is the rage of illiterate or else enuious men, that they would censure me with as great seueritie, if I should herein like an Asse forget my selfe (if I were in their power) as the Lyon did his colleague for one foolish partition. And therefore as when Lisimacus, the sonne of Agathocles, being cast by Alexander to a Lyon to be destroyed, because he had giuen poyson to Calistines the Philosopher, that was for the ending of his miserie, who was included by the said Alexander in a caue to be famished to death; vpon some sleight displeasure the said Lisimacus, being so cast vnto the Lyon, did not like a cowardly person offer himselfe to his teeth, but when the Lyon came gaping at him to deuoure him, hauing wrapped his arme in his linnen garment, held him fast by the tongue, vntill he stopped his breath, and slew him; for which cause, he was euer afterwards the more loued and honored of Alexander, hauing at the time of his death, the commaund of all his treasure. In like sort I will not be afraid, to handle this Lyon, and to looke into him both dead and aliue, for the expressing of so much of his nature, as I can probably gather out of any good writer. First of all therefore to begin with his seuerall names, The seuerall names of Lions. almost all the nations of Europe doe follow the Greekes in the nomination of this beast, for they call him Leon, the La∣tines, Leo, the Italians Leone, the French and English Lyon, the Germans and Illirians, Leuv ; the reason of the Greeke name Leon, is taken para To luessein from the excellencie of his sight; for Laio signifieth to see, and Alaoos signifieth blind, for indeede there is no creature of the quantitie of a Lyon, that hath such an admirable eie fight. The Lionesses called in Greeke Loena which word the Latines follow, from whence also they deriue Lea for a Lionesse, according to this verse of Lucretius : Irritata Leae, iaciebant corpora saltu. The Hebrewes haue for this beast male and female, and their younge ones diuers names: and first of all for the male Lion, in Deut. the 33. they haue Ari, and Arieh, where the Caldians translate it Ariauan, the Arabians Asad, the Persians Gehad, and plurally in He∣brew Araijm, Araiot, Araoth, as in the first of Zeph. Araoth, Schoianim, roaring Lions: and from hence comes Ariel, signifying valiant and strong, to be the name of a Prince: and Isai 29. Ezec. 43. it is taken for the alter of burnt offerings, because the fier that came downe from heauen, did continually lye vpon that altar, like a Lion in his denne: or else because the fashion of the temple was like the proportion of the Lion: the Assirians call a Lionesse Arioth, the Hebrewes also call the male Lion Labi, and the female Lebia, and they distinguish Art, and Labi, making Ari to signifie a little Lion, and Labia a great one; and in Num. 23. in this verse, containing one of Gods promises to the people of Israell for victory against their enemies, Behold my people shall arise like Labi, and be lifted vp like Ari : there the Chaldey translation rendereth Labi, Leta, the Arabian Iebu, the Persians Scher, and Munster, saith that Labi is an old Lyon. In Iob. 38. Lebaim signifieth lions, and in Psa. the 57. Lebaot signifieth Lionesses. In the Prophet Naum the 2. Laisch is by the Hebrewes translated a Lyon, and the same worde Esa. the 30. is by the Chaldies translated a lions Whelpe; and in the aforesaid place of the prophet Naum, you shal find Arieh for a lion, Labi for a lionesse, Cephirim for little lions, and Gur for a lions whelp, all contained vnder one period. The seueral kinds of Ly∣ons. The Sarazens cal a Lion at this day Sebey, and thus much for the name. In the next place we are to consider the kindes of Lyons, and those are according to Aristotle two, the first of a lesse and well compacted body, which haue curled manes, being therefore called Acro leontes, and this is more sluggish and fearefull then the other. The second kind of Lyon hath a longer body, and a deeper lose hanging mane, these are more noble, generous, and couragious against all kind of wounds. And when I speak of manes it must be remembred, that all the male Lyons are maned, but the females are not so; neither the Leopards which are begotten by the adultry of the lyonesse: for from the ly∣on there are many beasts which receiue procreation, as the Leopard or Panther. There is a beast called Leontophonus, a little creature in Syria, and is bred no wher els but where lyons are generated. Of whose flesh if the lion tast, he looseth that princely po∣wer which beareth rule among foure footed-beasts, and presently dyeth; for which cause they that lie in waite to kill lyons, Ʋarinus. Hesychius take the body of this Leontophonus, which may well bee englished Lion-queller, and burneth it to ashes, afterwards casting those ashes vpon flesh, whereof if the lion tast she presently dyeth, so great is the poyson taken out of this beast for the destruction of lyons; for which cause, the lyon doth not vndeseruedly hate it, and when she findeth it, although she dare not touch it with her teeth, yet she teareth it in pie∣ces with her clawes. The vrine also of this beast sprinkled vppon a lyon doeth wonderfully harme him, if it doth not destroy him; They are deceiued that take this Lion-queller to be a kind of Worme, or reptile creature, for there is none of them that render vrine; but this excrement is meerely proper to foure-footed-liuing-beastes: And thus much I thought good to say of this beast in this place, which I haue collected out of Aristotle, Pliny, Soli∣nus, Aelianus. and other Authors aforesaide, although his proper place be afterward among the li∣ons enemies. The Chimaera is also fained to be compounded of a lion, a Goate, and a Dragon, accor∣ding to this verse: Prima leo, postrema Draco, media ipsa Chimaera. There be also many Fishes in the great Sea, about the Ile Taprabones, hauing the heades of Lyons, Panthers, Rams, and other beasts. The Tygers of Prasia are also engendred of Lyons, and are twice so big as they. There are also Lyons in India, (called Formicae ) about the bignesse of Egyptian Wolues. Camalopardales haue their hinder parts like Lyons. The Mantichora hath the body of a Lyon: The Leucrocuta, the necke, taile, and brest like a lion, and there is an allogorical thing cald ( Demonium Leoninum ) a lyon-Diuel, which by Bellu∣nensis, is enterpreted to be an allegory, signifieng the mingling together reasonable vnder∣standing with malicious hurtfull actions. Monsters breed like Ly¦ons. It is reported also by Aelianus, that in the Iland of Choos, a sheepe of the flock of Nicippus, contrary to the nature of those beasts, in stead of a lamb brought forth a lion, which monstrous prodigy was seene and considred of ma∣ny, whereof diuers gaue their opinions what it did pretend, namely that Nicippus, of a pri∣uate man should effect superiority and become a tyrant, which shortly after cam to passe, for he ruled all by force and violence, Coelins. not with fraud or mercy; for Fraus (saith Cicero ) quasi vulpeculae, vis leonis esse videtur, that is: Fraud is the property of a Foxe, and violence of a Lion. Heroditus. It is reported that Meles the first King of Sardis did beget of his concubine a lyon, & the South-sayers told him that on what side soeuer of the city he should lead that lion, it shold remaine inexpugnable, and neuer be taken by any man; whereupon Meles led him about euery tower and rampier of the citty, which hee thought was weakest, except onely one Tower, standing towards the riuer Tmolus, because hee thought that side was inuincible, and could neuer by any force be entred, scaled, or ruinated. Afterwards in the raigne of Crasus, the Citty was taken in that place by Darius. There are no lions bred in Europ, except in one part of Thrasia, for the Nemaeon, Countries without Ly∣ons. or Cle∣onaean lion is but a fable; yet in Aristotles time, ther were more famous & valiant lions in that part of Europe, lying betwixt the Riuers Achelous and Nessus, then in all Affrica and Asia. For when Xerxes led his Army through Paeonia ouer the Riuer Chidorus, the lyons came and deuoured his Camels in the night time; but beyonde Nessus towardes the East, or Achillous towards the West, there was neuer man saw a lion in Europe: but in the region betwixt them which was once called the countrey of the Abderites, there were such store, that they wandered into Olimpus, Macedonia, and Thessalia, but yet of purpose Princes in castles and Towers for their pleasures sake, do nourish and keepe Lions in Europe, where sometimes also they breed, as hath been seene both in England and Florence; Pelloponesus also hath no lions, and therefore when Homer maketh mention of Dianaes hunting in the mountaines of Frimanthus and Taygetus, he speaketh not of lions, but of Harts and Bores. All the countries in the East and South, lying vnder the heate of the Sun, do plenti∣fully breede lions, and except in whot countries they breed seldome, and therefore the li∣ons of Fesse, Temesna, Angad, Hippo, and Tunis, are accounted the most noble and auda∣tious lions of Affrick, because they are whot countries. Countries of their breed. But the lions of colder countries haue not halfe so much strength, stomack, and courage. These Libian lions haue not halfe so bright haire as others, their face and necke, are very horrible rough, making them to looke fearefully, and the whole collour of their bodies betwixt browne and blacke; Apo∣lonius saw lions also beyond Nilus, Hiphasis, and Ganges : and Strabo affirmeth that there are lions about Meroe, Astapae, and Astabore, which lions are very gentle, tame, and fearefull, and when the dog star called ( Canis Sirius ) doth appear, wherof commeth the dog daies, that then they are droue awaie by the bitings of great gnats. Aethiopia also breedeth Lyons, being blacke coloured, hauing great heads, long hair, rough feet, fiery eies, and their mouth betwixt red and yellow. Silicia, Armenia, and Par∣thia, about the mouth of Ister, breed many feareful Lyons, hauing great heads, thick and rough neckes and cheekes, bright eies, and eye-lids hanging down to their noses. There are also plenty of lyons in Arabia, so that a man cannot trauell neare the citty Aden ouer the mountaines, with any security of life, except he haue a hundred men in his company. The Lions also of Hircania are very bold and hurtfull, and India the mother of al kinde of beasts, hath most blacke, fierce, and cruell Lyons. In Tartaria also, and the kingdome of Narsinga, and the Prouince of Abasia, are many Lyons, greater then those of Babilon and Siria ; of diuers and sunrdy intermingled colours, both white, blacke and red. Vartomanus There be many Lyons also in the prouince of Gingui, so that for feare of them, men dare not sleep out of their owne houses in the night time. For whomsoeuer they find they deuoure and teare in pieces. The ships also which go vp and downe the riuer, are not tyed to the bank∣side for feare of these lions, because in the night time they come downe to the Water∣side, and if they can find any passage into the barkes, they enter in, and destroy euery ly∣uing creature, wherefore they ride at Ancor in the middle of the riuer. The colour of Lyons is generally yellowe, for these before spoken of, blacke, white, The colour of Lyons. and red are exorbitant: Their haire some of them is curled, and some of them long, shag∣gy, and thin, not standing vpright, but falling flatte, longer before, and shorter behinde, cardanus and although the curling of his haire be a token of sluggish timidity, yet if the haire bee long and curled at the top onely, it pretendeth generous animosity. So also if the haire be hard: (for beasts that haue soft haire, as the Hart, the Hare, & the Sheep), are timerous, but they which are harder haired, as the Boare and the Lyon, are more audacious and fearelesse. There is no foure-footed beaste, that hath haires on his neather eye-liddes like a man, but in steede thereof, either their face is rough all ouer as in a Dogge, or else they haue a foretop as a horse and an Asse, or a mane like a lion. The Lyonesse hath no mane at all, for it is proper to the male, and as long haires are an ornament to a horses mane, so are they to the necke and shoulders of a Lyon; neither are they eminent but in their full age, and therefore Pliny said: Turrigeros elephantorum miramur humeros, leonum iubas. We wonder at the Tower-bearing shoulders of Elephantes, and the long hanging manes of Lions. And Aelianus in orationis expertibus maripraestantiam quandam natura largita est, iuba leo antaecellit foeminam, serpens Christa. Nature hath honored the Male, euen in crea∣tures without reason, to be distinguished from the female, as the mane of the male Lyon, and the combe of the male Serpent do from their females. Martiall writeth thus of the li∣ons mane: O quantum per colla decus, quem sparsit honorem, Aurea lunatae cum stetit vnda iubae? A Lyon hath a most valiant and strong head, The seueral parts. and for this occasion, when the Nymphes were terrified by the Lyons and fled into Carystus, the promontory wherein they dwelled was called Co leon, that is the Lyons-head, where afterwards was built a goodly Citty. It fortuned as Themistocles went thether to manage the affaires of the Graecians, Epiries the Persian, president of Phrygia intended his destruction, and therefore committed the busines vnto one Pisis, with charge that he shold behead Themistocles, who came thither to execute that murder, but it happened as Themistocles slept at the noone day, hee heard a voice crying out vnto him, O Themistocles effuge leonum caput ne ipse in leonem incurras : that is to say, Plutarch. O Themistocles get thee out of the Lyons head, least thou fall into the Lyons teeth: whereupon he arose and saued his life. The face of a Lyon is not round as some haue imagined, and therefore compared it vnto the Sunne, because in the compasse thereof the haires stand out eminent like Sunne-beames, but rather it is square figured like as his forehead, which Aristotle saith, you may chuse whether you will cal it a forehead or Epipedon frontis: that is, the superficies of a fore∣head: for like a cloud it seemeth to hange ouer his eies and nose, and therefore the Ger∣mans call a man that looketh with such a countinance, Niblen of Nubilare, to be cloudy, and it betokeneth either anger or sorrow: also it is called Scithicus aspectus, because the Sci∣thians were alwaies wont to looke as though they were ready to fight. The eies of a Lyon are red, fiery, and hollow, not very round nor long, looking for the most part awry; wher∣fore the Poets stile the Lionesse Tocua leaena. The pupils or aples of the eie shine exceeding¦ly, in somuch as beholding of them, a man would thinke hee looked vpon fire. His vpper eie-lid is exceeding great, his Nose thick, and his vpper chap doth not hang ouer the neather, but meete it iust: his mouth very great, gaping wide, his lippes thinne, so that the vpper partes fall in the neather, which is a token of his fortitude: his teeth like a Wolues and a Dogges, like sawes, losing or changing onely his canine teeth, the tongue like a Cats or leopards, as sharpe as a file, wearing through the skinne of a man by licking; his Necke very stiffe because it consisteth but of one bone without ioynts, like as in a Wolfe and an Hyaena, the flesh is so hard as if it were all a sinnew: Ther are no knucles or turning ioyntes in it called Spondyli, and therefore he cannot looke backward. The greatnesse and roughnesse of his Necke betokeneth a magnanimious and liberall mind, nature hath giuen a short Necke vnto the Lyon, as vnto Beares and Tygers, be∣cause they haue no need to put it downe to the earth to feede like an Oxe, but to lift it vp to catch their prey. His shoulders and brestes are very stronge, as also the forepart of his body, but the members of the hinder part do degenerate. For as Pliny saith, Leoni vis sum∣ma in pectore, the chiefest force of a Lion is in his breast. The part about his throate-bole is loose and soft, and his Metaphrenon or part of his backe against his hart (so called) betwixt his shoulder-blades, is very broad. The backbone and ribs are very strong, his ventricle narrow, and not much larger then his maw. He is most subiect to wounds in his flancke, because that part is weakest, in all other parts of his body he can endure many blowes. About his loines and hip-bone he hath but litle flesh. The lionesse hath two vdders in the midest of her belley, not because she bringeth forth but two at a time, (for somtimes she bringeth more, but because she aboundeth in Milke, and her meat which she getteth sel∣dome,) and is for the most parte fleshe turneth all into milke. The taile of a Lyon is very long, which they shake oftentimes, and by beating their sides therewith, they pro∣uoke themselues to fight. The Graecians call it Alcaea : and Alciatus maketh this excellent embleme thereof vpon wrath. Alcaum veteres candam dixere Leonis Qua stimulante iras concipit ille graues. Lutea quam surgit bilis crudescit & atro, Felle dolor, furias excitat indomitas. The neather parte of his taile is full of haires and gristles, and some are of opinion, that there is therein a little sting where withall the Lyon pricketh it selfe; but of this more after∣wards. The bones of Lyons haue no marrow in them, or else it is so small, that it seemeth no∣thing: therefore they are the more strong, solide, and greater, then anye other beast of their stature, and the Males haue euer more harder bones then the female, Aelianus Aristotle for by striking them together you may beget fire, as by the percussion of Flints; and the like may be said of other beasts that liue vpon flesh, yet are some of the bones hollow. The legs of a Lion are very strong and full of Nerues, and instead of an anckle-bone it hath a crooked thing in his pasterne, such as children vse to make for sport, and so also hath the Lynx. His forefeet haue fiue distinct toes or clawes on each foot, and the hinderfeet but foure. pliny. cardanus His clawes are crooked, and exceeding hard, and this seemeth a little miracle in nature, that leodards, Tygers, Panthers, and lions, do hid their clawes within their skin when they goe or run, that so they might not be dusted, and neuer pull them forth except when they are to take or deuoure their prey: also when they are hunted, Solinus. with their tailes they couer their footsteps with earth, that so they may not be bewrayed. The Epithets of this beast are many, whereby the authors haue expressed their seueral na∣tures, such are these, the curst kind of lyons, ful of stomacke, sharp, bold, greedy, blunket, flesh-eater, Caspian, Claeonian, the lord and King of the beastes, and woodes, fierce, wild, hairy, yellowe, strong, fretting, teeth-gnashing, Naemean, thundering, raging, Getulian, rough, lowring, or wry-faced, Impacient, quicke, vntamed, free, and mad, according to this saying of the Poet; Fertur prometheus insani Leonis Vim stomacho opposuisse nostro. Foras the Eagle is fained to feede vpon the heart of Prometheus, so also is the lion the ru∣ler of the heart of man, according to the Astrologians. And from hence it commeth that a man is said to beare a stomacke when he is angry, and that he should bee more subiect to anger when he is hungry, then when he is full of meat. These also are the Epethets of lions, wrathfull, maned, Libian, deadly, stout, great, Masilian, Mauritanian, Parthian, Phrygian, Molorchaean, Carthaginian, preying, rauening, The epithets of Lyons. stubborne, snatching, wrinkled, cruell, bloody, terrible, swelling, vast, violent, Marmaruan. These also are the Epethites of the Lionesse, Affrican, bold, stony-harted, vengible▪ caue∣lodging, fierce, yellowe, Getulian, Hercanian, vegentle, Libian, cruell, frowning, and ter∣rible. By all which the nature of this Beast, and seuerall properties thereof, are compendi∣ously expressed in one word. The voice of the lion is called Rugitus, The voice of Lyons. that is roaring, or bel∣lowing; according to this verse of the Poet. Tigrides indomita rancant rugiunt{que} leones. And therefore commeth Rugitus leonis the roaring of the Lyon. It is called also Gemitus, and Fremitus as Virgill, fremit leo ore cruento. And againe: Hinc exaudiret gemitus irae{que} leonum Vincla recusantum, & sera sub nocte rudentum. And when the young lions haue gotten a prey, in token whereof they roare like the blea∣ting of a calfe, thereby calling their elders to participate with them. The places of their aboad are in the mountaines, according to this saying: Leo cacumina montium amat. Their sight and their smelling are most excellent, for they sleep with their eies open, and because of the brighnesse of their eyes, they canot endure the light of fire; for fire & fire cannot agree: also their smelling (for which cause they are called Odorati ) is very emi∣nent, for if the lionesse haue committed adultry with the leopard, the male discouereth it by the sence of his Nose, and for this cause also they are tamed in Tartaria, and are vsed for hunting Boares, Pa. Ʋenetus. Beares, Harts, Roe-buckes, wilde Asses, as also for wilde and vtlan∣dish Oxe , and they were wont to be carried to hunting two Lyons in a cart together, & either of them had a litle dog following them. There is no Beast more vehement then a shee or Female-lyon, for which cause Semi∣ramis the Babilonian tyrannesse, Aelianus esteemed not the slaughter of a Male Lion or a Libbard, but hauing gotten a Lyonesse, The estimati¦on o a Lyo∣nes, and the uerall rage Lyons. aboue all other she reioyced therein. A Lyon while hee eateth is most fierce and also when he is hungry, but when he is satisfied and filled, hee layeth aside that sauage quality, and sheweth himselfe of a more meeke and gentle nature, so that it is lesse danger to meete with him filled then hungry, for he neuer deuoureth any till famine constraineth him. Aristotle I haue heard a story of an Englishman in Barbary which turned Moore, and liued in the Kings Court, on a day it was said in his presence that there was a Lion within a little space of the Court, and the place was named where it lodged. The Englishman being more then halfe drunke, offered to goe and kill the lyon hand to hand, and therewithall armed himselfe with a Mvsket, Sword and Dagger, and other complements, and hee had also a∣bout him a long Knife; so forth went this renegate English Moore, more like a mad man then an aduised Champion to kill this Lion, and when he came to it, he found it a sleep, so that with no peril he might haue killed her with his Musket before she saw him: but he like a foole-hardy-fellow, thought it as little honour; to kill a lyon sleeping, as a stout champi∣on doth to strike his enemy behind the backe. Therefore with his Musket top he smote the lyon to awake it, wherat the beast sudden∣ly mounted vp, and without any thankes or warning, set his forefeet on this Squires brest, and with the force of her body ouerthrew the Champion, and so stood vppon him, kee∣ping him down, holding her grim face and bloody teeth ouer his face and eies; a sight no doubt that made him wish himselfe a thousand miles from her, because to all likelihood they should bee the grinders of his flesh and bones, and his first executioner to send his cursed soule to the Deuill for denying Iesus Christ his sauiour. Yet it fell out otherwise, for the lyon hauing beene lately filled with some liberall prey did not presently fall to eate him, but stood vpon him for her owne safegard, and ment so to stand till shee was an hungry; during which time, the poore wretch had liberty to gather his wits together, and so at the last, seeing he could haue no benefit by his Musket, Sword, or Dagger, and perceiuing nothing before him but vnauoidable death, thought for the sauing of his credit, that he might not dye in foolish infamy, to doe some exploit vppon the Lion whatsoeuer did betide him; and thereupon seeing the lion did bestride him, standing ouer his vpper partes, his handes being at some liberty, drew out his longe Barbarian knife, and thrust the same twice or thrice into the lions flanke; which the lion endured, neuer hurting the man, but supposing the woundes came some other way, and would not forsake her booty to looke about for the meanes whereby shee was harmed. At last, finding her selfe sicke, her bowels being cut asunder within her (for in all hot bodies wounds work presently) she departed away from the man about some two yards distance and there lay downe and dyed; The wretch being thus deliuered from the iawes of death, you must thinke made no small brags thereof in the court, notwithstanding, he was more beholding to the good nature of the lion, which doth not kill to eate except he be hungry, then to his owne wit, strength, or vallour. The Male Lyon doeth not feede with the Female, but either of them a-part, by themselues. Their foode and eating. They eate rawe flesh, for which cause the Graecians call them Omesteres, Omoboroi, and Omophagoi : the younge ones themselues cannot longe bee fed with Milke, Albertus because they are whot and dry; being at libertie they neuer want meate, and yet they eate nothing but that which they take in hunting, and they hunt not but once a day at the most, Auicen. and eate euery second day: whatsoeuer they leaue of their meate, they returne not to it againe to eate it afterwardes, whereof some assigned the cause to bee in the meate, because they can endure nothing which is vnsweete, stale, or stinking; but in my opinion they do it throgh the pride of their naturs, resembling in al things a Princely ma∣iesty, and therefore scorne to haue one dish twice presented to their own table. But tame Lyons being constrained through hunger, will eate dead bodies, and also cakes made of meale and hony, as may appeare by that tame Lyon which came to Appollonius, and was sayd to haue the soule in it of Amasis King of Egypt, which story is related by Philostratus in this manner. There was (saith he) a certaine man which in a leame led vp and downe a tame Lyon like a Dogge, whethersoeuer he would, and the Lyon was not onely gentle to his leader, but to all other persons that met him; by which meanes the man got much gaines, and there∣fore visited many Regions and Citties, not sparing to enter into the temples, at the time of sacrifising, because he had neuer shed blood but was cleare from slaughter, neither lick∣ed vp the blood of the beastes, nor once touched the flesh cut in pieces for the holy altar, but did eate vpon Cakes made with meale and hony; also bread, Gourds, and sod flesh, and now and then at customary times did drinke wine. As Appollonius satte in a Temple, hee came vnto him in more humble manner, lying downe at his feete, and looking vp into his face, then euer he did to any, as if he had some speciall supplycation vnto him, and the people thought he did it for hope of some reward, at the commaund and for the gaine of his maister: At last Appolonius looked vppon the lyon, and tolde the people that the lyon did entreat him to signifie vnto them what hee was, and wherewithall hee was possessed; namely, that he had in him the soule of a man, that is to say, of Amasis a King of Egypt, who raigned in the prouince of Sai. At which words, the Lyon sighed deepely, and mour∣ned forth a lamentable roaring, and gnashing his teeth together, and crying with aboundance of teares; whereat Appollonius stroked the beast, and made much of him, telling the peo∣ple, that his opinion was, forasmuch as the soul of a K. had entred into such a kingly beast, he iudged it altogether vnfit that the beast should go about, and beg his liuing, and ther∣fore they should do well to send him to Leontopolis, there to be nourished in the Temple. The Egyptians agreed thereunto, and made sacrifice to Amasis, adorning the beast with Chaines, Bracelets, and branches, so sending him to the inner Egypt, the priestes sing∣ing before him all the way, their idolatrous, Hymnes, & Anthems ; but of the transfigurati∣on of men into Lions, we shall say more afterwardes, onely this story I rehearsed in this place to shew the food of tame and enclosed lyons. The substance of such transfigurations, I hold to be either poetical or else diabolicall. The foode therefore of lyons is most commonly of meeke and gentle beasts, for they will not eate Wolues or Beares, or such beastes as liue vpon rauening, because they begette in them melancholy: they eate their meate very greedily, and deuoure many thinges whole without chewing, but then they fast afterwards two or three daies together, neuer eating vntill the former be digested; but when they fast, that day they drink, and the next day they eate, for they seldome eate and drinke both in one day: Aelianus. philes and if any sticke in his stomacke which he cannot digest because it is ouercharged, then doth he thrust down his Nailes into his throate, and by straining his stomacke pulleth it out again: The selfe same thing he doth when he is hunted vpon a full belly: and also it must not be forgotten that althought he come not twice to one carcasse, yet hauing eaten his belly full, at his depar∣ture by a wilfull breathing vpon the residue, he so corrupteth it, Solinus. that neuer after any beast will tast thereof: for so great is the poyson of his breath, that it putrifieth the flesh, and also in his owne body after it is sodainely rypped vppe, the intrals stinke abhominably. Pliny Aristotle The reasons whereof I take to be their great voracitie which cannot but corrupt in their stomacke, and also the seldome emptying of their belly, for they vtter their excrements not aboue once in three daies, and then also it is exceeding dry like a dogges stinking ab∣hominably, and sending forth much winde: and because their vrine smelleth strongly, which also they render like a dogge holding vp one of their legges: They neuer make water, but first of all they smell to the tree, I meane the male Lion: They fall vpon some creatures for desire of meate, and especially when they are old, and not able to hunt they goe to townes and villages, to the stables of Oxen, and foldes of sheepe, and sometimes to men and deuour them, wherefore they neuer eate hearbes but when they are sicke. Polybius affirmeth that he saw them besiege and compasse about many Citties of Af∣fricke, and therefore the people tooke and hanged them vp vpon crosses and gallowses by the high waies to the terror of others. Wherefore as they excell in strength and courage, so also they doe in crueltie, The crueltie of Lions. Leo Afer Philes Herodotus. deuouring both men and beastes, setting vpon troupes of horsemen, depopulating the flockes, and heards of cattell, carrying some aliue to their yoonge ones, killing fiue or sixe at one time, and whatsoeuer they lay holde on, they carry it away in their mouth, although it be as bigge as a Camell: for they loue Camels flesh exceedingly. And therefore the Lions that set vpon the Camels of Xerxes, neither medled with the men, The hatred of Lyons and their seuerall enemies. Oxen, nor victuales, but onely the Camels: so that it seemeth no meate is so accep∣table vnto them. They hate aboue measure the wilde Asses, and hunt and kill them, accor∣ding to the saying of the wise man. Leonum venatio onager the wilde Asse is the game of Lions, Ecclus 13. They hate also the Thoes, and fight with them for their meate, be∣cause both of them liue vpon flesh, of whom Gratius writeth, Thoes commisses (clarissima fama) leones Et subiere asto, & paruis domuere lacertis. They eate also Apes, but more for Phisicke then for nourishment: they set vpon Oxen, vsing their owne strength very prudently, for when they come to a stall or heard, they terrifie all, Aelianus that they may take one. They eate also yonge Elephants as we haue shewed before in the storie of Elephants; and so terrible is the roaring of the lyon, that he ter∣rifieth all other beastes, but being at his prey, it is said he maketh a circle with his taile, either in the snowe, or in the dust, and that all beastes included within the compasse of that circle, when they come into it presently know it, & dare not for their liues passe ouer it, (beleeue this who that list.) It is also said, Ambrosius that when the beastes doe heare his voice, all of them doe keepe their standing and dare not stirre a foote, which assertion wanteth not good reason, for by ter∣rour and dread they stand amazed. And the writer of the Glosse vpon the Prophet Amos, vpon these words of the Prophet, Nunquid rugiet leo in saltu, nisi habuerit praedam : Will the lion roare, except he haue a pray? Leo (saith he) Tum famem patitur, si videt praedam dat rugitum quo audito ferae stant fixo gradu stupefactae : that is to say, the lion when he is hungry and seeth his prey roareth, and then all the wilde beastes stand still amazed. The drinke of Lions. They drinke but little, and also seldome as we haue said alreadie, and therefore Cyrus praising good souldiers in Xenophon, vseth these words: Vos famem habetis pro obsonio, & hydroposian de raon toon Leontoon pherete, that is to say, hunger is your shambles, and you are more patient of thirst then lions, The terrours of Lions and means wher∣by they pe∣rish. although you drinke water: Notwithstanding this great valliancie of lions yet haue they their terrors, enemies, and calamities, not only by men, but also by beasts, ouer whom they claime a soueraigntie. We haue shewed already in the storie of dogges, that the great dogs in India and Hircania doe kill lyons, and for∣sake other beastes to combat with them. There is a Tigre also called Lauzani which in many places is twice as bigge as a lion, that killeth them, and despiseth the huge quantity of Elephants. Martiall also writeth, that he saw a tame Tiger deuoure a wilde lion. A serpent or snake doth easily kill a lion, whereof Ambrosius writeth very elegantly. Eximia leonis pulchritudo per comantes ceruicis toros excutitur, cum subito a serpente os pec∣tore tenus attollitur, itaque Coluber ceruū fugit sed leonē interficit. The splendant beautie of a lion in his long curled mane is quickly abated and allayed when the Serpent doth but lift vp his head to his brest; for such is the ordinance of God that the snake which run∣neth from a fearefull Hart, should without all feare kill a couragious lyon: and the writer of Saint Marcellus life, Alla O men dracon▪ &c. How much more will he feare a great Dra∣gon, against whom he hath not power to lift vp his taile: and Aristotle writeth that the ly∣on is afraid of the Swine, and Rasis affirmeth as much of the Mouse. Plinius Ambrose The Cocke also both seene and heard for his voice and combe, is a terror to the lion and Basiliske, and the lyon runneth from him when he seeth him, especially from a white cocke and the reason hereof, is because they are both partakers of the Sunnes qualities in a high degree and therefore the greater body feareth the lesser, because there is a more eminent and predominant sunny propertie in the Cocke, then in the Lion. Animalia so∣laria. Lucretius describeth this terrour notably, affirming that in the morning when the Cocke croweth the Lions betake themselues to flight, because there are certaine seedes in the body of Cockes, which when they are sent and appeare to the eyes of Lions, they vexe their pupils and apples, and make them against nature become gentle and quiet, the verses are these: Quinetiam gallum nocte explaudentibus alis Auroram clara consuetam voce vocare Quem nequeunt rapidi contra constare leones In{que} tueri: ita continuo meminere fugari Nimirum quia sunt gallorum in corpore quaed am Semina: quae quum sint oculis immissa leonum Pupillas intersodiunt acrem{que} dolorem, Praebent, vt nequeant contra durare feroces. We haue spoken already of the Leontophonus how she rendreth a vrine which poysoneth the Lion; the noyses of wheeles and chariots doe also terrifie them, according to the say∣ing of Seneca, Leonipauida sunt ad leuissimos strepitus pectora. The high stomacke of a Lyon is afraid of a little strange noice. Anthologius hath an excellent Epigram of one of Cybels Priests, who trauailing in the mountaines by reason of frost, cold, and snow, was driuen into a Lions den, and at night when the Lion returned, he scarred him away by the sound of a bell: The like also shall be afterward declared of Wolues in their story. They are also afraid of fire, Ardentes{que} faces, quas quamuis saeuiat horret ; For as they are inwardly filled with naturall fire (for which cause by the Egyptians they were dedi∣cated to Vulcan ) so are they the more afraide of all outward fire, Aelianus and so suspitious is he of his welfare, that if he tread vpon the rinde or barke of Oke or the leaues of Osyer, he trembleth and standeth amazed: And Democritus affirmeth that there is a certaine herbe growing no where but in Armenia and Cappadocia, which being layed to a Lion, Plinius maketh him to fall presently vpon his backe and lye vpward without stirring, and gaping with the whole breadth of his mouth, the reason whereof ( Pliny saith) is because it cannot be bruised. There is no beast more desirous of copulation then a lionesse, Leo Afer Their lust of copulation. and for this cause the males oftentimes fall forth, for sometimes eight, ten, or twelue males follow one li∣onesse like so many dogges one fault bitch: for indeede their naturall constitution is so hotte, that at all times of the yeare both sexes desire copulation, although Aristotle see∣meth to be against it because they bring forth onely in the spring. The lionesse (as we haue shewed already) committeth adultery by lying with the Lib∣bard, The adultery of lionesses. Pliny Apollonius for which thing she is punished by her male if she wash not her selfe before she come at him, but when she is ready to be deliuered, she flieth to the lodgings of the Lib∣bards, and there among them hideth her yong ones, (which for the most part are males) for if the male Lion find them, he knoweth them and destroyeth them, as a bastard and adulterous issue, and when she goeth to giue them sucke, she faineth as though shee went to hunting. By the copulation of a lionesse and an Hyaena is the Aēthiopian Crocuta brought foorth. Pollux Coelius The Arcadian dogges called Leontomiges were also generated betwixt dogges and Lions: In all her life long she beareth but once, and that but one at a time, as Ae∣sop seemeth to set downe in that fable, where he expresseth that contention betweene the lionesse and the Fox, about the generositie of their yong ones: the Foxe obiecteth to the lionesse, that she bringeth forth but one whelpe at a time, but hee on the contrary begetteth many Cubs, wherein he taketh great delight; vnto whom the lionsse maketh this answere: Parere se quidem vnum sed Leonem : That is to say, shee bringeth foorth indeede but one, yet that one is a Lyon: for one Lyon is better then a thousand Foxes, and true generosity consisteth not in popularitie, or multitude, but in the giftes of the minde ioyned with honorable discent: The lionesses of Syria beare fiue times in their life; at the first time fiue, afterwards but one, and lastly they remaine barren. He∣rodotus speaking of other lions, saith they neuer beare but one, and that only once, where∣of he giueth this reason, that when the whelpe beginneth to stirre in his dams belly, the length of his clawes pearce through her matrix, and so growing greater and greater, by often turning leaueth nothing whole; so that when the time of littering commeth she ca∣steth forth her whelpe and her wombe both together, after which time she can neuer bear more: but I hold this for a fable, because Homer, Pliny, Oppianus, Solinus, Philes, and Aeli∣anus affirme otherwise contrary, and besides experience sheweth the contrary. When Apollonius trauelled from Babilon, by the way they saw a lionesse that was killed by hunters, the beast was of a wonderfull bignesse, such a one as was neuer seene: about her was a great cry of the hunters, and of other neighbours which had flocked thither to see the monster, not wondring so much at her quantitie, as that by opening of her belly, they found within her eight whelpes, whereat Appolonius wondring a little, told his com∣panions that they trauailing now into India should be a yeare and eight monthes in their iourney: Philestratus For the one lion signified by his skill, one yeare, and the eight yong ones eight monethes. The truth is, that a lion beareth neuer aboue thrice, that is to say, six at the first, and at the most afterwards, two at a time, and lastly but one, because that one pro∣ueth greater, and fuller of stomacke, then the other before him; wherefore nature hauing in that accomplished her perfection, giueth ouer to bring foorth any more. Within two monthes after the lionesse hath conceaued, the whelpes are perfected in her wombe, and at six monthes are brought foorth blinde, weake, and (some are of opinion) without life, which so doe remaine three daies together, Physiologus vntill by the roaring of the male their father, and by breathing in their face they be quickned, which also he goeth about to establish by reason: but they are not worth the relating. Isidorus on the other side declareth that for three daies and three nights after their littering, they doe nothing but sleepe, and at last are awaked by the roaring of their father: so that it should seeme without controuersie, they are sencelesse for a certaine space after their whelping: At two monthes old they be∣gin to runne and walke. They say also that the fortitude, wrath, and boldnesse of lions, is conspicuous by their heate, the young one containeth much humiditie contriued vnto him by the temprament of his kinde, which afterwards by the drinesse and caliditie of his complectiom groweth viscus and slimie like bird-lime, and through the helpe of the ani∣mall spirits preuaileth especially about his braine, whereby the nerues are so stopped, and the spirits excluded, that all his power is not able to moue him, vntill his parents partly by breathing into his face, and partly by bellowing, driue away from his braine that vis∣cus humour: these are the words of Physiologus whereby he goeth about to establish his opinion: but herein I leaue euery man to his owne iudgement, in the meane season admi∣ring the wonderfull wisedome of God, which hath so ordered the seuerall natures of his creatures, that whereas the little Partrige can runne so soone as it is out of the shell; & the duckling the first day swim in the water with his dam, yet the harmefull lions, Beares, Ty∣gres, and their whelpes are not able to see, stand, or goe, for many monthes; whereby they are exposed to destruction when they are young, which liue vpon destruction when they are olde: so that in infancie, God clotheth the weaker with more honor. There is no creature that loueth her young ones better then the lionesse, for both sheapheards, and hunters, frequenting the mountaines, doe oftentimes see how irefully she fighteth in their defence, receauing the wounds of many darts, & the stroakes of ma∣ny stones, the one opening hir bleeding body, & the other pressing the bloud out of the wounds, standing inuincible neuer yeelding till death, yea death it selfe were nothing vn∣to her, Aelianus Endemus so that her yonge ones might neuer be taken out of her den: for which cause Ho∣mer compareth Aiax to a lionesse, fighting in the defence of the carcasse of Patroclus. It is also reported, that the male will leade abroad the yong ones, but it is not likely, that the lyon which refuseth to accompany his female in hunting will so much abase his noble spi∣rit, as to vndergoe the lionesses duty in leading abroad the yong ones. In Pangius a moun∣taine of Thracia, there was a lionesse which had whelpes in her den, the which den was obserued by a Beare, Gillius the which Beare on a day finding the den vnfortified both by the absence of the Lion and the lionesse, entred into the same and slew the Lions whelpes, af∣terward went away, and fearing a reuenge, for her better securitie against the lions rage, climbed vp into a tree, and there sat, as in a sure castle of defence: at length the lion and lionesse returned both home, and finding their little ones dead in their owne bloud, ac∣cording to naturall affection fell both exceeding sorrowfull, to see them so slaughtered whom they both loued; but smelling out by the foote the murderer, followed with rage vp and downe vntill they came to the tree whereinto the Beare was ascended, and seeing her, looked both of them gastly vpon her, oftentimes assaying to get into the tree, but all in vaine, for nature which adorned them with singular strength and nimblenesse, yet had not endued them with power of climbing, so that the tree hindring them from re∣uenge, gaue vnto them further occasion of mourning, and vnto the Beare to reioyce at her owne crueltie, and deride their sorrow. Then the male forsooke the female, leauing her to watch the tree, and he like a mourn∣full father for the losse of his children, wandred vp and downe the mountaine making great moane and sorrow, till at the last he saw a Carpenter hewing wood, who seeing the lion comming towards him let fall his Axe for feare, but the lion came very louingly towards him, fawning gently vpon his breast with his forefeete, and licking his face with his tongue; which gentlenesse of the lion the man perceauing, he was much astonished, and being more and more embraced, and fawned one by the lion, he followed him, lea∣uing his Axe behind him which he had let fall, which the lion perceauing went backe, and made signes with his foote to the Carpenter that he should take it vp: but the lion perceauing that the man did not vnderstand his signes, hee brought it himselfe in his mouth and deliuered it vnto him, and so led him into his Caue, where his yongue whelps lay all embrewed in their owne bloud, and then led him where the lionesse did watch the Beare, she therefore seeing them both comming, as one that knew her husbands purpose, did signifie vnto the man he should consider of the miserable slaughter of her yongue whelpes, and shewing him by signes, that he should looke vp into the tree where the Beare was, which when the man saw he coniectured that the Beare had done some grei∣uous iniurie vnto them; he therefore, tooke his Axe and hewed downe the tree by the rootes, which being so cut, the Beare tumbled downe headlong, AElianus which the two furious beastes seeing they tore her all to peeces: And afterwards the lion conducted the man vnto the place and worke where he first met him, and there left him, without doing the least violence or harme vnto him. Neither doe the old lions loue their yongue ones in vaine and without thankes or re∣compence, for in their old age they require it againe, The recom∣pence of yong Lions to the old. Tzetzes then do the yongue ones both de∣fend them from the annoyances of enemies and also maintaine and feede them by their owne labour: for they take them foorth to hunting, and when as their decrepite and withered estate is not able to follow the game, the yonger pursueth and taketh it for him: hauing obtained it, roareth mightily like the voice of some warning peece; to signifie vn∣to his elder that he should come on to dinner, and if he delay, hee goeth to seeke him where he left him, or else carrieth the prey vnto him: at the sight whereof in gratulation of naturall kindnesse and also for ioy of good successe, the olde one first licketh and kis∣seth the yonger, and afterward enioy the bootie in common▪ betwixt them. Admirable is the disposition of lions, both in their courage, societie, and loue, Aristotle Albertus The loue of lions to their benefactors. for they loue their nourishers and other men with whom they are conuersant: they are nei∣ther fraudulent nor suspitious, they neuer looke awry or squinte, and by their good wils they would neuer be looked vpon. Their clemencie in that fierce and angry nature is also worthy commendation, The nature of their re∣uenge. Pliny Solinus and to be wondered at in such beastes, for if one prostrate himselfe vnto them as it were in pe∣tition for his life, they often spare except in extremitie of famine; and likewise they sel∣dome destroy women or children: and if they see women, children, and men togither, they take the men which are strongest and refuse the other as weaklings and vnworthie their honor; and if they fortune to be harmed by a dart or stone by any man, accor∣ding to the qualitie of the hurt, they frame their reuenge; for if it wound not, they only terrifie the hunter, but if it pinch them further, and draw blood, they increase their pun∣ishment. There is an excellent story of a Souldior in Arabia, who among other his colleagues rode abroad on geldings to see some wilde Lyons: now geldings are so fearefull by na∣ture, that where they conceiue any feare, no wit or force of man is able by spurre and rod to make him to come neare the thing it feareth, but those which are not gelded are more bold and coragious, and are not at all affraid of Lyons, but will fight and combate with them. As they road they saw three Lyons together, one of the souldiours seeing one of them stray and runne away from his fellowes, cast a Dart at him, which fell on the ground neare the Lyons head, whereat the beast stood stil a little, and pawsed, and afterward went forward to his fellowes. At last the Souldior road betwixt him and his fellowes which were gone before, and ran at his head with his spear, but missed it, and fel from his horse to the earth, then the Lyon came vnto him and tooke his head in his mouth, which was armed with a Helmet, and pressing it a little did wound him, but not kill him, taking of him no more reuenge, then might requite the wrong receiued, but not the wrong intended; for generally they hurt no more then they are harmed. There is an obscure Authour that attributeth such mercy and clemency to a Beaste which he calleth Melosus, for he persecuteth with violence and open mouth stout men, and al whom he is able to resist, but yet is affraid of the crying of children. It is probable that he mistaketh it for the Lyon, for besides him, I haue not read of any Beast that spa∣reth young children. Solinus affirmeth that many Captiues hauing bene set at liberty, haue met with Lyons as they returned home, weake, ragged, sicke, and disarmed, safely with∣out receiuing any harme or violence. And in Lybia the people beleeue that they vnderstand the petitions and entreatings of them that speak to them for their liues: for there was a certaine captiue woman comming home againe into Getulia her natiue country through many woods, was set vpon by ma∣ny Lyons, against whom she vsed no other weapon but only threatnings and faire words, falling down on her knees vnto them, beseeching them to spare her life, telling them that she was a stranger, a captiue, a wanderer, a weake, a leane and lost woman, and therefore not worthy to bee deuoured by such couragious and generous beastes as they: at which words they spared her, Pliny. Solinus. which thing she confessed after her safe returne: the name of this woman was called Iuba. Although about this matter there be sundry opinions of men, some making question whether it be true, that the Lyon will spare a prostrate suppliant, making confession vnto him that hee is ouercome; yet the Romans did so generally be∣leeue it, that they caused to be inscribed so much vpon the gates of the great Roman pal∣lace in these two verses; Iratus recolas, Textor. quam nobilis ira leonis In sibi prostratos, se negat esse feram. It is reported also, that if a man and another beast be offered at one time to a lyon to take his choice, Albertus. whether of both he will deuoure, he spareth the man and killeth the other beast. These lions are not onely thus naturally affected, but are enforced thereunto by chance and accidentall harmes. As may appeare by these examples following, Mentor the Syra∣cusan as he trauailed in Syria met with a Lyon, that at his first sight fell prostrate vnto him, roling himselfe vpon the earth like some distressed creature, whereat the man was much amazed, and not vnderstanding the meaning of this beast, he indeauored to run away; the beaste still ouertooke him, and met him in the face, licking his footstepes like a flatterer, shewed him his heele, wherein hee did perceiue a certaine swelling, whereat hee tooke a good heart, going vnto the Lyon, tooke him by the legge, and seeing a splint sticking therein, hee pulled it forth, so deliuering the Beast from paine; for the memory of this fact, the picture of the man and the Lyon were both pictured together in Syracusis, vn∣till Plynies time, as hee reporteth. The like story is reported of Elpis the Samian, who comming into Affricke by shippe, and there goyng a shore, had not walked very far on the land, but he met with a gaping lyon, at which being greatly amazed, he clim∣bed vp into a tree, forasmuch as there was no hope of any other flight, and prayed vnto Bacchus (who in that Countrey is esteemed as chiefe of the Gods) to defend him, as hee thoght from the iaws of death: but the lion seeing him to climb into the tree stood stil, and layed himselfe downe at the roote thereof, desiring him in a manner, by his heauy roa∣ring to take pitty vppon him, gaping with his mouth and shewing him a bone sticking in his teeth, which through greedinesse he swallowed, which did so paine him, that he could eate nothing: at the last the man perceiuing his mind, (moued by a miracle) layed aside all feare, and came downe to the dumbe-speaking distressed Lyon, and eased him of that misery: which being performed he not onely shewed himselfe thankefull for the present time, but like the best natured honest man, neuer forsooke shore, Pliny. but once a day came to shew himself to the man his helper, during the time that they abode in those quarters; & therefore Elpis did afterward dedicate a temple vnto Bacchus in remembrance thereof. And this seemeth to me most woonderfull, that Lyons should know the vertue of mens curing hands aboue other creatures, & also come vnto them against nature & kind, but so much is the force of euil & pain, that it altereth al courses of sauage minds and creatures. When Androcles a seruant ranne away from a Senator of Rome, Aelianus Gellius. because he had com∣mitted some offence, (but what his offence was I know not) and came into Affrica, leauing the Citties and places inhabited to come into a desert region: Afterward when Androcles had obtained a maister being Consull of that prouince of Affrica, A notable story of a Ly¦on. hee was compelled by daily stripes to run away, that his sides might bee free from the blowes of his maister, and went into the solitary places of the fieldes, and the sandes of the wildernesse: and if hee should happen to stand in neede of meat, he did purpose to end his life by some meanes or other: and there hee was so scortched with the heate of the sunne, that at last finding out a caue, he did couer himselfe from the heate of it therein: and this caue was a lyons den. But after that the lyon had returned from hunting, (being very much pained by rea∣son of a Thorne which was fastened in the bottom of his foote) vttered forth such great lamentation and pittifull roaringes, by reason of his wound, as that it should seeme, hee did want some body to make his moane vnto for remedy; at last comming to his caue, and finding a young man hid therein, hee gently looked vpon him, and began as it were to flatter him, and offered him his foote, and did as well as hee could pray him to pull out the peece of splint which was there fastened. But the man at the first was very sore afraid of him, and made no other reckoning but of death: but after that he saw such a huge sauage beast so meeke and gentle, beganne to thinke with himselfe, that surely there was some sore on the bottom of the foote of the beast, because he lifted vp his foote so vnto him, and then taking courage vnto him, Gellius. lifted vppe the lyons foot, and found in the bottom of it a great peece of splint, which he pluck∣ed forth, and so by that meanes eased the lyon of her paine, and pressed forth the matter which was in the wound, and did very curiously without any great feare throughly dry it, and wipe away the bloud: the lyon being eased of his paine, laide himselfe downe to rest, putting his foot into the hands of Androcles. With the which cure the lion being very wel pleased, because he handled him so curti∣ously and friendly, not onely gaue him for a recompence his life, but also went daily a∣broad to forrage and brought home the fattest of his prey. Androcles whom all this while (euen for the space of three yeares) he kept familiarly, without any note of cruelty or e∣uill nature in his den, and there the man and the beast liued mutually at one commons, the man roasting his meate in the whot sun, and the lyon eating his part raw, according to kinde. When he had thus liued by the space of three yeares, and grew weary of such a habitation, life, and society, he bethought himselfe of some meanes to depart; and ther∣fore on a day when the lion was gone abroad to hunting, the man tooke his iourny away from that hospitality, and after he had trauailed three daies (wandering vp and down) he was apprehended by the legionary souldiers: to whom he told his long life and habitati∣on with the lyon, and how he ranne away from his maister a senator of Rome, which when they vnderstood, they also sent him home againe to Rome to the Senator. And being receiued by his maister, he was guilty of so great and foule faults, that he was condemned to death, and the manner of his death was, to be torne in peeces of Wilde beasts. Now there were at Rome in those daies many great, fearefull, cruell, and rauening beastes, and among them many Lyons, it fortuned also that shortly after the taking of the man, the aforesaid Libyan Lyon with whom hee liued long, seeking abroade for his companion and man-friend, was taken and brought to Rome, and there put among the residue, who was the most fierce, grim, fearefull, and Sauage, aboue all other in the com∣pany, and the eies of men were more fastened vppon him then all other beside. When Androcles was brought forth to his execution, and cast in among these Sauage beastes, this Lyon at the first sight looking stedfastly vppon him, stood still a little, and then came toward him softly, and gently, smelling to him like a Dogge, and wagging his taile: the poore exanimat and forlorne man not looking for any thing but present death, trembled and was scarce able to stand vpright in the presence of such a beast; not once thinking vp∣on the Lyon that had nourished him so long, but the Beast Accepti beneficij memore, mind∣full of former friendship, licked gently his hands and legs, and so went round about him touching his body, and so the man began to know him, and both of them to congratulate each other in that their imprisoned occurrence; and to signifie to all the beholders their former acquaintaunce and conuersation, the man by stroking and kissing the Lyon, and the Lyon by falling downe prostrate at the mans feet. In the meane time a Pardall came with open mouth to deuoure the man, but the lion rose vp against hir and defended his old friend, and she being instant, the lion tore her in pieces to the great admiration of the be∣holders, Gillius. as it could not otherwise chuse. Then Caesar which had caused those spectacles, sent for the man, and asked him the cause of that so rare and prodigious an euent, who in∣continently told him the story before expressed. The rumor whereof was quickly spred a∣broad among the people, and tables of writing were made of the whole matter, and final∣ly all men agreed that it was fit that both the man and the lion should be pardoned and re∣stored to liberty: Appion. and afterward (saith Appion ) all the people (and beholders of that come∣dy) were sutors to the Senat for the accomplishment thereof, and so the man was pardo∣ned, and the lion was giuen vnto him for a reward or fuffrage, who led him vp and downe the streets in a leame or slip, Androcles receiuing mony, and the lion adorned with flowers and garlands, and all men that saw or met them, said: Hic est leo hospes hominis, hic est homo medicus leonis, Here goeth the lion which was this mans Host, and here is the man which was this lions Phisitian. Seneca also in his book de beneficijs, out of Gellius writeth so much of another lion: and indeed there is no man or other beast more fixed and constant in their loue and frendship, A story of the iustice of Lyons. or more ready to reuenge the breach of amity and kindnesse, then is a lion; as appeareth by this story of Eudemus, who writeth of a certaine young man, that he nourish∣ed together many years, a dog, a beare, and a lyon, who liued in perfect peace and con∣cord without breach, snarling, or apparance of anger. On a day as the bear and dog play∣ed together and biting one another gently, it happened that the dog fastened his teeth (in sport) deeper then the beare could digest, and therefore presently he fell vpon him, and with his clawes tore out the soft part of his belly, whereof he presently dryed: The lyon sitting by, and seeing this cruelty and breach of loue, amity, and concord, among them that had so long liued together, fell to be inflamed to reuenge that perfidy; and like a true king of beasts, Aelianus. measured the same measure to the beare as he had done to the dog, and ser∣ued him with the same sauce, tearing him instantly in pieces. There is also in the life of S. Ierome, a story of a lion, that was cured by him, as you haue read before the lyon was by Elpis, and that the beast in gratitutde of that good turne, did euer afterward follow the asse which brough him home his carriage and prouision through the woods; Till at last the li∣on being a sleepe, the Asse was stollen away, for sorrow wherof the lion put himselfe in the Asses stead, T xtor. to beare burthens as he did within short time after he found out the Asse in the theeus stable, and broght him home again: but I am of Erasmus mind concerning this story, Diodorus. that the Author thereof tooke vpon him to write wonders and not truth. The Kings of Egypt and Syria did keepe tame lions, to accompany them into their wars, which were led about their owne bodies for their guard and costody, The clemen¦cy of Lyons in sparing men. against all perill and inuasion. It is also very pertinent to this place, to expresse the clemency of these beastes towardes the martyrs and seruants of Iesus Christ, both men and women, that so we may obserue the performance and accomplishment of that prophesie Psal. 91. That they should walke vpon the Aspe and the Cockatrice, and sofely tread vpon the lion and the Dragon ; This we are not to attribute to the nature of lions, but rather to the ouerruling hand of ours and their Creator who in remembrance of his own promise, and aduancement of his own glory, sto∣peth the mouth of lions, and restraineth all violence both of liuing creatures and ele∣ments, yet I wil not impose any necessity of beleeuing these stories vpon the reader, Textor. for I my selfe report them not for trueth, but because they are written. When S. Anthony went about to make a graue for the interring of the carkasse of Paule the first Anachorite, and wanted a shouell or spade to turne vp the earth, there came two lions, and with their clawes opened the earth so wide and deepe, that they performed therein the office of a good graue-maker. The prophet Daniell was cast into the lions, to whom (according to the Babilonian story) was giuen for their diet euery day, two condemned men, and two sheep, and yet by power of the almighty whom bee serued, the Angell of the Lord came down and stopt the Lyons mouths, so that in extremity of hunger, they neuer so much as made force as him, but sat quietly at his feet like so many little dogs; by which meanes he escaped all peril and torments of death. Eleutherius being cast to the lions at the com∣maund of Adrian the Emperor, and Prisca a noble Vergin, at the commaund of Claudius Caesar, both of them in their seuerall times, tamed the vntamed beastes and escaped death. Macarius being in the wildernesse or Mountains, it fortuned that a Lionesse had a den neer vnto his cell, wherein she had long nourished blind whelps, to whom the holy man (as it is reported) gaue the vse of their eie and sight; the Lionesse requited the same with such gra∣tification as lay in her power, for she brought him very many sheepe-skins to cloth & co∣uer him. Primus, and Foelicianus, Thracus, Vitus, Modestus, and Crescentia, all martyrs, be∣ing cast vnto lions, receiued no harme by them at all, but the beasts lay down at their feet and became tame, gentle, and meeke, not like themselues, but rather like Doues. When a beare and a lion fell vpon Tecla the vergin, a Martyr, a Lionesse came and fought eagar∣ly in her defence against them both. When Martina the Daughter of a Consull could not be terrified or drawen from the Christian faith by any imprisonment, chaines or stripes, nor allued by any faire words to sacrifice to Apollo, there was a lion brought forth to her, at the commaundement of Alexander the Emperor, to destroy her; who assoone as hee saw her, hee lay downe at her feet wagging his taile, and fawning in a louing and fearefull manner, as if he had bin more in loue with her presence, then desirous to lift vp one of his haires against her. The like may be said of Daria a virgin in the daies of Numerian the Em∣peror, who was defended by a Lionesse, but I spare to blot much paper with the recital of those things (which if they be true) yet the Authors purpose in their allegatiō is most pro∣phain, vnlawful and wicked, because he thereby goeth about to establish miracles in saints, which are long agone ceased in the church of God. Some Martyrs also haue beene deuoured by lyons, as Ignatius Bishop of Antioch, Sa∣tyrus and Perpetua, he vnder Traian the Emperor, and they vnder Valerian and Galienus. Men deuou∣red by Ly∣ons. In holy scripture there is mention made of many men killed by lions. First of all it is me∣morable of a prophet 1 King 13. that was sent by the almighty vnto Ieroboam, to cry out a∣gainst the alter at Bethell, and him that erected that altar, with charge, that he should nei∣ther eate nor drinke in that place. Afterward an old prophet which dwelt in that place hearing thereof, came vnto the Prophet, and told him that God had commaunded him to goe after him, and fetch him backe againe to his house to eate and drinke; wherewithal being deceiued, he came back with him contrary to the commaundement of the lord giuen to himselfe: whereupon as they sat at meate, the prophet that beguiled him, had a charge from God to prophesie a∣gainst him, and so he did: afterward as he went homeward a lion met him and killed him, and stood by the corps, and his Asse not eating of them till the old prophet came and took him away to bury him. In the twentieth chap. of the same book of Kings, ther is another story of a prophet, which as hee went by the way hee met with a man, and bade in the name of the lord to wound and smite him, but he would not, preferring pittie before the seruice of the Lord: well (said the Prophet vnto him) seeing thou refusest to obey the voice of the Lord, Behold as soone as thou art departed, a lyon shall meete thee and destroy thee: and so it came to passe; for being out of the presence of the Prophet, a lion met him and tore him in peeces. The idolotrous people that were placed at Ierusalem by the King of Babel were de∣stroyed by lions, and vnto these examples of God his iudgements, I will adde other out of humane stories. Paphages a King of Ambracia, meeting a lionesse leading her whelpes, was suddenly set vpon by her and torne in peeces, vpon whom Ouid made these verses: Foeta tibi occurrat patrio popularis in aruo, Sit{que} paphageae causa leaena necis. Hyas the brother of Hyades, was also slaine by a lionesse. The people called Ampraciota in Affrique, Aelianus doe most religiously worship a lionesse, because a notable tyrant which did oppresse them was slaine by such an one. There is a mountaine neere the riuer Indus (called Litaeus ) of a shepheard so named, Plutarch which in that mountaine did most superstiti∣ously worshippe the Moone and contemned all other Gods, his sacrifices were perfor∣med in the night season; at length (saith the Author) the Gods being angry with him, sent vnto him a couple of lions who tore him in peeces, leauing no monument behind but the name of the mountaine for the accident of his cruell death. The inhabitants of that mountaine weare in their eares a certain rich stone (called Clitoris ) which is very blacke, and bred no where else but in that place. There is a known storie of the two Babilonian louers, Pyramus and Thisbe, who in the night time had co∣uenanted to meete at a fountaine neere the sepulchre of Ninus, and Thysbe comming thither first, as she sate by the fountaine, a lionesse being thirstie, came thither to drinke water (after the slaughter of an Oxe:) at the sight whereof, Thysbe ranne away and let fall her mantell, which the lionesse finding tore i in peeces with her bloudy teeth. Afterward came Pyramus, and seeing her mantell all bloody and torne asunder, sus∣pecting that she that loued him, being before him at the appointed place had beene kil∣led by some wilde beast, very inconsiderately drew forth his sword, and thrust the same through his owne body; and being scarce dead, Thysbe came againe, and seeing her lo∣uer lye in that distresse, as one loue, one cause, one affection had drawen them into one place, and there one feare had wrought one of their destructions, she also sacrificed her selfe vpon the point of one and the same sword. There was also in Scythia a cruell tyrant (called Therodomas ) who was wont to cast men to lions to be deuoured of them, and for that cause did nourish priuately many ly∣ons: vnto this crueltie did Ouid allude, saying: Therodomantaeos vt qui sensere leones. And againe: Non tibi Therodomas crudus{que} vocabitur Atreus. Vnto this discourse of the bloud-thirstie crueltie of lyons, you may adde the puissant glory of them, who both in sacred and prophane stories are said to haue destroyed ly∣ons. Men that haue ouer∣come lions. When Sampson went downe to Thimnath, it is said, that a yoong lyon met him roaring to destroy him, but the spirit of the Lord came vpon him, and he tore it in pee∣ces like a Kid; wherein he was a type of Iesus Christ, who in like sort being set vpon by the roaring of the diuell and his members, did with facilitie (through his diuine nature) vtterly ouerthrow the malice of the diuell. Afterward Sampson went downe to the Phi∣listine woman whom he loued, and returning, found that Bees had entred into the lions carcasse and there builded, whereupon he propounded this riddle, A voraci exiunt cibus, & ex forti egressa est dulcedo: Out of the deuourer came meate, and out of the strong came sweetenesse. Benaia the sonne of Iehoiada one of Dauids worthies, did in the Winter time in the snow kill a Lion in a ditch: Dauid himselfe feeding his fathers flocke, slew a Lion and a Beare which had robbed him of a Lambe. It is reported of Perdicas (one of the Captaines of Alexander ) a valiant man, that he went alone into the den of a lionesse, but not finding her therein, tooke away her whelps and brought them foorth to the admiration of all men; for the lionesse both among the Barbarians and Graecians is accounted the strongest and most vnresistable beast. In the Northerne parts of the world (saith Pausanias ) neere the monuments of Alcmea and Hyl∣lus, the sonnes of Hercules, there was a Lyon which slew many people, and at last also Euippus the onely sonne of King Megareus ; whereat the King grew so sorrowfull and an∣grie, thirsting after reuenge, that he promised to the man that could ouercome him his daughter and the succession of his kingdome: There was a noble and valiant yong man called Alcathus, who vndertooke the action and killed the Lion, for which thing he ob∣tained both the wife and the kingdome according to the promise of Negareus, and there∣fore in thankfulnesse of so good fortune, he builded there a famous Temple dedicating it to Diana, Agrotera, and Apollo Agraeus. We haue spoken before of Lysimachus, vnto whom we may adde Polydamas the Sco∣tus an, who in all things hetooke in hand, propounded vnto himselfe the example of Her∣cules, and did kill a Lion of monstrous stature and bignesse, being vnarmed, in the moun∣taine Olympus, as at another time he held a Buls leg so fast in his hand, that while the beast stroue to loose himselfe he left the hoofe of his foote behinde him. When Hercules was a boy or stripling, he slew the Teumessian Lion in Teumessus a mountaine of Becotia, and pulled off his skinne which euer after he wore insteede of a cloke. This Lion is also called a Naemean Lion, yet some are of opinion that the Maemean Lion, was another called also the Moloschaean because hauing killed the sonne of Notorchus, he perswaded Hercules which did sworne with him, to take reuenge in his stead. From whence the Nemaean sacrifices is performed by the Graecians in remembrance of Hercules, and Lucan maketh mention of this Nemaean Lion in this verse: Si saenum premaeres Nemaeum saena leonem. And vpon the den of the lion was a Temple builded and dedicated to Iupiter Nemaeus. Varinus speaking of the Nemaean lion telleth this story thereupon, whereas saith he, the said lion could not be killed with any sword, dart, or other sharpe instrument, Hercules tore him in peeces with his handes without all weapons, and afterward wore his skinne in remembrance of that victorie: It happened on a day, that as he trauailed he met with his friend Telamon who wanted children, of whom he was intreated that he would make sacrifice to Iupiter for him in that weede or garment, and also intreate for a sonne. Her∣cules yeelded, and taking the golden censer in his hand, made the sacrifice and supplicati∣on to Iupiter, that Telamon might haue a sonne, and as he sacrificed, an Eagle flew ouer them, which in Greeke is called Aetos, wherefore when Hercules saw the same, he char∣ged Telamon that his sonne should be called Aetos ; that is, an Eagle: and so he was, but afterward he was called Aiax, and wore continually that Lyons skinne which was giuen him by Hercules : and therefore he could not be wounded: But I take this to be but a fable: rather this was the truth. Aiax was a valiant souldier, and so warily carried himselfe in many battailes, that he neuer receiued wound, but at last he slew himselfe with his owne sword thrusting it thorough his necke; and for this cause it was fabled, that he neuer could be wounded by a vertue, as was imagined conferred on him from Hercules. Ouid hath a wittie fiction of one Phyllius, who fell so deepely in loue with a little boy, that at his pleasure he tooke ma∣ny wilde beasts, birds, and Lions, and tamed them to the delight of his Amasius : at length the infatiable boy required him to doe the like by a Bull, which hee had ouercome, but Phyllius denying that request, the boy presently cast himselfe downe from a rocke, and was afterward turned into a Swanne; by which the Poet declareth, the vnmer∣full regard which wretchlesse and childish mindes beare towardes the greatest labors and deserts of the best men, and that in such society a man is no longer beloued, then he giueth, also the deniall of one small request cannot be endured although a thousand good turnes haue gone before it, wherefore such mindes may well be transfused into Swannes, which forsake their owners and breeders, going and swimming farre from their first and proper habitation. Hauing but mentioned such a story, it is not exorbitant to adde in one worde other fictions of metamorphosing, Men transfi∣gured into Lions accor∣ding to poets and fictions and transfiguring men into Lions, which we promised in the former discource of Amasis & Apollonius when I discoursed of the foode of Lions. And first of all, it is not vnproper to remember the caution of Timaeus the Pythago∣raean who affirmeth, that the mutation of men into beastes is but a fiction brought in for the terrour of wicked men, who seeing they cannot be restrained from vice for the loue of well doing, they may be deterred for the feare of punishment, which is meant by such beastly transmigrations. Olympiodo∣rus. And this thing is thought to be most consonant to the opinion of Plato, for in consi∣deration of the habite and not of the kinde, a good house-keeperr and charitable nou∣rishing man is said to be transmuted into a tree: he which liueth by catching and snatch∣ing, to serue his owne concupiscence into a Kite, he which for loue of military discipline and martiall affaires into a lion, he that was a tyrant and a deuourer of men into a dra∣gon: & Empedortes also said, that if a man depart this naturall life and be transmuted in∣to a bruite beast, it is most happiest for him if his soule goe into a lion: but if he loose his kinde and sences and be transmuted into a plant, then is it best to be metamorpho∣sed into a Laurell or Bay tree. And for these causes we read of Hippo chaunged into a lion, and Atlas into a lionesse, and the like I might say of Proteus, of the Curetes, and others: and generally all the Easterne wise men beleeued the transmigration of spirites from one into another, and insinuated so much to their symmists and disciples, making little or no difference betwixts the natures of men and bruite beasts. Therefore they taught that all their Priests after death were turned into lions, their religious Vestals or women into Hyaenaes, Porphyrius their seruaunts or ministers in the temples about the seruice of their vaine Gods into Crowes and Rauens, the fathers of families into Eagles and Hawkes, but those which serued the Leonticke aulters, meaning Na∣maeasacra instituted for the honour of Hercules, were transformed diuersly: but of all these we haue already expressed our opinion, namely to beleeue and thinke so basely of man∣kinde, created after the image as once to conceiue or entertaine one thought of such pas∣sing of one from another, were most lewd and diabolicall; but to conceaue them as alle∣gories by which the mindes of the wise may be instructed in diuine things, and God his iudgements, as it is poeticall, so is it not against any point of learning or good religion. As that which hath beene already expressed most notably describeth the nature of the lion, The vnder∣standing of Lyons. so that succeedeth hath the same vse for the manifestation of the dignity and honor of this beast. First of all therefore to begin with his vnderstanding, and to shew how neere hee commeth to the nature of man. It is reported by Elianus, that in Lybia they retaine great friendship with men, enioying many things in common with them, and drinking at the same well or fountaine. And if at any time he being deceiued in his hunting, and cannot get to satisfie hun∣ger, then goeth he to the houses of men, and there if he finde the man at home, he will enter in and destroy, except by wit, policie, and strength, he be resisted; but if he finde no man but onely women, they by rayling on him and rebukes driue him away, which thing argueth his vnderstanding of the Lybian tongue; The summe and manner of those speeches and wordes which she vseth to affright and turne them away from entering houses, are these: Art not thou ashamed being a Lyon the King of beastes to come to my poore cottage to begge meate at the handes of a woman? and like a sicke man distressed with the weaknesse of bodie to fall into the handes of a woman, that by her mercy thou mayest attaine those thinges which are requisite for thy owne maintenance and sustentation? yea rather thou shouldest keepe in the mountaines and liue in them, by hunting the Hart and other beasts prouided in nature for the lions foode, and not after the fashion of little base dogges, come and liue in houses to take meate at the hands of men and women. By such like words she enchanteth the mind of the Lyon, so that like a reasonable person ouercome with strong arguments, notwithstanding his owne want, hunger, and extremi∣ty, he casteth his eies to the ground ashamed and aflicted, and departeth away without a∣ny enterprise: Neither ought any iudicious or Wise-man thinke this thing to be incredi∣ble, for we see that Horsses and Dogges which liue among men, and heare their continu∣all voices, do discerne also their termes of threatning, chiding, & rating, and so stand in awe of them; and therefore the Lyons of Libia, whereof many are brought vp like Dogs in houses, with whom the little children play, may well come to the knowledge and vnder∣standing of the Maurysian tongue. It is also said they haue vnderstanding of the partes of men and Women, Leo Afer. and discerne sexes, and are indeed with a naturall modesty, declyning the sight of womens priuy parts. And vnto this may be added the notable story of a Lion in England (declared by Crantzi∣us ) which by euident tokens was able to distinguish betwixt the King, nobles, The anger of Lyons, and the signes thereof. and vulger sort of people. As the eares of Horsses, are a note of their generosity, so is the taile of lyons, when it standeth immoueable, it sheweth that he is pleasant, gentle, meeke, vnmoued, and apt to endure any thing, which falleth out very seldome, for in the sight of men hee is seldome found without rage. In his anger, he first of all beateth the earth with his taile, Adamantiu. Albertus. afterwards his owne sides, and lastly leapeth vpon his prey or aduersary. Some creatures vse to wag their tailes, when they see suddenly those which are of their acquaintance, as Dogges; but lyons and Bulles, do it for anger and wrath. The reason both of one and other, is thus rendered by Aphroditius. The back-bone of such beasts is hollow, and containeth in it marrow, which reacheth to the taile, and therefore there is in the taile a kinde of animall motion, and power. For which cause when the beast seeth one of his acquaintance, hee waggeth his taile by way of salutation for the same reason that men shake hands, for that part is the readiest and nimb∣lest member of his body, but Buls and lions, are constrained to the wagging of their tailes for the same reason that angry men are light fingered, and apt to strike: for when they cannot haue sufficient power to reuenge, they either speake if they be men, or else barke if they be Dogges, or smite their sides with their taile if they be lions; by that meanes vt∣tering the furie of their rage to the ease of nature, which they cannot to the full desire of reuenge. But we haue shewed before that the lion striketh his sides with his taile, for the stirring vp of himselfe against dangerous perils, for which cause Lucan compareth Caesar in his warlike expedition, at Pharsalia against his owne Countrey, before his passage ouer Ru∣bicon, whilest he exhorted his souldiors, to a lyon beating himselfe with his owne taile, in these verses; Inde mora sol it belli, tumidum{que} per amnem, Signa tulit propere: sicut sqallentibus armis, Aestifer ae Lybies, viso leo cominus hoste▪ Subsedit dubius, totam dum colligit iram, Mox vbi se saeuae stimulauit verbere caudae, Erexit{que} iubas, vasto & graue murmur hiatu. Infremuit: tum torta leuis si lancea Mauri. Haereat, aut latum subeant venabula pectus, Per ferrum tanti securus vulneris exit There are many Epigrams, both Greeke, and latine, concerning the rage, force, frend∣ship, and society of lions with other beasts, whereof these are most memorable: the first of a Hare which through sport crept through the mouth of a tame lion, whereof Martiall writeth in this sort, teaching her to fly to the lions teeth against the rage of Dogs, in these verses: Rictibus his tauros, non eripuere magistri, Per quos praeda fugax, ita{que} redit{que} lepus, Quod{que} magis mirum, velotior exit ab hostae. Nec nihil à tanta, nobilitate refert. Tutior in sola, non est cum currit arena. Nec cauiae tanta, conditur ille fide, Si vitare canum morsus, lepus improbe guaeriis Ad quae confugias, or a leonis habes. There is another of the same Poets, about the society of a Rame and a Lyon, wherein he∣wondereth, that so different natures should liue together, both because the Lion forget∣teth his prey in the woods, and also the Ram, the eating of green grasse, and through hun∣ger, both of them constrained to tast of the same dishes, and yet this is no other, then that which was foretold in holy scripture, the lion and the lambe should play togither, the E∣pigram is this; Maessyli leo fama iugi, peicoris{que} martitus, Lanigeri, mirum qui posuere fide, Ipse licet videas, cauea stabulantur in vna, Et pariter socias, carpit vter{que} dapes Nec faetu nemorum gaudent, nec mittibus herbis, Concordem saciat, sed rudis agna famem. For we haue shewed before, that a Lyon in his hunger, will endure nothing, but fearcely falleth vpon euery prey, according to these verses of Mannilius. Quis dubitet, vasti quae sit natura leonis? Quas{que} suo dietet, signo nassentibus artes? Ille nouas semper pugnas, noua bella ferarum, Apparat, & pecorum, viuit spolio, at{que} rapinis. Hoc habet, hoc studium postes, ornare superbos Pellibus, & captas domibus configere predas, At{que} parare metum syluis, & viuere rapto. Concerning the hunting and taking of lions, The hunting and taking of Lyons. the Indian dogs, and some other strong hun∣ters do set vpon Buls, Bores, and Lions, as we haue said before in the History of dogs: but dogs, which are begotten of Tygers, amongst the Indians, and those of Hyrcania, especi∣ally doe this thing, as it is noted by Mantuan concerning the fortitude and courage of a dog, saying: Et truculentus Helor certare leonibus audens. In the prouince of Ginezui which is subiect to the great Cham king of Tartaria, there are very many lions which are very great and cruell: and in that region the dogs are accoun∣ted so bould and stronge, as they will not feare to inuade or set vpon those lions; And it oftentimes commeth to passe, that two dogs and a hunting Archer sitting on horse-back do kill and destroy a lion, for when the Dogs perceiue the lion to bee neare them, they set vpon him with great barking, but especialy when they know themselues backed with the help of a man, they do not cease to bite the lyon in his hinder parts and taile: and although the lion doth oftentimes threaten them with his frouning and terrible countinance, tur∣ning himselfe this way and that way, that he might teare them in pieces, notwithstanding the dogs looking warilie vnto themselues, are not easily hurt by him, especially when the hunting Horse-man following them, doth seeke the best meanes to fasten his Dart in the lion, when hee is bitten of the Dogges, for they are wise enough to consider their owne help. But the Lyon then flyeth away, fearing leaste the barking and howling of the dogs, may bring more company both of men and dogs vnto him. And if he can, he betaketh himselfe rightly vnto some tree, that he may enioy the same for a place of defence for his backe, then turning himselfe, with a scornfull grinning hee fighteth withall his force against the Dogges. Paulus. Ʋenetus. But the Hunter comming nearer vppon his Horsse ceaseth, not to throw Dartes at the lyon vntill he kill him: neither doth the lyon feele the force of the Dartes vntill he bee slaine, the Dogges doe vnto him so great hurte and trouble. If a lion be seene in the time of hunting, being ashamed to turne his backe, he doth a lit∣tle turne away himselfe if be oppressed with a multitude: being remoued from the sight of the Hunters, he doth hastily prepare for flight, thinking that his shame is cleared by concealing himselfe; and therefore knoweth that the woods cannot giue testimony of this feare. He doth want in his flight the leaping which he vseth in pursuing other beastes. He doth craftily dissemble and abolish his footesteps to deceiue the Hunters: Pollux affirmeth that if a Hunter do fight against any wilde Beasts, as a Bore, he must not straddle with his Legges wide abroad, but keepe them together within the compasse of a foote, that hee may keepe his ground stedfast and sure, euen as the manner is in Wrestling: for there are some wild Beasts as Panthers and Lyons, when they are hunted, and are hindred in their course by their Hunters, if they be any thing neare them doe presently leape vppon them. But the stroke which is giuen ought to be directed or leauelled right against the breast, and the hart, for that being once striken is incurable. ( Xenophon saith) in his book concer∣ning Hunting, that Lyons, Leopards, Beares, Pardals, Lynxes, and all other wilde Beasts of this sort which inhabite desert places (without Greece, ) are taken about the Pangaean Mountaine, and the Mountaine called Cyrtus aboue Macedony : some in Olympus, Mysius, and Pindus : some in Mysa aboue Syria, and in other Mountaines which are fit for the bree∣ding and nourishing Beastes of this kind. But they are taken partly in the Mountaines by poyson of Wolfe-bane, for the sharpnesse of the Region (because that can admit no other kind of hunting as by Nets and Dogges) but mingling this with that thing in which euery wilde beast delighteth, the Hunters doe cast it vnto them neare the Waters. There are some also which do discende downe in the night time, who are taken in regard that all the waies by which they should ascend vnto the Mountaines are stopped with Hunts-men, and weapons, neither being so excluded, are they taken without great perill vnto the Hunts-men. There are some also which make pitfals or great ditches in the ground to catch Lyons, in the middest whereof, they leaue a profound stony pillar, vpon which in the night time they tye a Goat, and do hedge the pitfals round about with boughes, least that it might be seen, leauing no entrance into the same. The lyons hearing the voice of the goat in the night, doe come vnto the place and walke round about the hedge, but finding no place where they may enter, they leape ouer and are taken. Oppianus doth describe three man∣ner of waies of hunting Lyons, which also Bellasarius doeth, but he doeth describe them in my mind very vnskilfully. The first of them is rehearsed out of Xenophon, Three waies to take Ly∣ons. we will notwithstanding also adde there∣unto Oppianus : for he doth vary in both of them. The second is made by fire, the third by Whips or scourges. The first manner of way is therefore as Gillius for the most part trans∣lateth out of Oppianus, in this sort. Where the Hunters of Lybia doe obserue the beaten path or way of the Lyon going out of his den vnto the Water, they make a broade and round ditch neare vnto it, in the midest wherof they raise vp a great pillar, vpon this they hang a sucking Lambe, they compasse the Ditch round about with a Wall of stones hea∣ped together, least that when the wilde beast commeth neare hee perceiueth the deceite. The Lambe being fastened vppon the top of the pillar, doth incitate the hunger-staruen hart of the Lyon by his bleating, therefore comming neare, and not being able to stay lon∣ger about the Wall, he doth presently leap ouer and is receiued into the vnlooked for ditch, in which being now included, he vexeth himselfe in all the partes of his body, lif∣ting himselfe vp rather at the lambe then to go forth, and being againe ouerthrowen, he maketh force again. These things Gillius affirmeth. The second. The other manner of hunting by fire, is the deuise of the people which inhabite about the Ryuer Euphrates, who hunt lyons after this manner. The Hunters some vpon stronge Horsses, and some vpon gray Horsses with glasen eies which are more swift, & which dare onely meete lions, when other Horsses dare not abide the sight of lyons: other being on foote do set the Nets. Three of them being placed in the snares remaine to vnderprop the Nets, with staies and stakes: one in the middle, all the rest in both the bendinges or tur∣ninges of the same, so that he which is in the middle can heare both the other at the far∣ther endes: some setting round about in warlike manner, holding pitchy fire-brands in their right hands, and bucklers in their left: for with those they make a very great noyse and clamor, and with shewing their fire-brandes, put the wilde beastes in an incredible feare: Therefore when all the Horse-men being spred abroade inuade the beastes, and and the footemen likewise doe follow with a great noise: the lyons being terrified with the crying out of the hunters, not daring to resist, giue place: and aswell for feare of fire, as of the men they runne into the nets and are taken: like as fishes in the night time, by fire are compelled and driuen into the nets of the fishers. The third. The third manner of hunting is done with lesser labour: that is, foure strong men ar∣med with shields, and fortified all ouer with thonges of leather, and hauing helmets vp∣on their heades, that onely their eyes, noses, and lips may appeare, with the brandishing of their firebrands rustle in vpon the lyon lying in his den: he not bearing this indigna∣tion, with a gaping and open-wide mouth, the lightning, or burning of his eyes being inflamed, breaketh foorth into a great roaring, and with such celeritie rustleth vpon them, as if it were some storme and tempest: they with a firme and constant courage abide that brunt: and in the meane while that he coueteth to catch any of them in his teeth or clawes, another of them, prouoking him behinde doth smite him, and with a loude noise or clamour doth vexe him: then the lyon in hast leauing the first which he had taken in his mouth, turneth backe his mouth vnto the hinder: each of them in se∣uerall parts doe vex him: but he breathing foorth warlike strength, runneth here and there, this man he leaueth, that hee snatcheth vp on high: at the length being broken with long labour, and wearied, foaming in his mouth, he lyeth downe straight vpon the ground, and now being very quiet they binde him▪ and take him from the earth as if he were a Ramme. I doe also finde that lions are intricated in snares or traps, bound vnto some poste or pile, nigh vnto some narrow place, by which they were wont to passe. But Pliny saith, that in times past it was a very hard and difficult manner to catch ly∣ons, and that the chiefest catching of them was in ditches. In the mountaine Zaronius in Affricke, the strongest men doe continuall hunt lyons, the best of which being taken they send them vnto the King of Fesse : and the King orde∣reth his hunting in this manner: in a very spacious fielde there are little hutches built of that height as a man may stand vpright in them: euery one of these is shut with a little gate, and within standeth an armed man, the lyon being raysed and forced to that place the dores being open, then the lyon seeing the dores open, runneth with great force, which being shut againe, hee is prouoked to anger: Afterward they bring a Bull to combate with him, where beginneth a cruell fight, in which, if the Bull shall kill the Lyon, the honour of that day is finished, but if the Lyon ouercome him, all the armed men which in number are almost twelue, come foorth to fight against the lyon; Some of them hauing boare▪ speares of sixe cubits long: but if the armed men shall seeme to ouercome the Lyon, the King commaundeth the number to be diminished, and if on the contrarie, Leo Afer the armed men be ouercome: the King with his Nobles sitting in an high place to see the hunting kill the Lyon with Crosse-bowes, but it commeth often times to passe, that euery one of them is slaine before the lyon. The reward of those which combate with the lyon is ten golden Crownes, together with a new garment: neither are any admitted vnto this fight, except they are of a most praegnant and vailorous strength, and borne in the mountaine Zalag, but those which doe first of all prouoke and giue on-set to the lyons, are borne in the mountaine Zaronius. To conclude this discourse of the hunting of lyons. If it fortune that hee be fol∣lowed with men and dogges, Pliny yet in the plaine fieldes hee neuer mendeth his pace, as some writers affirme, oftentimes turning about and looking vpon his pursuers, as it were to dare their approchment, and to giue defiance vnto all their pretences: yet hauing gotten the thickets, he looketh to his safetie with his best celeritie and speede, so wisely tempeering his feare before his foes, that it may seeme a boldnesse, and so politiquely when he thinketh no eye seeth him, no longer dissembleth with himselfe, but runneth away like a fearefull Hart, Aristotle Albertus or Hare, laying downe his eares, and striking his taile betwixt his legges, like a curre-dogge, seldome times looking behind him, but most irefully vpon those that come before him, especially if he receaue from them any wound, where∣vnto Horace alluded saying: Quid vt nouerca me intueris, aut vt petita ferro bellua? In his course he spareth no beast that he meeteth, but falleth vpon it like a mad-dogge, (except swine) for he is afraid of their bristles; and if a man doe not attempt to wounde him, he will snatch at him, and ouerthrow him, but doe him little harme; according to these verses of Ouid: Corpora magnanima satis est prostrasse leoni Pugna suum finem, cum iacet hostis, habet. He obserueth most vigilantly the hand that woundeth him, and laboureth to take re∣uenge for the euill turne, and so it remaineth in his minde, till opportunitie send him his aduersaries head▪ as may appeare by this story following. When Iuba King of Moores, (the father of him which when he was a child was brought in triumphe) trauailed through the wildernesse with an army of soudiers, to represse cer∣taine rebels in one part of his dominion, which had shaken off his gouernement, and to settle them againe in their first allegiance. There was a noble yoong souldier in his traine, of the race of the nobilitie, and not only very strong, but also well experienced in hun∣ting, and by the way he with other of his fellowes met with a Lion, at whom he presently cast a dart, and gaue him a sore wound, but not mortall; after the wound receaued, the lyon went away guiltie of his hurt, and the yoong men did not prosecute him, but went forward on their iourney: After a whole yeare, the King returned homeward the same way, and his company that he carried with him, among whom was this yoong gallant that wounded the lyon: The lion hauing recouered his hurt, and hauing his denne neere the way and place of his harme, perceiuing a returne of the armie, went furiously among them and found out the man whose hand had wounded him, and could not by any help of his associats be stayed from a reuenge, but tore the yoong souldiour in peeces, and departed away safe, for the residue seeing his rage, ran all away, thinking him to be some deuill in the likenesse of a Lyon. After the taking of Lyons, it followeth that we should intreat of their taming, Of the ta∣ming of li∣ons. and first of all, they which are tamed in their infancy while they are whelpes, are most meeke and gentle, full of sport and play, especially being filled with meate; so that without danger, a stranger may meet with them: but being hungry, they returne againe to their owne na∣ture, for as it is true (which Seneca saith) Leonibus manus magister inserit osculatur Tigrim suos custos, that is to say. The maister of a Lyon may put his hand in his mouth, and the keeper of a Tyger may kisse him, yet is it also to be feard, Tigres leones{que} nunquam feritatem exuunt, aliquādo submittunt, & cum minime expectaueris, toruitas maligna redibit. Lions & Tygers do neuer leaue off their wildenesse, although somtimes they yeeld, and seeme to be submisse, yet vpon a suddaine when a man expecteth not, their malignant wrath brea∣keth forth, and they are exasperated. Wherefore after they grow to be old, it is impossible to make them vtterly tame, yet we read in diuers stories of tame Lyons, whether made so from their littering, or els con∣straind by the Art of man, such are these which follow; Hanno, had a certain Lyon, which in his expeditions of war carried his baggage, and for that cause the Carthagenians con∣demned him to be banishment, for said they, Male credi libertus ei, cui in tantum c cissit etiam feritas, It is not safe to trust such a man with the gouerment of the common welth, who by wit, pollicy, or strength, was able to ouercome, Coelius and vtterly to alter the wilde na∣ture of a Lion: for they thoght he wold proue a Tyrant that could bring the Lion to such meekenes, as to waite on him at Table, to licke his face with his toongue, to smooth his hand on his backe, and to liue in his presence like a little dogge. The Indians tame lions and Elephants, and set them to plough, Onomarcus, Aelianus the ty∣rant of Cattana, had lyons with whom he did ordinarily conuerse. In the countrey of Elymis there was a Temple of Adonis, wherein were kept many tame lyons which were so farre from wildnesse, and fiercenesse, that they would imbrace and salute the people that came in there to offer: Also if any one called them to giue them meate, they would take it gently, and depart from them with quietnesse: Likewise in the kingdome of Fes, in a plaine called Adecsen, there are certaine forrests wherein liue tame and gentle Lyons, which if a man meete, he may driue away with a small sticke, or wand, without receauing any harme; And in an other region of Affrick, the lyons are so tame, Leo Afer that they come dayly into Citties, and goe from one streete to another, gathering, and eating bones; from whose presence, neither women nor children run away. Likewise in many parts of India, they haue lyons so tame, A lianus that they leade them vp and downe in leames, and accustome them to the hunting of Bores, Buls, and wilde Asses like dogges, for their noses are as well fitted for that purpose, as the best hounds, as we haue shewed before of the King of Tartary. The best meanes to tame Lyons. And the best meanes of taming them is the rule of Apolonius, which he said was the precept of Pharaotes, which is, that they be neither handled too roughly, nor too mildly, for if they be beaten with stripes, they grow ouer stubborne, and if they be kept in conti∣nuall flatteries, and vsed ouer kindly, they grow ouer proud: For they held opinion, that by an equall commixtion, of threatning, and faire speaking, or gentle vsage, by which meanes they are more easily brought to good desired conditions, and this wisedome the auncients did not onely vse in the taming of Lyons, but also in restraining of tyrants, putting it as a bridle in their mouthes, and a hooke in their nosthrils, to restraine them from fury, and madnesse. Albertus saith, that the best way to tame lyons is to bring vp with them a little dogge, and oftentimes to beate the same dog in their presence, by which discipline, the lion is made more tractable to the will of his keeper. It is said of Heliogabalus, that he nourished many tame lyons, and Tygers, and other such noysome beastes, calling himselfe their great mother; and when he had made any of his friends drunke in the night time, hee shut them vp together (who quickly fell asleepe) through the heauinesse of their heads, who being so asleepe, he turned in amongst them some of his foresaid children, both ly∣ons, Beares, Tigers, and such like: at whose presence in the morning, his drunken frinds grew so amazed, that oft times, some of them fell dead for feare: and to conclude, there is a story in a certaine Epigram, of a lyon wandring abroad in the night time, for the auoi∣ding of frost, & cold, came into a fold of Goates: at the sight whereof the Goate-heards were much afraid, calling in question not onely the liues of the flocke, but also their owne, because euery one of them, thought himselfe bound to fight vnto death in defence here∣of: whereupon according to the manner of men in extremitie, they all made their pray∣ers, desiring God to be deliuered from the Lion, and according to their wishes so it came to passe; for after the Lyon had lodged in the warme folde of Goates a whole night, he departed in the morning, without doing any harme to man or beast; wherefore I take this Lyon to be of the tame kynde, and as in all beasts there are differences both of na∣tures, and inclinations, as we may see in dogs, some of them being more apt after the manners of men, and to be ruled by them then others, so also I see no reason, but that in the fierce, and royall nature of Lyons, some of them should be more inclinable, to obe∣dience, subiection, and submission; whereunto being once woon they neuer afterwardes vtterly shake off their vassalage and yoake of them which ouercome them. From hence it came, that there were so many spectacles, at Rome, as first of all Lucius Scilla, The triūphs, games and cōbats with Lions. in the office of his aedilitie, or ouersight of the Temple, brought into the Ro∣man circle, or ring, one hundred great maned Lyons loose, which alwaies before that time, were turned in bound, or mufled. And King Bochus sent so many valiant Archers, and dart-casters, to fight with them and destroy them. After him Pompey the great, in the same place brought in a combate, consisting of six hundred great Lyons, & among them there were three hundred fiftie maned Lyons: Also he instituted hunting of Lyons at Rome, Plutarcke wherein were slaine fiue hundred. Caesar when he was Dictator, presented in spec∣tacle foure hundred Lyons. Quintus Scaevola caused Lyons to fight one with an other. But Marcus Antonius, Pliny in the ciuill warre, after the battaile of Pharsalia, did first of all cause Lyons to be yoaked, and draw the Chariot of triumphes; wherein he himselfe sate, with one Citheris a Iester, which thing was not done, without shew and obseruations, of a prodigeous and monsterous action, and especially in those times, wherein it was inter∣preted, that as the noble spirits of those Lyons were so much abased, and vassalaged, insteede of horses to draw a chariot, they being in nature the King of beasts, so it was feared that the auncient nobilitie of Rome, the graue Senators, and gallant Gentlemen, commaunders of the whole common-wealth, should in time to come, through ciuill wars, and pride of the people, be depriued of all honor, and brought down to the basest offices, of the whole state, Antoninus Pius, nourished a hundred lions. Domician the Em∣peror, called for Acillius Gabrio the consull, into Albania, about the time that the games were celebrated, for the prosperity of youth and young men which were called Iuuenalia, to fight with a great lyon, and Acillius comming wisely into the combat did easily kil him. In ancient time when lions could not be tamed, they did discerne them by their teeth, and nailes, and so taking as it were the sting and poyson from the serpent, and the Weapons wherein consisteth all their strength, they were without all perill, sent into the publike as∣semblies, at the time of their generall meetings, and great feasts. Martiall hath an excel∣lent Epigram, of the great lion before exhibited in publike spectacle by Domitian, wonde∣ring that the Masilian and Ausonian shepherds were so afraid of this lion, & made as great a noise, and murmvr about his presence as if he had bin a heard of lions, and therefore he commendeth the Libian country for breeding such a beast, and withall expresseth the ioy of the shephards for his death, as are showne in these verses following; Auditur quantum Massyla per auia murmur, Innumero quoties sylua leo ne furit: Pallidus attonitos ad plena mapalia pastor Cum reuocat tauros: & sine mente pecus Tantus in Ausonia fremuit modo terror arena Quis non esse gregem crederet? vnus erat, Sed cuius tremerent ipsi quod{que} iura leones, Cui diadema daret marmore picta Nomas. O quantum per colla decus, quem sparsit honorem, Aurea lunatae cum stetit vnda iubae. Grandia quam decuit latum venabula pectus Quanta{que} de magna gaudia morte tulit? Vnde tuis Libie tam felix gloria syluis A Cybeles nunquid venerat ille iugis An magis Herculeo Germanice misit ab astro Hanc tibi vel frater, vel pater ipse feram. We haue shewed already that Lions although neuer so well tamed become wilde againe, Tame Lyons become wild againe. and that through hunger, which breaketh through stone Walles, according to the com∣mon prouerb, and therefore maketh them to destroy whatsoeuer commeth in their way, according to these verses of Virgill ; Impastus ceu, plena leu, per ouilia turbans Suadet enim vesana fames, mandit{que} trahit{que} Molle pecus, mutum{que} metu, fremet ore creuento. Such a one was the Lyon of Borsius Duke of Ferrara, who being in his caue would deuore Buls, Beares, and Boares, but with a Hare or little whelp he would play, and doe them no harme; at last leauing al his tamable nature, he destroyed a young wench, who oftentimes came vnto him to combe and stroke his mane, and also to bring him meat and flowers, vp∣on who Stroza made these two verses; Sustulit ingratus cui quondam plurima debens Pectendas{que} iubas, & fera colla dabat. The like vnto this also, was that tame lyon that Martiall speaketh of, who returning to his first nature, destroyed two young children, and therefore he saith iustly, that his cruelty exceedeth the cruelty of war, the Epigram is this: Verbera securi, solitus leo ferre magistri Insertam{que} pati, blandus in ora manum, Dedidicit pacem, subito, feritate reuersa, Quanta ne in libicis, debuit esse iugis Nam duo de tenera, puerilia corpora turba Sanguineam, rastris que renouabat humum, Seuus & infoelix, furiali dente peremit, Martia non vidit, maius arena nefas. Hauing thus spoken of the taming and taking lions, it also now followeth to entreat of the length of their life, The length of a Lyons life, and their diseases. and the diseases that are incident vnto them, with their seuerall cures: first therefore, it is held that they liue very long, as threescore, or fourescore yeares: for it hath beene seene, that when a lion hath bin taken aliue, and in his taking receiued some wound wherby he became lame, or lost some of his teeth, yet did he liue many yeares, & also it is found that some haue bin taken without teeth, which were all fallen out of theyr head through age, and Aelianus saith, that a lion and a Dolphin, doe both consume away through multitude of years. The sicknesses wherwithal they are anoid, are not very many, but those which they haue are continual: for the most part their intrals or inward partes, are neuer sound but subiect to corruption, as may appear by their spittle, & also by their biting, Albertus and scratching of their nailes, for a man lightly touched by them at sometimes is as much poysoned, as by the biting of a mad dog, also by reason of his extreame hot na∣ture euery each other day he suffereth one sicknes or other, at which time he lyeth pro∣strate vpon the earth, roaring not al the day long, but at certain houres, and in his wrath he is consumed through the heat inclosed in his own body. Cardan And in his best estate he is af∣flicted with a quartan Ague, euen then when he seemeth to bee in health, and except this disease, did restraine his violence and mallice by weakning of his body, he would be farre more hurtful to mankind then he is: and this is to be vnderstood, in the summer time he falleth into this disease sometimes at the sight of a man, & is cured by the bloud of dogs, according to Albertus and Physioligus, when he feeleth himselfe sick, throgh aboundance of meat, he faleth a vomiting, either by the strength of nature, or else helpeth himselfe by eating a kind of grasse, or green corne in the blade, or else rapes, and if none of these pre∣uaile, then he fasteth, and eateth no more till he find ease, or else if hee can meete with an Ape, he deuoureth and eateth his flesh, and this is the principall remedy and medicine, which hee receiueth against all his diseases, both in youth and age, and when he groweth old, being no more able to hunt Harts, Boares, and such beasts, he exerciseth his whole strength in the hunting, and taking of Apes, whereupon he liueth totally; and for these causes, there is a comparison betwixt the lion and the Dolphin, in Aelianus. Leoni, & del∣phino multa sunt communia, vter{que} imparat, ille terrenis, hic aquatilibus beslijs, senectute am∣bo tabescunt, & cum sunt in aegritudine, illa terrestris, simia medetur, huic marina, quod{que} si∣mia remedio est : that is, the lion and the Dolphin do agree in many thinges, both of them are kings, this ruleth ouer the beasts of the earth, and that ouer the beasts of the sea, both of them consume through age, and long life, and as the lion recouereth, by eating an Ape of the earth, so is the Dolphin cured by eating an Ape of the Sea, and thus much for the diseases and cure of lions. The vse of a Lyons seural parts. Vnto this naturall discourse of lyons belongeth the vse of their partes, both outward and inward, & also the seueral pictures and statues erected for their singular monuments. First therefore with the skins of lions were the ancient Moores and Barbarians, enhaby∣ting betwixt the mountaine Caucasus and the riuer Cophena, and so they appeared to Apol∣lonius and his companions, as also in the skins of Panthers, with both which, they did not onely cloth themselues in the day time, but also slept vppon them in the night, and ther∣fore Hercules is pictured wearing a lions skin, that the world might bee admonished what was the ancient attire of their forefathers. Virgill describeth Auentinus couered with a li∣ons skin in this sort: —Quem fulua leonis Pellis obit totum praefulgens vnguibus aures, And againe: Ipse pedes tegmen torquens immane leonis, Terribili impexum caeta cum dentibus albis, Indutus capiti, &c. And Aeneas sleeping vpon a lions skin, saying: Fului{que} in sternor pelle leonis, Aeneas Praecipium{que} toro, & villosi pelle leonis Accipit Aeneam. Adrastus was commaunded by the Oracleto marry his daughters to a boare and a lyon, when they came a wooing vnto them. Whereupon Tydaeus came in a Boares skinne, and Pollynices in a Lyons skin, vnto whom he gaue his Daughters in marriage, taking it to be the meaning of the Oracle, that men clothed in those skins should be the husbandes of his Daughters. From hence came the common prouerbe. Induitis me leonis exuuium, you put vpon me a Lyons skinne to signifie a man that taketh vppon him more then he is able to performe, and spend more then their condition will afford, and the beginning of the prouerb was taken from Hercules, who clothed in a Lyons skin as we haue said before, and bearing in one hand a Club, and in the other a bow, in which attire hee went downe to hell to fetch out Cerberus. Afterwards ther was one Bacchus which clothed with the same weede, and armed with the same weapons, in like sort in the imitation of Hercules, went down to hell, Ridiculous imitation. to heare the fayned disputation betwixt the two Poets, Euripedes, and Aesculus, at the sight whereof Hercules laughed, telling him, that such apparell did nothing at all become him, because he was wanton, tender, and effeminate. For it is not auaileable to haue a rich ceremony, and want the true substance; a glorious outside, and a shamefull inside, the Armor of a Champion, and the heart of a base coward, the outward shewes of holinesse, and the in∣ward loue of prophanes. Others do thinke that the prouerb was taken from that Asse cal∣led Asinus cumanus, who being weary of his seruitude and bondage, slipt collor, and ran away into the wilde woods, wher finding by chance a Lyons skin, hee crepte into it, and wore it vpon his body, vnder collour whereof, he rufled vp and downe the woods, to the terror of all the beasts, both with his taile and his fearefull voice: and the Cumanes them¦selues which had neuer seene a Lyon, were not a little affraid of this counterfeit beast. In this fashion he domineerd a good time, vntill at last there came a stranger to Cumae, who seeing the counterfeit personate Asse-lyon by the way, hauing oftentimes seene both ly∣ons and Asses, knew it for an Asse, in a lyons skinne, for if all other coniectures failed, yet this proued true, namely the length of his eares, wherefore he beat him wel, and brought him home to his maister, before whom he pulled off the lyons skin, and then his maister knew him to be his Asse. From which Socrates concludeth wisely, that no man ought to be afraid of outward greatnesse, because though the Asse was clothed with a lions skin, yet he was but an Asse. And that the skins of lyons was vsed in garments, the saying of Lysan∣der the Lacedemonian doth sufficiently proue; for when hee was blamed for his outward pompe, wherby he beguiled others, therfore condemned for foolish hipocricy, he made this answer, Quo leonis peruenire pellis non potest, vulpinam assuisse, de decuerit, euery man ought to haue two shutes of apparell, one of a Fox, and another of the lyon. For whether the lions skin cannot come the Fox wil creep, and vvher the fox cannot com the lion can. Coelius. Clothes wrapt in a lions skin, killeth mothes: also a mans body anointed with the fat of a lion mingled with garlike, so as the sauor of the garlike may ouercome the lions greace, The fat of Lyons Rasis. Albertus. he shal neuer be molested with wolus. Also if the folds of sheep be compassed about with the melted grease of lions, there is no wolues, nor rauening beasts will annoy the flocke. And so great is the feare of lions to wolues, that if any part of a lions grease be cast into a fountaine, the wolues neuer dare to drinke thereof, or to come neare vnto it. Also Pliny affirmeth, that if an Ammulet be made of lions grease, no man shal be harmed, wounded, or killed, by trechery or deceit: but you must vnderstand, Marcellus. Sextus. that this was an inuention of the Magicians or vvise-men, that by such pretences and promises of great matters, they might insinuate themselues, into the fauor of princes and noble men, and so make fooles of the world, and therfore they prescribe, the fat which is taken from betwixt the eie-lids or from the right part of their mouth or teeth, and the haires from the neather chap. It is likewise affirmed, that a man annointed all ouer with the blood of a lyon, shall neuer be destroyed by any wilde beast. There is an hearb which Democritus calleth Helianthe, growing in the Maritime Moun∣taines of Cilicia, and Themiscira, wherewithall the fat of lions, decocted with Saffron, and paulme wine with which al the kings of Persia were anointed, to make thē beautiful bodies to looke vpon. And aboue al other things, the Magicians prescribed this composition, Magical phy¦sicke for to be inuincible to make a man inuincible, the taile and head of a Dragon, the haires of a Lyons forehead, and the marrow of his bones, the spume or white mouth of a conquering Horse, bound vp together with a dogs clawes in a Harts skin, with the nerues of a Hart or Roe. The dung of a Lyon drunke in wine, maketh a man for euer more to abhor wine. It was also wont to be obserued, that when Lions forsooke the Mountaines and woods, to come and liue in fruitfull and fertil soiles, it did foreshew some great drought; and the like deuination did Agarista the mother of Pericles make vpon her dreame, when she was with child, Alex. ab alex for she thought she brought forth a lion, & so in short time after, she brought forth Pericles, who was a valiant man, and a great conqueror in Graecia. The sight also of a lion as a man trauaileth by the high waies, is very ominous, and taken for an euill signe. There was also a prophesie giuen out by Pythias, concerning Cypselus the Sonne of Eti which said in this manner; Concipit in petris aquila enixura leonem Robustum, soeuum, genua, & qui multa resoluet. Haec bene nunc animis, versate, Corinthia proles, Qui colitis pallenem, altam{que} Corinthium. In the yeare of our lord 1274. there was a certaine Noble Woman in the Bishopricke of Kostnizer, A monster like a lyon. which brought forth a child like to a Lyonesse in al parts but it had the skin of a man; The Images and seuerall statues of Li∣ons. vnto this discourse I may adde the Images of lyons, both in Temples, and also vpon shieldes, and first of all in the temple where the shield of Agamemnon hung vp, (as Pau∣cennius writeth) there was the picture ( Feare, ) drawn with a lyons head, because as the lyon sleepeth little, and in his sleepe his eies be open, so is the condition of Feare, for we haue shewed already, that the lyon when he sleepeth hath his eies open, and when he waketh he shutteth them, Coelius and therefore the ancients did simbolically picture a lyon vpon the doors of their temples, and vpon the ships also, in the forepart of them, they ingraued the figure of lions, Anthologius according to this saying of Virgil : — Aenaeia puppis Prima tenet rostro, phrigios subiecta leones. It was also a vsuall custome to picture lions about fountaines and Cundits, especially a∣mongs the Egyptians, that the water might spring forth of their mouths, Quomam ilus, aruis Egipti, nouam aquam inuehit, sole transeunte leonem, because that Nilus, did ouerflow the fields of Egypt, at what time the sun passed through the sign Leo. Therefore also the Riuer Al∣pheus was called Leontios poros, the lions fountaine, because at the heads thereof, there were dedicated the pictures of many lions. There was a noble Harlot called Leena, which was acquainted with the tiranies of Harmodius and Aristogiton ; for which cause, she was appre∣hended, Varrinus and put to greiuous tormentes, to the intent shee should disclose them, but she endured all vnto death, neuer bewraying any part of their counsell: After her death, the Athenians deuising how to honor that vertue, and because shee was a Harlot or common curtizan, Pausanias Atheneus they were not willing to make a statue for her in the likenesse of a woman, but as her name was Leena, that signifieth a lyonesse, so they erected for her the picture of a li∣onesse, and that they might expresse the vertue of her secrecy, they caused it to be framed without a toong: Vpon the graue of Layis there was a couering containing the picture of a lyon, holding a Ram in his forefeet by the buttockes, with an inscription, that as the lyon held the Ram, so do Harlots hold their louers, which Alciatus turned into this Epigram: Quia scalptus sibi vult aries quem parte leaena, Vnguibus apprensum posteriore tenet? Non aliter captos quod & ipsa teneret amantes Vir gregis est aries cluni tenetur amans. There was also a lyon at Delphos which waied ten talentes of gold, and at the entrance of Thermopilae vpon the tombe of Leonides the Captaine of the Spartans, there stood a Lyon of stone. Vpon the steps of the capital of Rome, ther were two lions of black Marble touch∣stone. Agricolae And the Cyziceni ingraued vpon one side of their money the picture of a Lyon, and on the other side the face of a woman. King Salomon built his Iuory throne vpon two Lyons of Brasse, and vpon the steps or staires ascending vppe to that throne were placed twelue Lyons, here and there. And from hence it came that many kings and states gaue in their armes the Lyon, Rampant, Passant, and regardant, distinguished in diuers coul∣lers in the fields of Or, Argent, Azure, and Sables, with such other termes of Art. The earth it selfe was wont to be expressed by the figure of a Lyon, and therefore the image of Atergas was supported with Lions. Sybale the fained Godesse of the Mountaines was ca∣ried vpon Lyons. And it is fained that the Curetes, which nourished Iupiter in Creete, who was committed to them by his mother Rhea by the anger of Saturn, Oppianus. Varinus. were turned into ly∣ons, who afterwards by Iupiter when he raigned were made the kinges of beasts, and by him enioyned to draw the chariot of his mother Rhea, according to this verse; Et iunctae currum, dominae subiere leones. There is a constellation in heauen called the Lyon, The constel∣lation of the Lyon. of whom Germanitus writeth in this sort, that he is the greatest and most notable amongst the signes of the Zodiack, contai∣ning three stars in his head, and one cleare one in his breast, and that when the Sun com∣meth to that signe which happeneth in the month of Iuly, at which time the vehement heat of summer burneth the earth, and dryeth vp the riuers. And therefore because the Lyon is also of a hot nature, and seemeth to pertake of the substance and quantity of the Sun, he hath that place in the heauens. For in heate and force he excelleth all other beasts as the sun doth all other stars. In his breastes and forepart hee is most strong, and in his hinder part more weake, so is the sunne, encreasing vntill the noone or forepart of the yeare, vntill the summer, and afterwardes seemeth to languish towards the setting, or latter part of the yeare called the Winter. And the Lyon also seemeth alwaies to looke vp with a fiery eye, euen as the Sunne which is patent with the perpetuall and infatigall sight vpon the earth. Macrobius. The Lyon also is a signification of the sunne, for the haires of his mane do resemble the streaming beames of the sunne, and therefore this constellation is stiled with the same epethites that the Lyon and the Sun are, as heate-bearing, aestiue, ardent, arent, calent hot, flammant, burning, Herculean, mad, horrible, dreadfull, cruell, and terrible. It is feigned of the Po∣ets that this Lyon was the Naemaean Lyon slaine by Hercules, which at the commaunde∣ment of Iuno was fostered in Arcadia, and that in anger against Hercules after his death, she placed him in the heauens. To conclude this story of the Lyons: it is reported of the Diuels called Onosceli, that they slew themselues sometimes in the shapes of Lyons and Dogges, and the Dogge of Serapis which was fained to haue three heads, on the left side a Wolues, on the right side a Dogges, and in the middle a Lyons. We haue shewed already, that the people called Ampraciotae did worship a Lyonesse because she killed a Tyrant. And the Egyptians buil∣ded a Citty to the honor of Lyons, calling it Leont polis, Lyons nori∣shed in Tem¦ples, and worshipped. and dedicating Temples to Vul∣can for their honor. And in the porches of Heliopolis, there were common stipends for the nourishing of lions. As in other places where they are fed daily with Beefe, and haue also windowes in their lodgings, with great Parkes and spaces allotted vnto them for their recreation and exer∣cises: with an opinion that the people that came vnto them to offer and worshippe them, should see a speedy reuenge through deuine iudgement vpon al those that had wronged them by periury, or broken the oath of fidelity. To conclude, in holy Scripture, we finde that our Sauiour Christ is called the Lion of the tribe of Iudah ; for as hee is a lambe in his innocency, so is he a Lion in his fortitude. The Deuil also is called a roaring Lion, because Lions in their hunger are most of al ful of furie and wrath. And so I wil conclude and end this storie of Lions, with that Emblem of Alciatus, describing how litle Hares did reioice and leape vpon dead Lions; Qui toties hostes vicerat ante suos, Dum curru et pedibus nectere vincla parant. Conuellant barba vel timidi Lepores. The medicines of the Lyon. The blood of a Lyon being rubbed or spred vpon a Canker, or vpon a sore which is swelled about the vaines, wil presently and without any paine cure and ease the griefe thereof. Albertus Sextus. Whosoeuer doth anoint his body all ouer with the blood of a Lyon, may safe∣ly and without any danger trauaile amongst any wilde Beastes whatsoeuer. The flesh of a Lyon being eaten either by a man or Woman which is troubled with dreames and fan∣tasies in the night time, Aescul pius. will very speedily and effectually worke him ease and quietnesse. The ame also being boyled or baked, and giuen to them which are distraught of their wits to eate doth bring them ease and comfort, and renew their wits againe: it is also very good for the paines or deafenesse of the eares. And being taken in drink, it helpeth those which are troubled with the shaking of the ioyntes or the Palsie. Whosoeuer shall haue shooes made of the hide or skinne of a Lyon or Wolfe and weare them vpon his feete, he shall neuer haue any paine or ache in them. Galen. They will also defend him that vseth them from the gout, or swelling in the feete or Legges. The skin or hide of a Lyon is also very good for either man or Woman which are troubled with the piles or swelling of the vains, if they shall but at some seuerall times set vpon it. The fat of a Lyon is reported to be contrary to poyson and venemous drinks, and be∣ing taken in Wine it will by the sent expell all wilde Beastes from any one: and it doth also resist and way the sent or smell of Serpents, by which they follow men to de∣stroy them. Whomsoeuer doth annoint his body all ouer with the tallow or sewet of the raines or kidny of a Lyon, shall by the sent and sauor thereof expell and driue away from him all Wolues, how greedy and rauenous soeuer they be. A man being throughly an∣nointed with the greace of a Lyon being melted▪ doeth driue away from him and put to flight any liuing creature whatsoeuer, and also venemous and poysonous Serpents them∣selues. Rasis. If any wilde beast bee annointed with the tallow or sewet of a Lyon which is dis∣solued and clarified, he shall nei her be troubled with the stinging of Flies or Bees. The fat or greace of a lyon being mingled with Oyle of Roses, doth keepe the skinne of the face free from all blastings and blemishes, being annointed thereupon, and doth also pre∣serue the whitenesse thereof, and being mingled with Snow Water, doth heale any flesh which is burnt or scortched vpon a man, and doth also cure the swelling of the ioynts. The sewet or fa of a lyon being mingled with other oyntments, and annointed vpon the pla∣ces of either man or woman who haue any blemishes in any part of their bodies, doth pre∣sently expel the same. The same vertue hath the dung or durt of a lion being mixed with the aforesaid vnguent. The greace of a lyon being dissolued and presently againe conglutinated together and so being annointed vppon the body of those who are heauy and sadde, it will speedily ex∣te pate all sorrow and griefe from their heartes. The same also being mixed with the mar∣row of an Hart and with lettice, and so beaten and bruised, and afterwards mingled alto∣gether, is an excellent remedy against the shrinking of the Nerues and sinewes, and the aches of the bones and knuckels about the legges being annointed thereon. The greace of a lyon by it selfe onely, mixed with a certaine ointment is also very profitable to expell the gout. The same being mingled with Oyle of Roses, doth ease and help those which are trou∣bled daiely with Agues and quartan Feauers. The same also being dissolued and poured into the eares of any one which is troubled with any paine in them, will presently free him from the same. There is also in this lyons Greace, another excellent vertue which is this, that if the aw-bone of any one be swelled and annointed ouer with this greace being melte , it will very speedily auoide the paine thereof. The fat or sewet of a Lyon being melted and mixed with certaine other thinges, and so ministred vnto any one that is troubled with the wringing of the bowels, and bloody flix, in the same manner as a glister is vsed, is commended for an excellent remedie for the same. The same also being mingled with a certaine oyle and warmed together, and anoin∣ted vpon the head of any one, whose haire doth s ed, or is troubled with the Foxes euill, Galen doth immediatly helpe and cure the same. The seede of a Hare being mixed with the fat of a Lyon, and annointed vpon the priuy members of any one, will stirre and incitate them vp to lust, how chast soeuer they shall be. The fatte of a Lyon mingled with the fatte of a Beare, and melted together, Myrepsus being anoynted vpon the belly, doth allay and asswage the hardnesse thereof, as also any other paine or griefe in the same. The braines of a Lyon, as also of a Cat, being taken in drink, doth make him mad vnto whom it is giuen. The same being mingled with some small quantitie of oyle of spike, Albertus and powred or distilled into the eares of any one which is deafe or thicke of hearing, will very effectually cure the deafenesse. If the eye teeth of a Lyon be hung about the necke of a yoong childe before that he cast his teeth, and the beginning of his second or new teeth, Rasis they will keepe him for euer from hauing any ache or paine in them. The hart of a Lyon being beaten into small powder, and taken in drinke, doth very speedily cure and heale those which are troubled with Agues and quartaine feauers. The liuer of the Lyon being dryed, Pliny and beaten to powder, and put in the purest wine which is possible to be gotten, and so drunke, doth take away the paine and griefe from any one which is troubled with his liuer. The gall of a lion being taken in drinke by any one, doth kill or poyson him out of hand. Betrutius But some doe impute this venome, to be in the gall of a leopard. The gall of a lion being mixed with pure water, and anoynted vpon the eyes of any one, will take away the ble∣mishes thereof, and cause them to see clearely: and the fatte of the lyon being added thereunto, is an excellent remedie against the falling sicknesse. Albertus A very little parte or dram of the gall of a lyon being put in wine and so drunke, will speedily helpe and cure those which are troubled with the yellow iaundise. The same disease is also cured by yel∣low carets being stamped and put in wine, and so giuen in drinke. For the sores or blemishes in the eyes, the gall of a lyon being mingled with hony, Galen and so anointed vpon them, is commended for a very speciall and effectuall cure or hea∣ling. The gall of a lyon, a Beare, or an Oxe be mixed with certaine other vnguents, is ve∣ry much vsed for the extending or moouing forward of conception. The right stone of a lyon being beaten together with roses, and so strained hard, Rasis vntill some liquid iuice or water doth proceede from them, and so taken in drinke, doth make that party barren, vn∣to whom it is giuen: it hath the like effect in it, if it be eaten, either roasted or broiled, or raw and bloodie. The fat which procedeth from the priuitie or secret parts of a she lyon being put in a vessell made of Iuory, and so being temperately mollified, Aetius is com∣mended for a very effectuall and speedy meanes to hinder conception. The dung, or dirt of a lyon being dryed into powder, and mixed with some certaine soft and easie oint∣ment, with which any one may be easily anointed ouer all his body, Albertus doth driue away the blemishes and spots in the skinne. The hurts or sores which are bitten either by a male or female lyon, are so full of mat∣ter and filthy corruption, that the running thereof can be stayed and repressed neither by lapping of cloathes about them, nor by washing them with spunges: Aristotle they are cured by the same meanes as the sores which are bitten by rauenous dogs are, as I haue before de∣clared in the cures of the Hyaena. The wounds which are made by the teeth of a lyon are very hurtfull: for as much as the venome of their interior partes doth goe into the wounds, and when the wounds are tyed, the venome issueth from them into the thinges with which they are tyed, and the same bindings being againe bound vpon the wound, doth so infect it, that it can be cured by no other meanes but by the aforesaid medicine. The bitings of lyons and such like beastes are so dangerous, in regard of their strength and fiercenesse, for they doe not onely bite, but also wreath and teare the wounds which they make with their teeth, or nailes: and thus much shall suffice for the cures of the Lyon. OF THE LYNX. The picture of a Linx, once in the Tower of London, which was first described by Doctor Cay. The names of the Linx. T He wilde beast which amongest the Germaines is named Luchss, by making a name from the Linxe, or as others write Lux, or Luxs : amongst the Italians is at this daie cal∣led Lupo ceruero, or Ceruerio, being engendered betwixe a Hind and a wolf; and likewise amongst the Rhaetians which speak Italian; and the Sabandians, and the Dalmatians or Illiriaus Ceruiro. But there was certaine Bohemian of late, which declared that the Linx as he coniectured, was called amongst the Illyrians Rys (and that it was called Luchss a∣mong the Germaines) but that amongest the Illirians was lesser then the other, yet verie like. The Spaniards do as yet cal him by the Latine name Lince, euen as certain Italian writers in their vulgar tongue, as Alunnus doeth testifie. In certain places in Heluetia, and about Sedu us, they call him Thierwolfe. Amongst the barbarous writers hee is called by the name of an Ounce : which I do suppose to be a Panther. Fr. Alunnus doth say, that this beast was called of certaine Italian writers in the vulgar tongue, Lonza, some interpreting it to be a Lionesse, some a Pardall, a Panther, or a Wolfe, engendered of a Hind and a Wolfe. Ounces do commonly seeme to be called rather Linxes, then Panthers: but although some late writers do attribute the name to a Leopard or a lesser Panther, Bellonius. it seemeth not∣withstanding corrupt from the Linx: for he is a creatur very like him both in his craft and shape of his body, but a Linx hath his taile shorter, and his longer. Auicenna Libards -bane doth kil Leopards and Linxes. THESE FIGVRES WERE TAKEN by Olaus Magnus, wherin the Linx pursueth a wild Cat. The Latines call this beast Lupus Ceruarius, and Linx of the Greeke word Lugx, from whence the German ein luchs : and it hath bene beleeued, The reason of the Latine names▪ that the Latine name was giuen vnto it, because they were ingendred betwixt a Wolfe and Hind, but there is no wise man that will suppose or be easily induced to beleeue, that beasts of such hostility, and aduerse dispositions in nature, should euer ingender or suffer copulation together▪ and therefore I rather suppose that it is called Ceruarius, either beeause it hunteth Harts and Hindes, or else because it imitateth their young ones in the outward colour and spots in the skinnes. There was a beast (saith Pliny ) which was called Chaus, and by the French Raphlus, brought in publicke spectacle by Pompey the great out of France, which in shape resembleth a wolf, and in spots a leopard; and therefore I think that Chaus, Raphlus, and lupus ceruarius, are diuerse names of one and the same wilde Beast, and yet by diuers writers it is confounded with the Thoes, or with the Panther, or with the Ounce. But I cannot agree thereunto, seeing it is written by Pliny, that about the Riuer Padus in Italy, there are certain beasts called Lynces, from whence commeth the Lyncurion, which by Zenothomis are called Langae, and by others Languriae. And Solinus also agreeth there∣unto, taking Lupus Ceruarius, for a kind of Linx. Some haue fabled that there is a Beast called Lynceus, Two kindes of Linxes. which Suidas and Varinus call Oxuderches : and they say, that the eies of it are the best sighted of al the beasts in the world. Oppianus maketh two kind of Linxes, one, a greater, and hunteth Harts and great Beastes, A story of a Linxe by D. Cay, taken in England by the sight of this beast in the Tower. the other a smaller and hunteth wilde cats and Hares. And first of all I wil set downe the description of this beast, according as it was taken in England by that learned Physitian D. Cay, whose words I do heere expresse. There is in the Tower of London (saith Iohn Cay ) a beast which eateth flesh, his whole body being of the greatnes of a lamb of two months old, hauing his head, mouth, feet, and nails, like to a cat. But concerning his beard, & taile, his bearde hangeth downe on both sides, diuided in the middle with sundry colours, the former being white, and the latter blacke: his taile is short and thicke, being from the middle to the vppermost part red, and to the lower part blacke: his eies being yellowe, the haire of the eye-lids obscurely waxing white. His eares erected vpright, as the eares of a catte, being replenished within with white haire, without couered with white and blacke, but so that the vpper parte is blacke, the middle, (for it is deuided into three parts) be white, and the lowest blacke againe. Neither is it content to be ended in his owne course, except also that his former partes, or the farthest brinkes or edges, and also his latter may be bended on the other side, in like manner as the edges of the priests hatte of the Graecian church are folded amongst the Venetians. In the top of his eares there are placed some blacke haires, as it were a foretop or tuft. The colour of this beast in the outmost parts is red, in the innermost white, but sprinkled here with blacke spots, and almost by rowes, and there with spots some-what lighter then the other, all his haire being for the most part white all ouer: all his body except the a∣foresaid spottes, as it is in certaine blacke skinnes of young Conies. And on both the sides of his nose there are foure spots set in order. In both his lippes, as now wee will de∣clare: in his vppermost lippe there are fiue orders or rowes, being of a very equall di∣staunce. In the first row, and the vpper, foure: in the second, fiue: in the third, eight: in the fourth, fiue; in the fift, there are foure, and these also euery one in his order, hauing an equall distance. In the lower lip there are onely seauen more manifest and euident, being placed in two rowes. In the first, four, to the very mouth of the lippe, in the second after them three others: after these, other lesser but not placed with so certain and true order as the vppermost. In the vpper lippe on both sides there are certaine white haires being rougher then those in Cats and Lyons. His nose, is somewhat of a pale red colour, being somewhat di∣stinct or apart from the rest of his face on euery side with a blacke line. Another line also doth deuide the outermost part of his nose by length (as in an Ounce) but onely be∣ing lightly lead by the toppe or highest parts, not impressed higher by the lower-most. The skinne of his feet is exceeding hard, and his nailes are hid in his feet (as the nailes of an Ounce and a cats are) neither doeth he put them forth at any time, vnlesse in taking of his prey as they do. He doth climbe wonderfully, so, that what he may be able to do in that thinge (either in his caue or den) nature her selfe doth teach. He is a quicke-moouing-creature, and cannot stand still in a place, so that except (by meer chance) the voice of a wood-pecker in the basket of a certaine country man (who came then onely to see the Lyons) had made him quiet and attentiue, there had bene no hope of the portraiting out the picture of his body. He being present he was most quyet: but he going away, hee would neuer stande still: wherefore I was constrained to send my man after the Countrey man to buy the birde, which beeing present, he stood very still vntill the busines was dispatched and the worke absolutely perfected. Our Country men call it Luzarne, it is doubtfull whether we shoulde call it Leunce, or Lynx, in the affinity of the words. His skinne is vsed by Noble-men, and is sold for a great price. He is angry at none but them which offer him iniury, his voice is like a cats, when he would snatch away the food from his fellow. He is louing and gentle vnto his keeper, and not cruell vnto any man, so farre Doctor Cay. Vnto this description of Doctor Caius, I may adde another description that was taken by the sight of the skinne of this beast. Another de∣scription ta∣ken by the ight of a skin The length whereof from the tip of the nose vnto the very taile, was foure spannes, and fiue fingers, and the length of the taile seuen fin∣gers, the bredth of the shoulder-blades of his backe, and the toppe of his necke was two palmes, six fingers, and a spanne; the length of his forelegges a spanne and fiue fingers, and the length of his hinder-legges, a spanne and three fingers, the haire was very softe, but yet thicke and deepe, the tippes of the haire vpon his back were white, but in the nea∣ther most parts they were red, and they are most white which fall downewardes on boeth sides from the middle of his backe. In the middle they are more redde and dusky, the middle of the belly, and especially the lower part is white, but both sides of it are white and red, and euery where vppon his belly there are black spots, but most plentifull in the bottome of the belly, and on both sides. The vppermost part of his necke, right ouer against his eares, hath great blacke spottes, his eares are small, and not bigger then a little Triangle, in the edges they are black, although with the blacke haires there are mingled some white. His beard is mixed with blacke, and white haire, which haire is great like to bristles. The teeth are most white and the vpper canine teeth hange ouer the neather, the breadth of a finger, whereof sixe are small, and of those sixe two are the greatest, and all the residue are very small on the neather chapp, and to conclude, al the teeth were like a common Weasils or Martill: his feet were very rough, being fiue distinct clawes vpon the fore-feete, and foure vppon the hinder, which clawes were very white and sharpe. The taile was of equal bignesse and thicknes, but in the tip thereof it is blacke. The price of a Lynxes skin These skinnes are sold for three Nobles a peece, and sometime for six, and sometimes for lesse, according to the quantity of the skinne and countrey wherein it is sold. And vnto this de∣scription do Bellonius and Bonarus agree. For Bellonius at Constantinople saw two Lynxes, Countries of Lynxes. much like vnto cats, and Bonarus had oftentimes seene them hunted in Moschouia, Littu∣ania, Pollonia, Hungaria, and Germany: But he commendeth aboue al other the Linxes of Scotland and Swesia, as most beautifull, hauing Triangular spots vpon theyr skinnes. But the Indian and Affrican Linxes, he saith haue round spots, sharpe-bristly-short-haire, and full of spots on all parts of their body, and therefore they are not so delicate as the Linxes of Europe, which with good cause he coniectureth to be the Linxe that Pliny speaketh of, and not vnlike to that which is bred in Italy. There are Linxes in diuers countries, as in the for named Russia, Littuania, Pollonia, Hungary, Germany, Scotland, so also they are most abundant in Scandinavia, in Swesia, so also about▪ Hyelsus, and Helsyngia : likewise in all the Regions vpon the Alpes, and in Sylua Martia, they are also very plentiful in Aethiopia, in France and Italy, about the riuer Padus, and in the Island Carpathus : and thus hauing dis∣coursed of their country and proportion, whereby their differences and kindes may bee discerned, we will leaue euery one of them to their particular, and proceed to the treatise and description of their general natures. There is no great difference betwixt their outward shapes and proportion, for both the smaller and the greater haue bright eies, diuers coloured skins, a little head, Their out∣ward shape and seueral partes a nim∣ble and cheareful face, and ( Albertus saith) that their body is longer then the body of a Wolfe, but their legges shorter, mistaking the Linxe for the Thoes. Their eyes stande forth of their heads very far, their tongue like the toong of a Serpent, (and Textor affir∣meth) that they haue pappes or vdders in their Breastes, but surely hee taketh Linxe for Sphinx. Their meat goeth into the belly straight through the maw, without staying, and there∣in is a note of their insatiable voracity, for none but insatiable beasts or birds are so affec∣ted, as in birds, the Cormorant. It hath no ankle bone, but a thing like vnto it, the nails are very long, as you may see in two of the former pictures, but hee hideth them within his skin til he be angry, ready to fight or climbe, or otherwise affected, as you may see by the picture of the Linx taken in the Tower of London. The inward proportion and anatomy of their bodies is like vnto a mans, and therefore Galen giueth this lesson to students in Phisicke, Praestat simiarum homini, quam similima∣rum artus dessicare, cum te in exemplo, exercere institues, sin ea non detuo, aliquam ei proximam delegito, aut si nulla omnino Simia reperiatur, Cynocephalum, vel Satyrum, vel Lincem, summa∣tim ea omnia, quibus artuum extrema, indigitos quin{que} discreta sunt. That is to say. It is good to discect those bodies which are likest to a man, when one would instruct himselfe in anatomy, and if he cannot find an Ape, let him take a Baboone, a Satyre, or a Linx, and generally any creature, the extremity of whose sinnewes and ioynts are diuided into fiue fingers or toes. There be some that haue thought, that Panthers, Pardals, Linxes, or Tygers, hadde bin all of the kind of cats, because of a mutuall resemblance in the greatnesse and strength of their nailes, in the distinction of their skinnes, which are partye coloured and faire, ha∣uing also a round head, a short face, a long taile, a nimble body, a wilde mind, and gette their meat by hunting: but heerein I leaue euery man to his owne best liking and opini∣on: for when we haue done our best to expresse their natures and seuerall properties, it shalbe ydle to spend time about disputation to what ranke or order, euery beast ought to be referred. For euery one that readeth our story and seeth our pictures may either bee satisfied, The or els amend our labour. The Linx therefore biteth most cruelly and deepe, and therefore is accounted, Rap a animal, instar lupi sed callidius, a Beast as rauening as a wolfe, but more crafty, they get vp into trees, and from them leape downe vppon very great beastes, and destroy them, bee∣ing enemies both to men and beasts, and at their pleasure, according to necessity, set vp∣pon both. the of They are taken somtimes in Germany, in the dutchy of Wertinberg, and that it was once credibly affirmed, one of them leaped downe from a tree vppon a countrey man, as he passed vnder the same tree, but being weary, and hauing an axe on his necke, he receiued her on the sharp edge thereof, and so killed her, otherwise she woulde soone haue killed him. meat or foode. They liue in the mountaines also, where they are killed by poison, or else hunted by armed men on horse-back, and included with multitudes, for their hunting is perilous, and therefore they must be inclosed with great company. Some take them with ditches as we heard before Lyons were taken, others in snares or ginnes laide vppon the rockes, and stones, and whensoeuer they are hunted with Dogs, they run directly to the woods or to the next trees, wherein they are killed by gun-shot. In the Summer time they are very weake and liue among the Rockes, neuer strayinge farre from their owne lodging, hurting no man vntill the autumn. They hunt wilde goats, whom they follow from Rocke to rocke, leaping as fast, or faster then the Goates. They hunt also wilde cats and Hares, and some other little beasts, but the greatest Linxes hunt Hartes and Asses, Ola mag. and their manner is as wee haue saide already, to get vp into trees, and there to ly in waite for their prey, vntill they espy it vnder the boughes, and then sudden∣ly leape into the necke thereof, whether it be a man or a great Beast, wherein they fix their clawes so fast, that no violence can shake them off, but with the sharpenesse of their teeth, bite into the scull, and eate out the braines to the vtter destruction of the man or beaste, whomsoeuer they light vpon, but if it be a small beast, they eate the whole body thereof, and not onely the braines. A singular note of for∣getfulnesse, Yet this is a wonderfull secret in their nature, that although they belong afflicted with hunger, yet when they eate their meate, if they heare any noise, or any other chaunce cause them to turne about from their meat, out of the sight of it, they forgette their prey, notwithstanding theyr hunger, Pliny. and goe to seeke another bootey, neuer remembring that which they had before them, Solinus. nor yet returne backe againe to eate thereof. The voice of this beast is called by a speciall worde in Latine, Orcare, or Corcare, which I may English croaking, or whining, for the voice thereof is not great, and therefore the Author of Phi∣lomela saith, dum linxes orcando fraemunt, vrsus ferus Vncat, while the Linxe croaketh, the wilde beare whineth. And Arlunus saith, Corcare vox lupae Ceruarij, to croake is the voice of a Linx. the voice of Linx s. sight of Linxes. It is thought that of all beastes they seeme most brightly, for the poets faine, that their eie-sight pierceth through euery solid body, although it be as thicke as a wall; yet if you offer vnto it any thinge which is transparent, it is much offended, and sometimes blinded, but I cannot tell, whether the sight be attributed to the Linxe truely accordinge to nature, or fabulously in imitation of the poeticall fiction of Lynceus, of whome it was saide in auncient time, that hee sawe thorough stone Walles, of whome Horace writeth thus: Non possis oculo, quantum contendere lynceus Non tamen id circo, contemnas lippus in vngi. Marcus Tullius also saith in this manner, O pheus▪ in the admiration of Lynceus eye-sight, as thogh darkenes did not hinder it, quis est tam lynceus qui in tantis tenebris nihil offendat. Apolloni∣us saith, that so great was the perfection of this mans eye-sight, as he was beleeued to see perfectly downe into the earth and what was don in Hell. Plutarch saith, that he could see thrugh trees & rocks. Pausanias writeth, that he was a king, and raigned after Danaouita. Pyndarus writeth that Ida and Lynceus were the sons of Aphaneus, and that a contention growing betwixt Ida and Castor and Pollux at the marriage of Helena because they twaine would haue rauished Phoebe and Ilayra, the wiues of Ida, The Fables of the Poets about Lin∣ceus. and Lynceus did therefore slay Castor, and afterwards Lynceus slew Pollux when he spyed him lie vnder an Oake, from the mountaine Taygetus. Wherefore Iupiter slew Ida with lightning, and placed Castor and Pollux in heauen a∣mong the stars. There was another Lynceus husband of Hypermnestra, Theocritus Daughter of Da∣naus, which Danaus hauing commanded all his daughters in the night time to kill their husbands, she onely spared hir husband Lynceus. But the truth is, that Lynceus of whom there is so many fables of his eiesight, was the first that found out the mines of gold, Coelius. siluer and Brasse in the earth, and therefore simple people seeing him bring golde and siluer out of the earth, and comming now and then vpon him while he was a digging deepe for it, vsing the light of Candles, which he neuer brought out of the pits, they foolishly ima∣gined, that by the sight of his eies he was first of all led to seeke for those treasures, Palaephatus and from hence came the common prouerb. Lynceo perspicacior, for a man of excellent eye-sight; and to conclude others say, that Lynceus could see the new Moone the same day or night that she changed, and that therefore the fame of his eye-sight came so to be cele∣brated, because neuer any mortall man saw that sight himselfe excepted. And from these fables of Lynceus came the opinion of the singular perspicacity of the beast Linx: of whom as I said before, as the sight is very excellent, and so farre excelling men, (as Galen saith) like as is also the sight of Egles, so I do not hold any such extraordinarie and miraculous sence to be in this beast, after any other manner, then the Poets did feigne it to be in Lyn∣ceus, except as before said, Omnes imbeciliore sumus cernendi potestate, si aquilarum et Lyncis, acuminibus conferamur. And therefore the prouerb before spoken of, may as well bee ap∣plyed metaphecically to the beast Linxe, as poetically to the man Lynceus, and so much may suffice for the sight. It is reported also that when they see themselues to be taken they do send forth teares and weepe very plentifully. Their vrine they render all backewards, N. Spreng : Their vrine and teares or weeping Vrine conge¦led into a me¦dicinal sto e not onely the female but the male also, wherein they differ from all other beasts: and it is said of them, that they knowing a certaine vertue in their vrine, do hide it in the sand, and that thereof commeth a certaine pretious stone called Lyncurium, which for brighnesse resembleth the Amber, and yet is so congealed and hardned in the sand that no carbuncle is harder, shining like fire, wherewithall they make sealing rings, which caused Ouid to write thus: Victa, racemifero Lyncas dedit India Baccho Equibus vt memorant quicquid vesicaremisit Vertitur in lapides, & congelat aere tacto. But they say that of the male commeth the fiery, and yellowe Amber, and of the female commeth the white and pale Amber. In Italy they call it Langurium, and the beast Lan∣guria, and Lange. This Lyncurium is called of some Electrum, Pterygophoron, and they say it is the same which will draw vnto it leaues, strawe, and plates of Brasse and yron, accor∣ding to the opinions of Diocles, and Theophrastus, and that being drunke out of Water is good for the stomacke, and very conuenient for the fluxe of the belly, according to Dio∣scorides, and that it cureth the paines of the reines, and healeth the kings euill, according to Solinus ; And Theophrastus goeth about to establish this opinion by reason, and laboreth to perswade it as probable, that the vrine of a Linx, should congeale into a stone among sand, as well as the vrine of a man, to ingender a stone in the raines or in the bladder. And of this opinion is Pliny, Theophrastus, Hesychius, Varinus, Zenothimis, Plutarch, and Aristotle. But in my opinion it is but a fable: For Theophrast himselfe confesseth that Lyncu∣rium, which he caleth Lyngurion, and Amber Hualos, is digged out of the earth in Lyguria. Sudines, & Metradorus say that there is a certain tree in Lyguria, out of which amber is ta∣ken, & this tree is the blacke Popler, & it is also very probable, that seeing this Amber was first of all brought into Greece out of Lyguria, according to the denomination of all strange things, they called it Lyngurium after the name of the country, whereupon the ig∣norant La ines did feigne an etimology of the worde Lyncurium, quasi Lynxis vrinam, and vppon this weake foundation haue they raised that vaine buildinge; and for further de∣monstration of this truth, ( Dioscorides saith) in his discourse of the Popler, that it grow∣ing about the riuer Euridanus, sendeth forth a certaine humor like teares which groweth hard, whereof they make that which is called Electrum, being rubbed, it smelleth sweete, and for that it hath not onely power to draw vnto it, Brasse, Iron, and such thinges, but a so gold; It is also called Chrysophoton ; vnto this Lucianus subscribeth, and whereas it was said that in Italy this Amber▪stone is begotten, neare the riuer Padus, where stand ma∣ny white Poplers, my coniecture is, that some such like humor may issue out of them, & not onely by accident, but through affinity of nature, and condensate into a stone, which the people finding, couered in the sand vnder the trees, and through their former perswa∣sion, might easily take it for the stone ingendred by the vrine of the Linx. Hermolaus also writeth this of the Lycurium, that it groweth in a certaine stone, and that it is a kind of Mushrom, out of . or Padstoole which is cut off yearely, and that another groweth in the roome of it, a part of the roote or foot being left in the stone, groweth as hard as a flint, and thus doth the stone encrease, with a naturall fecundity: which admirable thing (saith he) I could neuer be brought to beleeue, vntill I did eate thereof in myne owne house. Euax (as is recyted by Syluaticus saith) that the vrine of the Linx, domi seruatus, gene∣rat optimos sungos supra se quotanis, reserued at home in ones house, bringeth forth euery yeare the best Mushroms. This is also called lapis Litzi, and lapis prasius, which is deui∣ded into three kindes, that is Iaspis, Armeni cus, and lapis phrigius, called also Belemintes ; wherewithall the Chirurgians of Prussia and Pomerania, cure greene wounds, and the Phi∣sitians breake the stone in the bladder. But the true Lyncurium which is extant at this day, and currant among the Apothecaries, is as light as the Pummis-stone, and as big as filleth a mans fist, being of a blackish colour, or of a russet; the russet is more solide, sandy, and fat, and being bruised or eaten, tasteth like earth: both kinds are couered with little white skins, and there is apparant in them, a spungy tenatious substance, and this I take to be the Mushrom, whereof Hermolaus speaketh. And by the little stones and small skinnes, it may be coniectured to be corpus heterogones, interracoalescens: A Hetrogenian body, encrea∣sing in the earth, wherewithall it hath no affinity. There was another stone of the vrine of a Linx to be seen in Sauoy, the substance wherof was clearely christal, the forme of it was triangular, the hardnes so, as you might strike fire with it, and the colour partly white, and partly like wine mingled with water, so that I will conclude, that the vrine of a Linx may engender a stone, though not in such manner as is before saide. For the Arabian Iorath affirmeth, that with in seauen daies after the ren∣dring, it turneth into a stone; but it is not the Lyncurius property so called, for that is the Amber or gum before spoken of, although catacrestically so called. And if it be true, that there bee certaine Mushroms neare the red-sea, which by the heat of the sunne are hardned into stones, then also it may follow very naturally, that those stones may produce Mushroms againe, for both the dissolution and the constitution of things are thought to be grounded vpon the same principles. And thus much shal suffice for the vrine of the Linx, and the stone made thereof. The skins of Linxes are most pretious, & vsed in the garments of the greatest estates, both Lords, Vses of theyr seue parts. P rus. Kings, and Emperors, as we haue shewed before, and for that cause are sold very deare; The clawes of this beast, especially of the right foote, which hee vseth instead of a hand, are e cluded in siluer, and sold for nobles a peece, and for Amulets to bee worne a∣gainst the falling sicknesse. The loue of these beasts to their young ones is very great, like as the Pardals Lions, and Tygers. The king of Tartaria hath tame Linxes which he vseth in hunting instead of dogs. The ancient Pagans dedicated this beast to Bacchus, feigning that when he triumphed in his chariot of vine branches, hee was drawne by Tygers, and Linxes. Lynxes ta∣med. And therefore Virgill saith, Quid Lynces Bacchi variae, And Ouid : Dicta racemifero, Lyncas dedit India Baccho. Al the nailes of a Linx being burned with the skin, beaten into powder, and giuen in drink will very much cohibite and restraine abhominable lechery in men: the medcines of the Lynx. it will also restraine the lust in women being sprinkled vpon them: and also very effectually and spedily take away either itch or scurfe in man or womans body. The vrin of this beast is accounted ve∣ry medicinable for those which are troubled with the strangury, or running of the raines. The same is also very good and wholesome for the curing of any paine or griefe in the wind-pipe or throat, Pliny. Bonarus Baro doth affirme that the nailes of Linxes which are in their country, are had in great estimation and price amongst their piers or noble men: for there is a very certaine opinion amongst them, that those nailes being put vpon the yeard of ei∣ther horse or beast whose vrine is kept backe or restrained, will in very short space cause them to void it without any griefe at al. He reporteth also that their nailes doe there wax white, and that they include them all in siluer, and do commend them for an excellent re∣medy against the cramp, if they be worne (peraduenture because they are bending and crooked) by which perswasion ther are some superstitious men which hang certain rootes which are crooked and knotty about them, against the crampe. There are likewise some which do ascertaine that these nailes are good and ready helpes for the sorenes of the vn∣ula which is in Horses mouthes: and for that cause there are many horsemen which carry them continually about them. The Linxe or wolfe, which is begotten of a wolfe and a Hinde, the Musk-cat, Arnoldus. the wea∣sell and al such other like beasts, do more hurt men by their biting teeth-wounds then by poison. There was a certaine hunter as Collinus reporteth, which told him that the flesh of a Linx being sod in some whot pottage or broth, and afterwardes eaten, would be a very good and wholesome medicine for the expelling of the Ague, or quartan feauer: and that the bones of the same beast being brent and pounded into powder, would be a very excel∣lent remedy for the curing of wounds which are old and stale, and ful of putrifaction, as also the Fistulaes which grow in the thighes or hips of men. Of the Marder, Martell, or Marten. T His beast is called in the Hebrew Oach, or as some say Zijm, amongst the Arabians Eastoz, or rather Kacheobeon, The seueral names or Ka∣chineon, in Latine Martes: the Germans Marder, or Marter like the english, the Italians Marta, Martore, or Martorello, the French Mardre or Foyne, the Spaniards Marta, the Illiri∣ans and Polonians Kuna, and some later Latins vse these words Marta, Martarus, Marturus, and Marturellus, & the reason, or etimoligy of this Latin worde is taken from Mar∣tia, which signifieth Martial, because this beast in warlike & hostill manner, destroyeth her aduersaries, two kinds of Martens and liueth vpon the prey, of hens, birds, and Mice. The Germans deuide these into two kinds, which they call by the names of Tachmarder, Hussmarder, Steinmarder, Buochmarder, Feldmarder, Wildmarder, Thanmarder, Fiechtmarder, that is to say, The fir-Martin, the rock-Martin, the tame-martin, the beech-martin, the field-martin, the wild-martin, and the wall-mar∣tin. For they liue either in houses, wals, and temples, or else in rockes, fields, and woods: And yet is not their distinction, taken onely from the places of their aboad, but also from the goodnesse of their skins. Places of their abode. And therefore the French call the word Martin by the name of Foines : And the skins of the firre-martin, or house-martin, are far more beautifull to looke vppon, then those that liue wilde in the trees or woodes. Agricola calleth the wood-martin Baummarder, by∣cause it liueth for the most part in trees, and saith that it neuer forsaketh the woodes or very sildome, and therefore in that thing differeth from the firre-martin. But heerein he seemeth to be deceiued, that he ascribeth to the beech-martin, a loamie or red throat, and also a continuall aboad among the woods. For they come sometimes to houses, and to rocks, for which as we haue said already, it is called a house-marder, & rock-marder. And al these multitude of names, doe but expresse the two kinds afore named, whereof the firre- Martin, is most excelent, The vse of their skins & how to chuse the best. for princes The picture of the Marten. and great Nobles are clothed ther∣with, euery skinne being woorthe a French crowne, or foure shillinges at the least. And they are so much the beter, when there are more whit haires aspersed among the yellowe. For their ordinary colour is a deep browne yellowe, and these that are cleane white, are foure times worse then the former; and therefore are not solde for aboue three or foure groats a peece, howsoeuer the say∣ing of Martiall, Venator capta Marte superbus ad est. Heere commeth the proud hunter that hath killed a Mar¦tin, may very well be applyed vnto them which take any of these beasts, for they cannot chuse but bee very ioyful, which get a good sum of mo∣ny for a little labour as they haue for a martins skin. Difference betwixt Foynes and Martens By inspection of the Foines, that is; The martins of the beech, for the Frenchmen called a Beech Fau, from whence commeth the word Foines, you may see, that that their skins are more dusky, ha∣uing a tail both greater and blacker then the martins of the firres. And therefore you must vnderstand, that they of the Firs, are by way of exce∣lency called martins, and the other of the woods called Foines. There is no great difference betwixte theyr bignes: and if by their skins at any time there seeme any inequality, in breadth, or length, it must be attri∣buted to their age and difference of years, and not to any proportion in nature or distinction of kind. And as we haue said that the fir- martins are absolutly the best, yet that is not to be vnderstoode generally. For the martins of Pollonia are so brown, that they are altogither disliked, and are accounted no better then the common beech- martins. Wherefore the bright-browne a∣spersed with white haires, Regions bree¦ding Martēs. is euer accounted more pretious without all exception, and by that colour vpon the backe of the skin, the skinner iudgeth of the woorth, and not by the yellownesse of the throat. Of these Beech-martins there are great plenty in the Alpes, especially on the South-side, which look towards Italy, but verie few of the wal-martins. But on those parts of the Alpes which looke towards Germany and the North, there are a∣boundance of fir-martins with yellow throates, for you must remember that the wilde martin hath a white throat, and the firr-martin a yellow throat. There are also of both kinds in Heluetia, Eras. Stella and the most excellent are in the vailes towardes the Alpes. In France there are no Martins of the wall, but the beach Martins liue in hol∣low beaches. There are also woods full of these beastes in Brussia, which the people there call Gayni. Lanzaerucca a wood of Scandenauia fourescore mile long, is full of Martins. Al∣so Muscouey, and Littuania haue store of these beasts, and Sabels. But they of Littuania, O ius. Mag. are the whitest in the world. The people of Surmasia in Europe, weare garments of these in sables; and the inhabi∣tants of Scithia, Hungaria, neare Tanayois, do pay yearly vnto the Emperor of Rushia, Io. Bohemus once called the Duke of Muscouia, a certaine number of Sabels, and Martins skins. There are al∣so store of Martins neare Bragansa, and generally in all parts of Europ except in England. They are in quantity about the bignes of a Cat, hauing longer bodies, but shorter legges, with heads and tailes like a Fox, their skins ordinarily broune, white on the throat, their quanti∣ty and seural parts. & more yellow on the back. Their teeth are exceeding white, and vnequall, one longer then ano∣ther, being aboue measure sharp, and the canine teeth both aboue and beneath hang out very long. Amongst which on the neather chap, stand sixe small cutting teeth in a right line ouer against one another, which I thinke happeneth not in any other beast of the world. The grinding teeth are like a saw, being triangular in fashion, eight aboue, & eight beneath. Whereof the furthermost vppon the vppermost side of the mouth, are more deepe, and inward in the pallat; then all the residue, the whole number is thirty two. The long haires vpon their vpper lip do bend cleane backwards. Notwithstanding that there be two kindes of this beast as already we haue saide, yet do the Wood-Martins, or beach-Martins, greatly desire copulation with the other, wherefore Albertus saith miscen∣tur inter se haec genera, & Martes thagi, fere sequitur, Martem abietum, tanquam nobiliorem, their copula¦tion vt foetum ex ea nobiliorem acquirat. The beech-Martin followeth the firre Martin, and de∣sireth her copulation as the nobler kinde, that he may thereby dignifie his owne yssue. It should seeme that they breede in March, and make their nestes, like the draies of squir∣rels, and bring forth many at a time; For it was constantly affirmed, by a country man of Germany, that he found a nest of these Martins builded like a Squirrelles, hauing foure young ones in it, in the beginning of Aprill. If they be taken when they be young, both one and other kind grow wonderfull tame and familiar with men and dogs. And Gesner had one of these, the taming of Martins which loued a little Dog wonderfully, and would follow him abroad whether soeuer he went, far or neare. It would also play with dogs and men, with teeth and nailes, lying flat vpon the backe like a Cat, and neuer giue any litle hurt. But losened frō his chain it would wander abroad into the neigh∣bors houses, and many times far off, but alwaies returne home againe. They which tame them because that they are easily exasperated, and bite deepely when they are angry, doe breake off the tops of their canine teeth with a paire of pinsons, for the preuenting of that mischiefe. Ruellius affirmeth, that the excrement of this beast smelleth like a musk-cat, their Food. and saith the reason of it is, because they feede vpon sweete fruits; but we haue heard that they eate pullin birds, eags, and mice, but that they eate of fruits it cannot be proued. I rather attribute it vnto their owne nature. For as the Martin ape smelleth sweetly after hir meat, so may this Martin-weasel render a sweet excrement, to conclud, the skins of these beasts is applyed to gouty legs, and the white haires of the throat made into a cap, is very suffe∣rant for the headache. They may be taken with dogs, or in traps, but commonly they are taken in ditches or pitfals, acording to this verse of Calentius, wherwithall I will conclude. Et laqueo vulpes, & decipe, casse, foinas. OF THE MOLE OR WANT. I Do vtterly dissent from all them that holde opinion that the Mole or Want is of the kinde of Myse, for that all of them in generall, both one and other haue two longe crooked fore∣teeth which is not in Moles, The seuerall names. and therfore wanting those as the inseperable propriety of kind; we wil take it for graunted that it pertaineth not to that ranke or order of four-footed-beasts. But concerning the Haebrew name thereof, there is much va∣riance, and little certainety amongst writers. Some of them cal∣ling it Tinschemet, which word is found Deut. 14. which is also translated by the Chaldees Bota or Baueta a swan, and the Septuagints and Ierom, Ibis, & Rabbi Salomon in another place of the same Chapter translate it a Bat, which the French call Chaulue-souris. But in that place of Leuit. 11. where the Stellio, the Lyzard, and Tinsche∣met are reckoned vncleane beastes, Rabbi Salomon interpret it Talpam the Mole. The Sep∣tuagints Aspalax, the Chaldee Aschuta, the Arabian Lambaraz. The Persian Angurbah-Dedach. There is a sentence Esay. 2. in Haebrew thus. Lachepor perot velatalephim, which by Munster is thus translated. In die proijciet homo aureos & argenteos deos, infossur as taipa∣rum & vispertilionum. In that day shal a man cast away his goods of siluer and gold into the holes of Moles and Bats. By S. Ierom it is translated thus: Proijciet homo Idola, vsque vt adoraret talpas & verspertiliones. A man shall cast away his Idols to worship Moles and Bats. Some a∣gaine make but one word of Lacheporperot, and translate it a beast digging ditches: and the Septuagints, ydols or abhominations, and thinke that they were so called because their outwarde forme representeth some such reptile creature, and Symmochus, vnprofitable things: but Aquila Orugas, digging-beasts: and therefore at this day all the learned take Perot for Moles, so called by reason of their digging. Auicen calleth it Pelagoz, a blinde Mouse. In Greeke it is called sometimes Spalax, but more often Aspalax : yet Albertus calleth it by a strange Graecian name Colty and Koky, which he tooke from Auicen. The Italians retaine the latine word Talpa, the Spaniards Topo, by which word the Ita∣lians at this day call a Mouse. The French call it Taulpe, the Germaines Mulwerf, and in Saxon, Molwurffe, from whence is deriued the English Mole and Molewarpe. The Helueti∣tians Schaer and Schaermouse, and the Molehil they cal Schaerufen of digging. The Hollanders and the Flemmings call it Mol and Molmuss, in imitation of the German worde: the Illyri∣ans Krtize. And generally the name is taken from digging and turning vp the earth with her nose & backe, according to the saying of Virgill : Aut oculis capti fodere cubilia Talpae. Some are of opinion, that it is called Talpa, bycause it is appointed to an euerlasting dark∣nesse in the earth; of which sort Isidorus writeth thus: Talpa dicta est eò quòd perpetua caeci∣tate tenebris damnata, est enim abs{que} oculis. It is called also in Greeke Indouros, and Siphneus, of Siphnon the earth, because it liueth in the earth, and turneth it vpward to make it hollow for passage. The like I might say of his other names, Ixliocha, and Orthoponticos, but this shall suffice for his name. Countries of Moles Aristotle. Aelianus. In Boeotia about the Champaignes called Orchomenius ager, there are the greatest store of Moles in the world, for by digging they vnder-myne all the fieldes, and yet in Lebadia another country of Boeotia, there are none at all, and if they be brought thither from any other place they wil neuer dig but die. Rodolphus, Oppianus, and Albertus affirme, Pliny. Generation of Moles that they are created of themselues of wet earth and raine▪water, for when the earth beginneth to putrifie, the Mole beginneth to take life. They are all for the most part of a blacke dusky colour, with rough, short, and smoth soft haire as wooll, and those haires which were whitest when they are young, are most glistering and perfect blacke when they are old: and Gesner affirmeth, that hee saw in the end of October, a Mole taken, which was very white, mixed with a little red, and the red was most of all vpon her belly, betwixt her forelegs and the necke, and that it could not be a young one, bycause it was two palmes in length betwixt his head and taile. These beasts are all blind and want eies, Blindnesse of Moles. and therefore came the prouerbe Talpa caecior Tuphloteros aspalacos, blinder then a Mole; to signifie, a man without all iudgment, wit, or fore-sight: for it is most elegantly applyed to the minde. Yet if any man looke earnestly vpon the places where the eies should grow, he shall perceiue a little passage, by drawing vp the membrane or little skinne which is black, and therefore ( Aristotle saith) of them in this manner probably. All kinds of Moles want their sight, because they haue not their eies open and naked as other beasts, but if a man pull vp the skinne of their browes about the place of their eies, which is thicke and shawdoweth their sight, he shal perceiue in them inward couered eies, for they haue the blacke circle, and the apple, which is contained therein, and ano∣ther part of the white circle or skinne, but not apparantly eminent; neither indeede can they, because nature at the time of generation is hindered, for from the braines there be∣long to the eies two stronge neruy passages, which are ended at the vpper teeth, and therefore their nature being hindered, it leaueth an imperfect worke of sight behinde her. Yet there is in this Beast a plaine and bald place of the skin where the eies should stand, hauing outwardly a little blacke spot like a Millet or Poppey-seede, fastened to a Nerue inwardly, by pressing it, there followeth a blacke humor or moystnesse, and by dissection of a Mole great with young, it is apparant (as hath beene prooued) that the young ones before birth haue eies, but after birth, liuing continually in the darke earth without light, Albertus they cease to grow to any perfection; for indeede they neede them not, because being out of the earth they cannot liue aboue an houre or two. Esope hath a pretty fable of the Asse, Ape, and Mole, each once complaining of others natural wants: the Asse, that he had no Hornes, and was therefore vnarmed: the Ape, that he had no taile like other beastes of his stature and quantity, and therefore was vnhandsome; to both which the Mole maketh aunswer, that they may well be silent, for that she wanteth eies, and so insi∣nuateth, that they which complaine shall find by consideration and comparision of their owne wantes to others, that they are happy and want nothing that were profitable for them. Oppianus saith, that there was one Phineus which was first depriued of his eie-sight, and afterward turned into a Mole: It should seeme he was condemned first to loose his eies, and afterward his life. Their seural parts & mem¦bers. These Moles haue no eares, and yet they heare in the earth more nimbly and perfectly then men can aboue the same, for at euery step or small noise and almost breathing, they are terrified and run away, & therfore (Pliny saith) that they vnderstand al speaches spoken of thēselues, & they hear much better vnder the earth then being aboue & out of the earth And for this cause they dig about their lodging long passages, which bringeth noises and voices to them, being spoken neuer so low and softly, like as the voice of a man carried in a trunke, reed, or hollow thing. Their snowt is not like a Weasils (as Suidas saith) but rather like a shrewe-mouses, or (if it be lawfull to compare small with great) like to a Hogges. Their teeth are like a shrews and a Dogges, like a shrewes in the neather teeth and furthermost inner teeth, which are sharpe pointed and lowe inwardly; and like a dogges, because they are long at the sides, although onely vpon the vpper-iaw, and therefore they are woorthily called by the Grae∣cians Marootatous ; that is, daungerous-biting-teeth, for as in swine the vnderteeth stand out aboue the vpper, and in Elephants and Moldes, the vpper hang ouer the neather, for which cause they are called Hyperphereis. The tong is no greater then the space or hollowe in the neather chap, and they haue in a manner as little voice as sight, and yet I marueile how the prouerbe came of Loquax Tal∣pa, a pratling mould, in a popular reproach against woordy and talkatiue persons, which Ammianus saith, was first of all applyed to one Iulianus Capella, after hee had so behaued himselfe, that he had lost the good opinion of all men. The necke seemeth to bee nothing, it is so short, standing equall with the forlegges. The lights are nothing else but distinguished and seperated Fibres, and hang not togither vpon any common root or beginning, and they are placed or seated with the hart, which they enclose, much lower toward the belly then in any other beast. Their gal is yellowish, their feet like a beares, and short legges, wherefore they moue and runne but slowly: their fingers or toes wherewithall they digge the earth, are armed with sharp nailes, and when she feeleth any harme vpon her backe, presently she turneth vpwarde and defendeth her selfe with her snowt and feet: Cardanus. with her feete she diggeth, and with her nose casteth awaye the earth, and therefore such earth is called in Germany mal werff, and in England Mole∣hill : and she loueth the fieldes, especially meddowes and Gardens, where the ground is soft, for it is admirable with what celerity she casteth vp the earth. They haue fiue toes with clawes vpon each forefoot, and foure vpon each foote bee∣hind, according to Albertus, but by diligent inspection you shall find fiue behind also, for there is one very little and recurued backward, which a man slightly and negligently loo∣king vpon, would take to be nothing. The palme of the forefeet is broad like a mans hand, and hath a hollow in it if it be put togither like a fist, and the toes or fingers with the nailes are greater then any other beast of that quantity. And to the end that he might be wel ar∣med to digge, the forepart of her forelegges consist of two solide and sound bones which are fastned to her shoulders, and her clawes spread abroad, not bending downewarde, and this is peculiar to this beast not competible to any other, but in her hinder legges boeth before and behind they are like a Mouses, except in the part beneath the knee, which con∣sisteth but of one bone which is also forked and twisted. The taile is short and hairy: And thus much for the anatomy and seuerall parts. the places of their abode They liue as we haue saide in the earth, and therfore Cardan saith, that there is no crea∣ture which hath blood and breath that liueth so long togithervnder the earth, and that the earth doth not hinder their exspiration and inspiration; for which cause they keepe it hol∣low aboue them, that at no time they may want breath, although they doe not heaue in two or three daies; but I rather beleeue when they heaue, they doe it more for meate then for breath, for by digging and remoouing the earth they take Wormes, and hunt after victuals. When the wormes are followed by Molds, (for by digging and heauing, they fore∣know their owne perdition) they flie to the superficies and very toppe of the earth, the sil∣ly beast knowing that the Molde their aduersary, dare not followe them into the light, so that their wit in flying their enemy is greater, then in turning againe when they are troade vpon. They loue also to eat Toads and Frogges (for Albertus saith) he saw a great Toade whose legge a Mole helde fast in the earth, and that the Toade made an exceeding great noise, crying out for hir life, during the time that the Molde did bite hir. And therefore Toads and frogs do eat dead Moles. They eat also the root of herbs and plants, for which cause they are called by Oppianus, poiophagi Herbiuorae, herbe-eaters. In the month of Iuly they come abroad out of the earth, Enemies to Moles. I thinke to seeke meate at that time when wormes be scanty. They are hunted by Weasels, and wilde Cats, for they will follow them into their holes and take them, but the Cats do not eate them: whereas wee haue said alreadye, that they haue an vnderstanding of mens speech when they heare them talke of them. Vnderstand∣ing of Moles I may adde thereunto a story of their vnderstanding, thus related by Gillius in his own experience and knowledge. When I had (saith he) put downe into the earth an earthen pot made of purpose with a narrow mouth to take Moles, it fortuned that within shorte space as a blind Mole came along shee fell into it and could not get forth againe, but lay therein whyning; one of her fellowes which followed her seeing his mate taken, heaued vp the earth aboue the pot, & with her nose cast in so much, til she had raised vp her com∣panion to the brim and was ready to come forth: by which in that blind creature confi∣ned to darknesse, doth not onely appeare a wonderfull worke of almighty God, that en∣doweth them with skill to defend, and wisely to prouide for their owne safety, but also planted in them such a naturall and mutuall loue one to another, which is so much the more admirable, considering their beginning or creation as we haue shewed already. Because by their continuall heauing and laboring for meate, they doe much harme to Gardens and other places of their aboad, and therefore in the husband-mans and house-wifes common-wealth it is an acceptable labor to take and destroy them. Taking of Moles For which cause it is good to obserue their passages, and marke the times of their comming to labor, which being perceiued they are easily turned out of the earth with a spade, and this was the first and most common way. Some haue placed a boord full of pikes which they fasten vppon a small sticke in the mole-hil or passage, and when the mole commeth to heaue vp the earth, by touching the sticke she bringeth down the pikes and sharp nailed board vpon her owne body and back. Other take a Wyar or yron, and make it to haue a very sharp point, which being fastened to a staffe and put into the earth where the Moles passage is, they bend and so set vp that when the Mole commeth along, the pike runneth into her and killeth her. The Graecians (saith Palladius ) did destroy and driue away their Moles by this inuen∣tion, they tooke a great Nut, or any other kind of fruit of that quantity, receipte, and so∣lidity, wherein they included chaffe, Brimstone, and Wax, then did they stop al the brea∣thing places of the Moles, except one at the mouth, wherein they set this deuise on fire, so as the smoke was driuen inwarde, wherewithall they filled the hole and the place of their walkes, and so stopping it, the Moles were either killed or driuen away. Also Paxamus sheweth another meanes to driue away and take Molles: If you take white Hellebor, and the rindes of wilde Mercury instead of Hemlocke, and dry them and beate them to poulder, afterward sifte them and mixe them with meale and with Milke beaten with the white of an Egge, and so make it into little morsels or bals, Paramus. and lay them in the Mole-hole and passages, it will kill them if they eate thereof, as they will certainely doe. Many vse to kill both Moles and Emmets with the froath of new Oyle, And to conclude, by setting an earthen pot in the earth and Brimstone burning therein, it will certainely driue them for euer from that place. Vnto which I may adde a superstitious conceite of an obscure Author, who writeth, that if you whet a mowing syth in a fielde or meddow vp∣on the feast day of Christs natiuity, (commonly called Christmas day) all the molles that are within the hearing thereof, will certainly for euer forsake that fielde, meddow or Gar∣den. With the skinnes of moles are purses made, for the rough and soft haire, Vse theyr seueral parts. and also blacke russet colour is very delectable. Pliny hath a strange saying, which is this; Epelli∣bus talparum cubicularia vidimus stragula; adeò ne religio quidem a portentis summouet de∣licias, that is, we haue seene the hanginges of chambers made of mole skinnes, so that no conscience of religion cannot auert the monstrous loue of delights from the afectation of men. For all the auncient Wise-men and magicians did hold, that this beast was capeable of Religion, Nullis ae{que} credunt extis; nullum Religionis capacius iudicant animal, vt si quis cor eius recens palpitans{que} deuorarit diuinationis & rerū efficiendarum euentus promittat, they giue not so much credit to any intrals as to theirs, for they iudge that no beast is so capa∣ble of Religion, because if a man eat the heart of a Mole newly taken out of her belly and panting, he shall be able to deuine and fortell infalliable euents. Another saith, Veteribus monumentis traditur Gallinaceorum fibris maximè dijs gratas videri: sicut Talparum viscera Magi verissima dicunt, Alex. ab alex illis{que} haud secus quam solenni victima litari, haec enim sunt exta argu∣tissima, in quibus diuina mens in esse creditur: that is. The Fibres of Cockes were woont a∣mong auncient monuments to be accounted most acceptable to the Goddes, euen as the bowels of Moles (as the wise men say) and to offer these as a most solemn sacrifice grate∣full to the Goddes, and that in those intrals it was beleeued that the minde and pleasure of God was seated and engrauen; and a litle after he saith, that the bowels of Moles and frogs do fortell many great and fortunate euents. But I will leaue this paganisme, and let it neuer enter into the hart of a reasonable man that such beasts can loue religion, or that God hath planted in their bowels and corrupt parts, such letters of his wisedome and fore-knowledge which he hath not granted to the immortall and incorruptible soule of man. Onely this I find by experience, that before any raine and change of weather, these silly beasts heaue vp the earth more aboundant∣ly then at other times, and that in Thessaly (as Varro saith) a whole Towne was once vnder∣mined by Moles. They were wont to sacrifice this beast to Neptune, because of the affini∣ty betwixt their names, for in Greeke Asphaloos signifieth Neptune, and Asphalax a mole. Alunnus also writeth that they were sacred and dedicated to hell, because they kept con∣tinually vvithin the bosome and bowels of the earth, and to conclude, because that moles would not liue in Coronea a part of Boeotia before spoken of, and thereof came the com∣mon prouerbe Asphalaca eis Coronean, a mole is brought to Coronea, to signifie the hatred of a gift or ghest to him that is forced to receiue him. Thus much for his natural and mo∣rall story, now followeth his medicinall. The medicines of the Mole. There is nothing which is more profitable or medicinable for the curing of the bites of a shrew, then a mole being flead and clapped thereunto. The same doth also very effe∣ctually cure and heale the blowes or bitings of a Scorpion. Pilles being made with that which proceedeth from moles and with Hony, Pliny eaten nine daies together, doth preserue the body of any one from swellings or bunches in the flesh who shall so eat them. For the auoiding or driuing away the haires which growe in any part of mans bodie, that they may neuer returne or be renewed againe: take a mole and laie her in water to be steeped or soaked, Arnoldus so long as she shal not haue any haires left vppon her, with this water annoint the place which is full of hairs, and afterwards wash it with lye made of ashes, and then rub it with a linnen cloath; then if you shall see the haires to returne againe, wash it twice or thrice in the aforesaid manner, and they wilbe quite expelled away, and by no meanes can be made eyther to renew or come againe. For the renewing, and bringing againe of those haires which are fallen or decayed, take a mole and burne her whole in the skin, and min∣gle the dust or pouder which commeth from the same with hony vnto the thickenesse or fashion of an ointment, Furnerius and this being rubbed or annointed vpon the bare or bald place will without dout in some short time or space procure the haire to grow thick. For the re∣newing of haires which fall from horses. Rus ius. Take a mole and boile her in Oyle, vntill all the flesh be consumed and quite dissolued into a liquid iuice, with this oyle annoint the place which is bare or destitute of haires twice euery day for some short space, and it will make the haires to grow in great abundance. For the changing of the haires of horses from blacke to white, take a mole and boile her in salt Water, or lye made of ashes three dayes together, and when the Water or lye shall be quite consumed, put new water or lie thereunto: this being done, wash or bathe the place with the water or lye somewhat hot; presently the black haires will fall and slide away, and in some short time there will come white. Whosoeuer shall take a mole and hold her in his right hand vntill she die, shall haue such an excellent vertue therein, that she shal ease the paine of a womans breasts onely by touching them. The dust of a mole being brent, mingled with the white of an Egge, and anointed vp∣on a sneepe, is an excellent and medicinable remedy against the Leprie which commeth oftentimes vpon them. The dust of a mole mixed with oyle or hony, Pliny. and annointed vpon the skin of either man or woman which is ful of Lepry, wil verie speedily and effectually cure and heale the same. The same being vsed in the aforesaide manner, is very good for the curing of those which are troubled with the disease called the Kinges euill, as also for those which haue hard bunches or kernels arising in their Arme-holes, Marcellus and in other parts of their body. The whole body of a mole being taken and burned in the skin into drye dust, or pou∣per, is an excellent remedy against the disease called the Fistula, as also for the purging of the corruption in them and healing of them, being once taking by any man. The same being also mixed with hony, and rubd vpon the teeth of any one who hath paine in them doth not onely ease the paine and greefe thereof, but also doth strengthen and make them fast. The blood of a mole being killed, Vincentius spred or annointed vpon the head of any one which is bald, wil very speedily renew and bring the haires againe. The head of a mole being cut off and beaten together with the earth which is stirred vp by moles, and wrought into a paast, and rowled togither like a little loafe, is very much vsed for the healing of al swel∣lings, and for those things which they cal impostumes, Sextus as also for al swellings or kernels which arise in the necke, so that in the time of the curing of these things, the party which is pained and greeued, be not suffered to eat any swines flesh. The tooth of a liuing mole taken out and tyed or bound to the teeth of any who is gri∣ued therein, Obscurus is commended by the Magi or wise-men to be an excellent remedy and cure for the same. The hart of a mole being eaten nine dayes together, doth very speedily and effectually cure either him or her which shal so eat it, of that pestiferous disease cald the Kings euil, if it be so that it hath not bene of too long continuance with them. Pliny. Arnoldus The same is also very good and profitable for the asswaging of Wens, being vsed in the aforesaide manner. The liuer of a mole being beaten betweene the handes of him that is troubled with bunches or swellings in his back, and afterwards put vpon the same, is a present help and cure. The same effect hath the right foot of a mole for the asswaging of bunches and swellings arising in the flesh. Of the vulgar little Mouse. A S we haue handled the natures, and deliuered the figures of the great Beasts, so also must we not disdaine in a perfect Hy∣story to touch the smallest: For Almighty God which hath made them al, hath disseminated in euery kind both of great and smal beasts, seeds of his wisedome, maiesty, and glory. Definition of a Mouse The little mouse therefore is iustly tearmed Incola domus no∣strae, an inhabitant in our own houses, Et rosor omnium rerum, and a knawer of al things. And therefore from the sounde of her teeth which she maketh in gnawing, shee is called Serex. Although we shal shew you afterwards, that Sorex is a speci∣all kinde, and not the name of the general. Wherefore seeing there be many kindes of Mise, and euery one of them desireth a particular tractate, I thought good to begin with the vulgar little mouse, and so to discend to the seuerall species and kindes of all, The seueral names. accor∣ding to the method of the Phylosopher, A notioribus minus ad nota, from things that are most knowne to them that are lesse knowne. In Haebrew it is called Achar, Leuit xi. where the Septuagintes translate it muys, the Chaldee Acbera, the Arabians Fer, or Phar, from whence commeth the Sarasan word Fara. The Persians An Mus, the Latins mus, the Italians Tapo, or Sorice, Alsorgio, O Rato, Di-Casa, although Rato signifieth a Rat, both among the Germans, French, and English. The Spaniards call the little Mouse, Ratt ; and the great Rat Ratz, the French the little Mouse Souris, which word seemes to be deriued from the Latine Sorex, and the great mouse they call Ratt. The Germaines the great ones Ratz, and the little one Muss, the Illyrians, and Pollonians, Myss, which is the Greek word, and the great one they cal Sczurcz, the Venetians cal the Rat Pantegana, of Pontis, the vulgar greekename, and the Romans Sourco. Denominati¦on of sundrie creatures frō the Mouse. Now the dignity of this little beast, may appeare by the name, which hath spred it selfe both to beasts, fishes, men, hearbs and Citties. To beasts as we haue shewed before in the Ichneumon, which is vulgarly called the Indian -mouse, or Pharoes -mouse. And to fishes, for there is a little fishe called Musculus, and in Greeke Mystocetos, the Whale-mouse, because it leadeth the way, and sheweth the Whale whether so euer shee swimmeth, for the auoiding of rockes, (according to Pliny ) although Rondoletius affirmeth otherwise, namely, that that guide of the Whale is called Egemon, and Egetur, and Mystocetus (hee saith) is a shell fish. Generally most kind of Oysters are also called Myss, because some∣times they gape and make a noise like a mouse, and close their shels againe. The purple Fishes be also called Myss, there is likewise a kind of pretious stone called Mya, about Bos∣phoras, Thrasius, and many such other dignities, hath the name of this beast attained. Pausanias. There was one Mys, the seruaunt of that famous Phylosopher Epicurus, likewise the name of a champion or chalenger, is Suidas and Varinus, and there was another called Mus, of excellent skill, for ingrauing in Siluer, and therefore did draw vpon the shield of Minerua, the fight betwixt the Lapithae, and the Centaurs, and many other things. Where∣upon martiall made this verse: Quis labor in Phyala? docti myos? anne myronis. There was a Consull of Rome, whose name was Mus, and therefore Camerarius made this riddle of the mouse; Parua mihi domus est, sedianua semper aperta, acciduo sumptu, furti viuo sagina, quod mihi nomen in est, Romae quo{que} Consul habebat. The Thrasians cald Argilus a mouse, and the citty which he builded Argelus. Myes was a citty of Ionia, and a cittizen of that citty was called Myetius. Myon a citty of Locri in Epirus, and the people thereof are called Myones. Myonesus a little region betwixt Teon and Lebedon, and acording to Stepha∣nus, an Island neare Ephesus, the first port or hauen of Egypt opening to the red sea, is cal∣led Muos armos, the mouses hauen, and Mysia also seemeth to be deriued from their stem. There is an Island vnder the Equinoctiall line, called Insula murium, the mouse-Ilande, because of the abundance of myce therein: and to conclude, euen the hearbs and plants of the earth, Theuetus. haue receiued names from this litle beast, as Hordeum Murinum, Myacantha, Sperrage, Myopteton, Myuoos, Myortocon Mouse-eare, Mouse-foot, and such like. There haue bin also commedies made of Myss, as that of Carsinus, called Myes, wherein the Weasill strangleth the night-wandring Myss. And another Greeke comedy called Galeomyoma∣chia, that is a fight betwixt cats and myce, wherein the poet doeth most pleasantly faine names of myce, as their king he called Creillus, that is a flesh-eater, and his eldest sonne Psicarpax, Fictions lear¦ned & wittie of the proper nams of Mise a corne-eater; and his second sonne Psitodarpes Bread-eater, and his eldeste daughter, Lycnogluphe, candle-eater, and all his auncestors Carpodaptai, that is Fruit-ea∣ters. And then he bringeth other myce in, as Turolicos, Psicolices, Cholecoclophos. Homer in his Batracomiomachia, that is, a fight betwixt Frogs and mice, doeth very elegantly de∣scribe diuers proper names of mice. As Piscarpax, whose father was Tuoxartes, and his mother Lychomile, daughter of Plernotrocta the king, and then other mice, as Lychopinax, Terogliphus, Embaschitrus, Lychenor, Troglodites, Artophagus, Ptermogliphus, Pternophagus, Cnissodioctes, Sidophogus, Artepibulus, Meridarpax, and Thulacotrox, all which are not on∣ly out of the aboundance of the Authors wit, but inuented for the expressing of the mou∣ses nature. The colour of Mice. The Epithets of myce are thes; short, small, fearful, peaceable, ridiculous, rustik, or coun∣try mouse, vrbane, or citty mouse, greedy, wary, vnhappy, harmefull, blacke, obsce , little, whiner, biter, and earthly mouse. And the Greeke ones are expressed before in the proper names, and thus much may suffice for the names of mice. Now to come to theyr seuerall nature and significations. First of all concerning their colour. It is diuers, for al∣though Color murinus be a common tearme for a mouse colour of Asses, yet notwithstan∣ding Scaliger. Albertus. Mice are sometimes blackish, sometimes white, sometims yellow, The quanti∣ty and seue∣rally parts of Mice. Mathoeolus. sometimes broune and sometimes ashe colour. There are White Mice amonge the people of Sauoy, and Dolphin in France called Alaubroges, which the inhabitants of the country do beleeu that they feede vpon snow. But the white Mouse is aboue all other most laciuious and leache∣rous, and therefore it came into a prouerbe, Myss Leucos, Myss Cacos, the white Mouse is an ill Mouse, of whose lust Alciatus made this emblem; Delitias & mollitiem, Mus creditur albus, Aristotle. Cicero. Arguere, at ratio good non sat aperta mihi est. An quod ei natura salax, & multa libido est? Ornat romanas, an quia pelliunrus? Sarmaticum, Murem vocitant pleri{que} zibellum. Of all which coniectures of the Poets, the first is most probable, for the auncientes were wont to call wanton, and effeminate men Pygargoy, and Leucopeugoy, from their beauty and whitenesse. And as there is a difference in their colours, so also there is in their quantity. For some are very great, some meanly great, and some very smal. Their hart is very great, and their liuer and lights encrease in the winter time. Also the fibres that are in them, doe increase and decrease with the waxing and wayning of the Moone. For euery day of the Moones age, there is a fibre increased in their liuer. And therefore Lucilius said well, Lu∣na alet ostrea, & implet echinos, Muribus fibras. That is to say. The Moone feedeth Oysters, filleth Hedghogs, and encreaseth fibres in Mice. Some of these Mice haue a gal, and some haue none, as Aristotle and Pliny shew in many places. The Mouses place of conception haue many holes in it, during the time s e b ar h hir young ones. There is no creature that heareth more perfectly then a Mouse, they dwell in houses of men, especially neare supping and dyning roomes, kitchins or larders, Albertus, where any meat is stirring. And they make themselues places of aboade by gnawing with their teeth, if they finde not conuenient lodginges prepared to their hand, Orus. Aelianus. and they loue the hollow places of wals, or the roofes of houses, and therefore the Waspes which in Aristo∣phanes are called Drophae, that is gnawers of roofes, are to be vnderstood to bee Mice, be∣cause Myss Drophia is a Mouse in the house top. In the day time they lye still, so long as they either see or heare a man, or any other beast harmeful vnto them, for they discerne their enemies, not fearing an Oxe, though they run away from a Cat. They are very desirous of bread, and delight in all those meats which are made of fruit, for the nourishment of men. It is a creature very diligent & exquisite, both to compasse, seeke out and chuse the same, so that therefore it doth often endanger and loose his owne life: and finding any cubbards, wood, or such like hard matter, to withstand his purpose, and hinder his passage, it ceaseth not to weary it selfe with gnawing, vntill it obtaine the purpose. All kinds of Mice loue grain and corne, and prefer the hard before the soft, they loue also cheese, and if they come to many cheeses together they tast all, but they eate of the best. And therefore the Egyptians in their Hyrogliphicks do picture a mouse, to signifie a sound iudgement and good choice. Buckmast is very acceptable to Mice, and the Mice in the Ile Parus, in Teredos, in the Iland Giaros, which is one of the Ilands of the Sporads in Cyprus, and in Calcis, they did eat yron, as appeareth by Aristotle, Aelianus, and Heraclides. And it was also found, that in a certain Iland neare Calybes, Mice eate and deuoure gold, and therefore the Gold-smiths did cut them in pieces among their mettles. Plutarch, in the life of Marcellus saith, that there were many prodigies and fearful signes that did pro∣ceede the war of Marius, amongst other he saith that mice did eate the Gold hanging in the temple, and that one of the temple keepers in a certaine trap tooke a female mouse a∣liue, who littered fiue little mice in that place, and deuoured three of them. Anthologius rehearseth a witty exasticon of Antiphilus, vpon a mouse which was slit asunder aliue, for certaine gold-dust, which shee had deuoured, whereby was signified how men procure vnto themselues exquisite torments, Pliny. Albertus. and vnauoidable mortall harmes by stealing, and encreasing of riches signified by Gold. Vulgar Mice do ruminate or chew the cud as well as the Pontix, and they drinke by licking or lapping, although their teeth be not sawed. It is reported that the mice of Affricke, Mice cannot drinke with∣out danger. and especially of Libia die assoone as they drinke. And the reason whereof we will shew afterwards in the taking of mice, when we come to discourse of their poysons. And for the present it should seeme their temperament, or constitution is so moyst that nature can endure no addition. Yet in the plaines of Arcadia there are Myce which drinke of a certaine fountains without any harme. Theophrastus Generation of mice and their carnall copulation. The generation or procreation of Myce, is not onely by copulation, but also nature worketh wonderfully in engendering them by earth and small showers, as we will shew in the discourse of wilde Mice. But the house-Mouse whereof we now entreat, is engendered by copulation betwixt male and female, and they are in generall most libidenous, as may appeare by that saying of Crattinus against Xenophon, Phere nun ex aithrias Katapuposunen muos astrapso Xenophon∣tos, go to now, for from the skies I wil strike by lightning the Murin wantonnesse of Xeno∣phon, and the female is much more venerious then the male, as appeareth by that fable of Ipicrates describing the rage of a lustfull Woman. Postremo subijt me, detestabilis lena deierans, per dianam, per puellam, per persephattam, se esse vittulam, esse virginem, esse pullam indomitam, at illa myonia erat. Then followed me that detestable band, swearing by Dia∣na and Persephatta that she was a Heighfar neuer touched, a Virgin neuer stained, and a Colt neuer couered, but the truth is she was as good a mayde as a Mouse. Politianus in∣stead of, at illa myonia erat, hath, at illa canus erat Murinus : that is, she was a Mouses hole, signifieng that her virginnity was lost, and that she suffered any louers as a Mouse-hole doth any Mice. And from hence came that verse of Martiall, describing the speach of a louer to his loue, calling him her Mouse and her ioy; Nam cum me Murim tu cum mea lumina dicis. So that ingenerall all mice, Albertus. Copulation of mice. and not onely the white Mouse are most desirous of copula∣tion. And when they are in copulation, they embrace with their tailes, filling one another without al delay. By tasting of salt, they are made very fruitefull, and therefore Aristotle, and the souldiors of Alexander the great do report, that mice by licking one another, and by the licking of salt do ingender and conceiue with yong without any other copulation. But what reasons they haue to lead them to that opinion, I know not, beside that wonder reported by Pliny and Aristotle, that in a certaine part of Persia, a female mouse being slit assunder aliue, all the young females within her belly are also found pregnant conceiued with young. Two myra∣cles in their procreation and multipli¦cation. It is very certaine, that for the time they go with yong, and for the number they bring forth, they exceed all other beasts, conceiuing euery fourteene or sixteene daies, so that it hath beene found by good experience, that a female mouse hauing free liberty to litter, in a vessell of millet-seede, within lesse compasse then halfe a year, she hath brought forth one hundred and twenty young ones. They liue very long, if they be not preuented of their naturall course, and dying natu∣rally, Ʋolateranus Gillius. whether mice be do∣cible. they perish not al at once, but by little, and little, first one member, and then ano∣ther, (Pliny saith) Euolucribus, hirundines sunt indociles, è terrestribus Mures, amonge the Fowles of the ayre, the swallowes are vndocible, and among the creatures of the earth a mouse; yet Albertus writeth, that he saw in vpper Germany, a mouse hold a burning can∣dle in her feet, at the commaundement of her maister all the time his guests were at Sup∣per. Now the onely cause why they growe not tame is, their naturall feare, such as is in Conies, Hares, and Deere. For how can any man or beast loue or harken vnto him, who they are perswaded lyeth in waight for their life, and such is the peswasion of all them that feare, which perswasion being once remoued by continual familiarity, there is no cause in nature but that a Mouse may be docible as well as a Hare or Cony, which we haue shewed heretofore in their stories. It is also very certaine that Mice which liue in a house, if they perceiue by the age of it, Presages and for knoledge of mice. it be ready to fall downe or subiect to any other ruin, they foreknow it and depart out of it, as may appeare by this notable story which happened in a towne called Helice in Greece, wherein the inhabitantes committed this abominable acte against their neighbours the Greekes. For they slew them and sacrificed them vpon their altars. Whereupon follo∣wed the ruin of the citty, which was premonstrated by this prodigious euent. For 5. daies before the destruction thereof, all the Mice, Weasels, and Serpentes, and other reptile creatures, went out of the same in the presence of the inhabitants, euery one assembling to his owne ranke and company, where at the people wondered much, for they cold not conceiue any true cause of their departure, and no maruaile. For God which had appoin∣ted to take vengance on them for their wickednes, did not giue them so much knowledge nor make them so wise as the beasts to auoid his iudgement, and their owne destruction; and therefore marke what followed. For these beasts were no sooner out of the citty, but suddenly in the night time, came such a lamentable earth-quake and strong tempest, that all the houses did not onely fall down, and not one of them stood vpright, to the slaughter of men, women, and children, contained in them, but least any of them should escape the strokes of the timber and house tops, God sent also such a great floud of waters, by rea∣son of the tempestuous wind which droue the Waters out of the sea vpon the Town, that swept them al away, leauing no more behind then naked and bare significations of former buildings. And not only the citty and Cittizens perished, Aelianus. but also there was ten ships of the Lace∣demonians in their port all drowned at that instant. The wisedome of the Mouse apeareth in the prepararion of her house, for considering shee hath many enemies, Their natu∣ral wisdome. and therefore many means to be hunted from place to place, she commiteth not herselfe to one lodg∣ing alone, but prouideth many holes; so that when she is hunted in one place shee may more safely repose her selfe in another. Which thing Plautus expresseth in these wordes. Sed tamem cogitato, Mus pusillus, quam sapiens sit bestia, aetatem qui vni cubili, nunquam com∣mittit suam: cum vnum obsidetor, aliunde perfugium quaerit, that is to say, it is good to con∣sider the little mouse, how wise a beast she is, for she will not commit her life to one lodg∣ing but prouideth many harbors, that being molested in one place she may haue another refuge to fly vnto. And as their wisedome is admirable in this prouision, so also is their loue to be com∣mended one to another, for falling into a vessell of Water or other deepe thing, Their natu∣ral loue to one another. out of which they cannot ascend againe of themselues, they help one another, by letting downe their tailes, and if their tailes be to short, then they lengthen them by this meanes, they take one anothers taile in their mouth, and so hang two or 3. in length vntill the Mouse which was fallen downe take hold on the neathermost, which being performed, they al of them draw her out. Euen so Wolues holding one another by their tailes, do swim ouer great riuers, and thus hath nature graunted that to them which is denyed to many men, Aelianus. Their dispo¦sition and their flesh. Proc p s. Aristeas. namely to loue, and to be wise both together. But concerning their maners, they are euil, apt to steale, incideous, and deceitefull, and men also which are of the same disposition with these beasts fearing to do any thing publikely, & yet priuatly enterprise many deceits are iustly reproued in imitation of such beasts. For this cause was it forbidden in gods law vnto the Iewes, not only to eat, but to touch mice, & the prophet Esa. ch. 66 saith, Come∣dentes carnem suillā, & abominationem, at{que} murem simul consumentur inquit Dominus, that is they which eat swins flesh, abomination, & the Mous shalbe destroyed together saith the Lord: wherein the prophet threatneth a curse vnto the people, Arnaldus. that broke the first law of God, in eating flesh forbidden, and the Physitians also say, that the eating of the flesh of Mice engendereth forgetfulnesse, abomination, and corruption in the stomacke. The eating of bread or other meate which is bitten by Mice doth encrease in men and children a certaine disease in their face, hu t by mice to the bodies of mankinde. and in the flesh, at the rootes of the nails of their fingers certaine hard bunches, called by the Venetians Spelli, and by the Germans Leid∣spyssen, and by the Latins Dentes Muris: yet it is affirmed, that the flesh of Mice is good for Haukes, to be giuen them euery day, or euery each other day together with the skin, for it helpeth their entrals, purgeth fleame, and choller, restraineth the fluctions of the belly, Medicine of Hawkes. Demetrius. driueth out stones and grauell, stayeth the distillation of the head to the eyes, and finall corroborateth the stomacke. Yet we haue hard that in the kingdome of Calechut, they do eate Mice and Fishes roasted in the sun. And it is said by some Physitians and Ma∣gicians, that the flesh is good against melancholy, and the paine of the teeth, but the me∣dicinall vertues we reserue to his proper place. Pliny affirmeth a strange wonder, worthy to bee remembred and recorded, Eating of Mice. that when Hanniball besieged Casselinum, there was a man that sold a Mouse for two hundred pieces of quoine, so great was the extremity of famine, that the man which sold it dyed for hunger, and as it should seeme through the want of it, but he which bought it liued by eating therof, the which thing argueth that ne∣cessity, hunger, and famin, maketh men for the safegard of life, to make more reckoning in extremity of the basest creaturs, then in prosperity they do of the best. For that person which gaue so much mony for a Mouse, at another time woulde haue scorned to haue gi∣uen so much for foure Oxen. And on the other side the wretched loue of gaine, which causeth a man to endanger his owne life for loue of siluer. But I rather thinke that it was the hand of God himselfe taking vengance of such a couetous disposition which would not suffer him to liue, that like Mi∣das had gotten so much gold. Enemies of Mice. The enemies of Mice are many, not onely men which by sundry artificiall deuises kill them because of harme, but also beasts and wilde foule doe eat their flesh, and liue vpon them. And first of all Cats & Weasels, do principally hunt to catch Mice, and haue bin therefore by the late writers called Murilegi, for their taking of Mice. And the nature of the Weasell is not onely more enclined to hunt after them, then the cat, but is more terri∣ble also vnto them, Pliny. for if the braines of a Weasell, the haire or rennet be sprinkled vppon Cheese or any other meate whereto Mice resort, they not onely forbeare to eate thereof, but also to come in that place. They are also driuen away by the sprinkling of the ashes of Weasels, and as all noises make them afraid, so none so much as the skreetching or crying of a weasell, for at the hea∣ring thereof they fall astonished. And besides they haue more opportunity to follow and take them then cats, because their bodies are lesser, and their noses and snouts longer, and therefore they follow them many times into their holes, and very nimbly pul them forth when they thinke they are most secure. Foxes also kill Mice, and in Italy there is a blacke Snake called Carbonario from his colour resembling coales, which I thinke to be the same that the Gretians call Myagros, from his hunting of Mice: This snake doth also eat and de∣uoure Mice. Haukes eate Mice, and all the night-birds, especially the night-crowes and Owles. How hatefull a Mouse is to the Elephant, wee haue shewed already in that story, how in the presence thereof he will not touch his meate, nor eate any thing ouer which a Mouse doth run. Nor yet eate in the cratch or manger wherein a Mouse hath bin. Ponzet∣tus affirmeth, that there is great loue betweene Mice and Serpentes, for sometimes they play together. Their is a hatred betwixt Bats, Frogs, and Mice, as may appeare by Anthologius, Museus, and others. It is said also that they are hatefull to Oysters, whereof I know no reason, ex∣cept it be because they loue their fish. And Alciatus hath a pretty embleme, which he en∣tituleth Captinus ob gulam, wherein he sheweth, that a Mouse watcheth an Oyster when he gapeth, and seeing it open thrust in his head to eate the fish, assoone as euer the Oyster felt his teeth, presently he closeth his shell again, and so crusheth the mouses head in pie∣ces, whereby hee disciphereth the condition of those men which destroy themselues to serue their belies, And thus much for the loue and enmity betwixt Mice and other beasts. Now concerning the actions of men, they hunt Mice to be rid from their anoyances, be∣cause they do not onely destroy the things they eate, and liue vpon other mens cost, and therefore Parasites are compared vnto them whom the Germans call Schmorotzer, and Tellerlecker, that is smell-feasts, and lick-spickets, are compared to Mice, because they liue at other mens tables. But also Mice do defile, corrupt, and make vnprofitable what∣soeuer they tast, and therefore the Egyptians, when they would describe corruption, do picture a Mouse For these causes haue men inuented many deuises, snars, and gins, the generall wherof is called by the Latines Muscipula, and by the Gretians Muspala, and Miagra, the diuers and seuerall formes whereof I will not disdaine to set down. For the wise reader must con∣sider that it is as necessary or rather more necessary for most men to know how to take mice, then how to take Elephants. And although every woman, and silly Rat-ketcher can giue instruction enough therin, yet their knowledge cannot excuse my negligence if I should omit the inuentions and deuises of the auncient, whereby they deliuerd themselues from the annoiances of these beasts. And therefore first of al to declare the manner of ketching them in places where corne is kept: Let your moustrap bee placed to ketch mice, right against the door, but let them haue roome to come in, and in short time it will so feare them, that they wil trouble you no more. But if mice breed in the ground vnder creaueses, except you fill al the crea∣uises with moustraps, you wil neuer ketch them, which the inhabitants of the Iland Panda∣tharia are faine to do. There are other kind of moustraps which do ketch mice aliue: Varrus. and othersome which do kil them, either being pressed downe with the waight of it, or stifeld with water, or other∣wise, as with a stronge piece of yron being smal, and hung right against the butten of the trap, on the which piece of iron they hang meate, and so by that meanes the mouse is ket∣ched by putting her head through the hole to snatch at the meate, for she by stirring the iron doth losen the butten, and so her heade is shut fast in the hole. And there are other kind of moustraps which are couered al ouer, into the which the mouse may run, & if you haue put any water therein they are presently stifeled. Of al which kind of traps shall be se∣uerally tracted: And first of all of those which do ketch mice aliue. The common kind of this moustrap is made of wood, long and foure cornerwise, and is framed of foure boards, but the hinder part is strengthned with strong wiers of iron, that she may without any danger looke in to see what shee may get there, and that the smell of the which she findeth ther, may alure hir to come to it. And the former part hath a hole in the top, through which there is put a small peece of yron, and also there is made a trap∣door in form of a percullis, to the which the iron is very slightly hung, that when the mous commeth to ketch at the meat she is suddenly taken by falling of the same; but the meat which you fasten to the neather end of this iron hook must be fat, or the crust of cheese or bread, which if it be a little toasted at the fire it wil not be amisse, that the mouse may smell it far off. Some do make these kind of traps doble, with one doore at one end, and another doore at another end. These kind of moustraps Peterus Crescent : doth cal traps belonging to houses, which shal be spoken of hereafter. The other kind of moustrap is made with iron hookes hung in the round circle. In the middest of the which brim is put a great many of the same wiers, which being made sharp at euery end are after the forme of the top of a crest, or helmet, or as it is made in a bow∣net to ketch fishes, and vpon the hooke let their be hung meate, by the which meanes the mouse comming to the meat, sticketh her selfe vpon the hookes. The manner of making lesser moustraps is with Walnut tree, and that the middle part of it bee not couered, and that there be put to the mouth or brim thereof some kind of mettle, so that the open part may bend inward, and that the mouse may not gnaw that which is within except she cree∣peth vnder: which if shee shall do, she shall presently be shut in by stirring the trap. Also there is another kind of moustrap which is couered with the barke of a tree, which is cut into equall pieces, and laid crosse one ouer another, Crescentient but there is tied a swines skinne in the middle, and also an earthen pot couered with the same barke being first sprinkled with corne that the Mice may custome to come to it, and being dryed with lying they breake in pieces, but you must lay them together againe, and fill your pot with Water, by the which meanes assoone as euer they are vppon the same they fall into the pyt, and so are stifeled. And also it is reported of those which haue tryed the same, that if Mice fall into a ves∣sell without water, and remaine there a long time without meate, that then they deuoure one another, but if they remaine there so long vntill one among them all be left alone, that is to say the strongest of them all, and that he be suffered to go out, wheresoeuer hee shall finde any mice hee will eate them vp, and they shall haue much adoe to escape him, because he hath been so long accustomed vnto them. I was told also of a certaine friend of mine, that a man of Senensis did set a purse in a hollow place, and made it to open and shut by some deuise, so that at length he tooke a mouse, which mouse hee fed onely with the flesh of Mice, and after he had fed it so a long time, he let it go, who killed all the Mice that he did meete, and was not satisfied with them, but went into euery hole that he could find, and eat them vp also. Also Mice are taken in vessels, from whence they canot escape, vpon the which vessell let there be put a small staffe, which is so cut in the middle, that she may onely hold her selfe by the meate, and when you haue so doone, put the kernell of a Nut vpon the middle of the staffe, to the which the Mouse comming, doth fall into the vessell with the staffe, Crescentien. and they will be stifeled if their be any Water: but if there be none she will be killed. And againe he telleth of another manner of ketching of mice, which is as great as the first, and it is after this manner. Take two smooth boardes about the length of thy arme, and in breadth halfe thy Arme, but ioyne it so together that they may be distant from the lower part in length some foure fingers or little lesse, with two small spindles or clefts, which must be at euery end one, and fasten Paper vnder them, and put a peece of paast therin, being cut ouerthwart in the middle, but you must not fasten it nigh the mid∣dle, & let it be so bound that it may easily be lifted vp betwixt the spindles, that if by slip∣ping it should be altered, it migh be brought againe to the same forme. But the two spin∣dles spoken of before, ought to be ioyned together in the ends aboue, & beyond them an∣other smal spindle to be made, which may hold in the middle a crooked wedge or butten, vpon the which may be hanged a piece of Hogges skinne, so that one of them may easily be turned vpsided downe with the skinne, and put thereunto a little peece of earth or sticke, that the mice may easily come to it: So that how many myce soeuer shall come thereto, and to the meate, shall be taken, alwayes by rowling the Paper into his wonted place. There is another manner also, which is to make a round peece of Woode fastened on both sides with Needles, and made so that the hinder part of it way heauier then the for∣mer, and that it stand an inch hyer then the other, and then when you haue so placed it, throw some corne thereon, that the mice may be alluted thereto, and tie also a peece of flesh vpon the former end of it; and so the Mouse going into the middle, by the rouling off the same, slippeth into the kettle which standeth vnder it, which must bee halfe full of Water, the circle presently being as it was before, that very often many mice are ket∣ched in one night by this worke, Crescentien. all falling into the kettle. Also there are many kinds of mice-traps where mice do perish by the waight thereof, and they are made of a smal-piece of wood made hollow, into the which shall fal down another smal piece of Wood, but it must be made so that it may fall waighty to presse downe the mice going to the meat, and let the meat be tyed to another little small peece of wood, which being touched, the hea∣uy peece doth presently fall downe, and so by that meanes the mouse is taken. Our country men do make a trap which is somewhat like to this, let two peeces of boords be ioyned together one foot broad, and two foot long, and afterwards let there be put in them a wooden pin, which you must fasten to the lower boord, so that it may not touche the vppermost; and you must set it so that the former part may easily moue backewarde and forward, but moreouer the former boord must be fastened to the hinder, like the fa∣shion of a Gibbet or Gallowes, with two peeces of wood standing vpright, one being put ouerthwart, or after the fashion of the Greek letter, , and it must stand some nine yn∣ches high, & as broad as the boord wil suffer you, & let the meat be hung in the mid∣dle of it, but that boord which is vppermost, must touch both the ends of the other, and notched according to the bredth, the notch being made after the forme of a wedge de∣uided into two parts, and an other small peece of wood must be put to that which is vper∣most, almost two fingers long, and one finger broad, and let there bee put into the lower notch, a peece of wood with meat at it, so that it may be slightly fastened to the brimme of the vppermost, that the meate being presently touched, the other may the easiler fall. And you may lay a stone vpon the vppermost bord that it may fall the heauier. And there are some also which to the lower board, doe fasten iron pinnes, made very sharp, against the which the Mice are driuen by the waight of the fall. Furthermore, there is another kinde of trap made to couer them aliue, one part of it cut out of a small peece of woode, the length of the palme of thy hand, and the breadth of one finger, and let the other part of it be cut after the forme of a wedge: and let this peece of wood be erected like a little piller, and let the wedge be put into the notch of an other peece of wood, which must be made equall with the other, or very little shorter: and this piller must bee so made, that the mouse may not perish before she come to the meate: The wood where the meat must stand, ought to be a span long, and you must fasten the meate about the middle of it, but the former part of it must haue a cleft, which must begin a little from the brim, and shall be made almost the length of two fingers, and you must make it with two straight corners, and take away halfe the breadth of the wood. These three peeces of woode being thus made ready, thou shalt erect a little piller, so that the wedge may be downeward, whereby the mouse may see the meate euery where: and let the meate be hung in the former cor∣ner of the piller, so if the mouse shall touch the meate, he shall bee pressed downe with the fall of the board. Mice also by the fall of a cleft board are taken, which is held vp with a piller, and hauing a little spattular of wood, whereon the meate shall lye, so made that the piller doth not open being parted, except when the mouse commeth to touch the meate, and so by that meanes she is taken. There is also another manner of mouse-trap vsed among vs, which is, let there bee a hole made and compassed about with a boord of a foot long, and fiue or six fingers broad, the compasse whereof must be foure fingers, into this hole let there be put a vessell made of wood the length of ones fist, but round and very deepe: and in the middle of each side of this vessell let there be made a hole, wherein there is put in a thread made of yron with meat, and let it be compassed about with a small thread which must be fastned ouerthwart the hole: and the part of the thread which hangeth downe must be crooked, that the meat may be fastned thereto, and there must bee a peece of the thread without, to the which may be tyed a stronger peece of wood, which is the thread whereon the meat is hanged, by the which the mouse is taken, by putting her head into the vessel to ketch at the meat. And also mice are taken otherwise, with a great Cane wherein there is a knot, and in the top of it let there be made a little bow with a lute string, and there sticke a great needle in the middle of the pole of the Cane, and let the pole be made iust in the middle, and let there be bound a peece of flesh beneath, so prepared that when the mouse shall bite, and mooue the skin, that then the string slippeth downe, and so the needle pearceth through his head, and holdeth him that he cannot run away. But among all the rest there is an ex∣cellent peece of workmanship to ketch mice, which I will heer set down. Take a peece of wood, the length of both thy fists, one fistbroad, and two fingers thicke, and let there be cut off about some two fingers, a little beyond the middle of halfe the breadth. And that breadth where it was cut, ought to be more declining and lower, after the manner of this letter A. And you must put to the side of this a peece of wood, halfe a circle long, ben∣ding, and in the middle part of each side holes pearced through, so that the halfe circle may be streight and plainely placed to the foundation of the woode, that the trap being made, it may rest vpon the same halfe circle, and vpon this halfe circle let there be placed iron nailes very sharp, so that the instrument by falling downe may couer the irons of the halfe circle as soone as euer they touch the same, Furthermore there is another manner of trap, when a vessell out of which they cannot escape, is filled halfe vp with water, and vpon the top thereof Otmell is put, which will swim, and not sinke, making the vppermost face of the water to seeme white, and solid, whereunto when the mouse commeth, she leapeth into the oate-mell, and so is drowned: And the like may be done with chaffe mingled with oat-mell: and this in all traps must be obserued, wherein mice are taken aliue, that they be presently taken forth, for if they make water in the place, their fellowes will for euer suspect the trap, and neuer come neare t, till the sauour of the vrine be aholished. Palladius saith, that the thicke froth of oyle, being infused into a dish or brasen cal∣dron, and set in the middle of the house in the night time, will draw all the mice vnto it, wherein they shall sticke fast, and not be able to escape. Anatolius Pliny saith, that if a mouse be gelded aliue and so let go, she will driue away all the re∣sidue; but this is to be vnderstoode of the Sorex. If the head of a mouse be flaied, or if a male mouse be flaied all ouer, or her taile cut off, or if her legge be bound to a post in the house, or a bell be hung about her necke, and so turned going, she will driue away all her fellowes. And ( Pliny saith) that the smoke of the leaues of the Ewe-tree, because they are poyson, will kill mice, so also will libbards-baine, and henbaine-seede, and Wolfe baine, for which cause they are seuerally called Myoctonos, and the rootes of Wolfe bane, are commonly sold in Sauoy vnto the Country people for that purpose. In Germany they mingle it with oat-mell, and so lay it in bals to kill mice. The fume of wall-wort, calcauth, parcely, origanum, and deaths-hearb, doe also kill mice: you may also driue them away with the fume of the stone Haematites, and with greene tamarisk, with the hoofe of a mule, or of nitre, or the ashes of a Weasell, or a cat in water, or the gall of an Oxe put into bread. The seede of Cowcumbers being sod, and sprinckled vpon any thing, mice will ne∣uer touch it, likewise wilde coucumber and coloquintida, kill mice. To keepe mice from corne, make morter of the froth of oyle mingled together with chaffe, and let them well dry, and afterwards be wrought throughly, then plaster the wals of your garnery there∣with, and when they are dry cast more froth of oyle vpon them, and afterwards carry in your corne and the mice will neuer annoy it. Cato Wormewood laid among cloathes, and skinnes, defend them from mice,: And also the water of wormewood sod, sprinckled vpon cloathes hath the same operation. Tragus Inke tempered with water, wherein Wormewood hath beene washed, or sod, cau∣seth that the Parchment and Paper written therewith, shall neuer be eaten, or touched with mice. Auicen Anatolius and Tarentinus, in the discourse of the grauery or barm do write, that milk-thistle mingled with hony, water, and fine flower, or mil-dust, made into little balles, and laied where mice my eat of it, doth make them blind if they taste thereof. White Helle∣bore mixed with pottage, Paxausus or the seedes of wilde Cowcumber, Coloquintida, and meale, mingled with blacke Hellebore, and put into Cheese or bread, or any kind of fat meat, kil∣leth both Rats and mice. So likewise a white camelion sod in broth, mingled with water and oyle, killeth Dogges, swine, and mice. The iuyce of the roote of the hearbe Camelion, mixed with water and oyle, draweth mice vnto it, and killeth them by tasting thereof, if they drinke not presently: so also doth Henbane. The roots of the bramble Tree, mingled with Butter, Breade, or Honey, Ele∣campaine, and sea Onions, Scamoney, wild Sparradge, Arsenicke, Mug-wort, otherwise cald mouse-wort, mingled with Lard in small peeces, with Auri pigment, killeth Wolues and mice. Croscentien∣sis. and in some countries, for the better dispersing of the poyson, set drinke beside the same, whereof as soone as they tast they swel and die, but I haue seen them die without drinking at all. Mice and wolues if they tast of the wilde Rose, and drinke after it, doe not not onely dye, but also fall into madnesse and bite their fellows, communicating the qua∣lity of the disease to euery one they bite. Flesh cut into little peeces & fryed with butter in a frying pan, Cardon and afterwards when it is colde, adde halfe so much soft pitch thereto, and mingle t together, rowling vp the flesh in the pitch, then distribute it vpon little boords, and set it in the place, and places whereunto the mice do much resort, and water beside it, and when that they haue tasted of it a little, they are so eagerly a thirst, that they drinke and dye. The like I may say of Rats-bane, Quicke-siluer, Sublimate, and Precipitate, and diuers other thinges, and thus much may suffice, for the ketching, taking, and killing of myce, whereunto I may adde the vse of their members and parts, not medicinall, but naturall, although I haue touched it heeretoforein part. The Scythians were woont to be clad with the skinnes of mice and Wolues, and it is obserued, that when mice cry and screeketh aboue their ordinary custome, it presageth an alteration and change of the Weather, and thus much shall suffice for their naturall discourse. Hauing thus discoursed of the nature of the vulgar mouse, The morrall story of mice I may also adde the mor∣ral vse thereof, as I find it recorded among learned writers; deliuered eyther in Historie or in prouerbe. It is reported of Glaucus the sonne of Minos and Pasiphae, that while he fol∣lowed a mouse to take her, he fel into a vessel of hony, but after Polyades the prophet, by laying an herb on him raised him againe to life. Hatto an Arch▪Bysh. of Metz in the fron¦tiers of Germany, was destroyed by mise, or as other say by Rats, Tzetzes. but the words of Textor are: Hatto Archiepiscopus Moguntinus à muribus fertur deuoratus. And the error may proceed, because that Mus is a generall word for the Rat and mouse, and therefore they which haue thought it an vnreasonable thinge, that so small beastes should destroy so mighty a prince, haue rather attributed it to the Rats then to the mice; but they ought to haue rememberd, that it was an extraordinary iudgement of God to punish a cruell couetous wretch, and that therefore it was as easie for him to make the lit∣tle mouse his instrument, as the great Rat: for we read, that Herod was deuourd by worms, and other haue beene eaten vp with lyce. Adrian the Pope was strangled by a flye, and therefore Hatto an Archbishop might aswel perish through the afflicting hand of God by a multitude of mice. Heliogabalus that wretch, among other his monstrous desires, and Tyrannicall com∣maundes, Lampridius affirmeth, that vpon a time he commaunded that there should bee brought vnto him ten thousand mice aliue, a thousand weasils, and a thousand Sorices or wilde fielde-mice, so base were his thoughts, that while he should haue attended his Em∣periall calling, and hearkened to the suits and complaints of poore distressed subiects, he was busied in killing of mice, and therefore in ancient time, a mouse-killer was taken for an opprobrious speech, for a base, sluggish, and idle companion. The like is reported of a Moscouian Emperour, who to afflict his people and to ga∣ther money from them, commanded the Cittizens of Musco to bring him a pecke full of fleas, whereunto the people answered, that if they could take so many, yet could not they keepe them together from leaping away. And mice haue beene brought into publique spectacle, because at Lauinium they gnawed asunder the shields of siluer; and it was afterward iudged a prodigie, for there followed the Marsicke war. When the Scythians vnderstoode that Darius with his great army stoode in neede of vittailes, they sent vnto him a Prouant-master with these presents or gifts, a birde, a mouse, a frog, and fiue darts. At the receipte whereof the Persians wondered what should be meant thereby; and de∣maunded of the messenger the meaning of the mystery. But the Ambassador answered, he knew not any signification of his presents, but onely receiued charge to deliuer them, and make hast backe againe, and to bid the Persians if they were wise to lay their wits to∣gether to know and vnderstand the meaning thereof. When the Persians heard him say so, they fell to consultation. Darius gaue his opinion that the mouse, signified the earth, Herodotus. the frog, the waters, the bird, horses, and the darts warlike furniture and strength of for∣ces, and that the Scythians by sending all these vnto them, yeelded that the Persians should be Lords of their land, sea, horses and themselues, and that therefore they ought to be of good courage. But one Gobrias a graue Councellor who was one of the seuen that slew the Magi or Wizards aunswered otherwise, for his coniecture was more true, for said he, O persae, nisi effecti vt aues subuoletis in coelum, aut vt mures subeatis terram, aut vt ranae insiliatis in paludes, non remeabitis vnde venistis his sagittis confecti: O ye Persians, except ye become like birds to flye vp into heauen, or like mice to creepe into the earth, or like frogs to leap into the waters, you shall not returne back againe vnto the place from whence you came, and so indeede it came to passe. We reade 1. Sam. 5. that when the Arke of God was taken by the Philistimes, and they kept it in their Temple at Hazzah, the hand of the Lord fell vppon their Princes, and hee smote them with Emrods, in the bottome of their belly, that is, God punished them with mice, for he afflicted their bodies, and the fruites of the earth, for which cause Cap. 6. they aduise with themselues; to send back againe the Arke of the Lord with a present of Golden Mice. Ouid, Homer, and Orpheus call Apollo Smyntheus, for the Cretians in auncient time called Mice Smynthae : Now the fained cause thereof is thus related by Aelianus. There was one Crinis which was a Priest of Apollo : who neglected his dayly sacri∣fice, for the which through aboundance of mice he was depriued of the fruites of the earth, for they deuoured all. At which losse Apollo himselfe was moued; and taking pit∣tie of the miserie, appeared to one Horda a Neate-heard, commaunding him to tell Crinis that all the cause of that penury was for that he had omitted his accustomed sa∣crifice, and that it was his duetie to offer them againe diligently, or else it would be farre worse afterward. Crinis vpon the admonition amended the fault, and immediatly Apol∣lo killed all the deuouring Mice with his darts, whereuppon he was called Smyntheus. Other againe say, that among the Aeolians, at Troas & Hamaxitus, they worshiped mice and Apollo both together, and that vnder his Altar they had meate and nourishment, and also holes to liue in safely, and the reason was, because once many thousands of mice in∣uaded the corne fieldes of Aeolia and Troy, cutting downe the same before it was ripe, and also frustrating the husbandman of fruite and hope: this euill caused them to goe to Delphos to aske counsell at the Oracle what they should doe to be deliuered from that extremitie, where the Oracle gaue answere that they should goe sacrifice to Apollo Smyn∣theus, and afterward they had sacrificed, they were deliuered from the mice, and that therefore they placed a statue or figure of a mouse in the Temple of Apollo. When the Troyans came out of Creete, to seeke a habitation for themselues, they re∣ceaued an Oracle, that they should there dwell, where the inhabitants that were borne of the earth should set vpon them, the accomplishing whereof fell out about Hamaxitus, for in the night time, a great company of wilde mice, set vpon their bowes, quiuers, and strings, leathers of their bucklers, and all such soft instruments, whereby the people knew, that that was the place, wherein the Oracle had assigned them to build the Citty; & there∣fore there they builded Ida, so called after the name of Ida in Creete : and to conclude we doe reade that mice haue beene sacrificed, Sacrificing of Mice. Scoliast yco. for the Arcadians are said first of all to haue sacrificed to their Gods a mouse, and secondly a white horse, and lastly the leaues of an Oake. And to conclude, Aelianus telleth one strange storye of mice in Heraclea, that there is not one of them which toucheth any thing that is consecrated to Religion, or to the ser∣uice of their Goddes. Insomuch that they touch not their vines which are sacred to religi∣ous vses, but suffer them to come to their naturall maturitye, but depart out of they∣sland, to the entent that neither hunger nor folly cause them to touch that which is de∣dicated to deuine vses. And thus much for the naturall and morall story of the mice, now followeth the medicinall. The medicines of the Mouse. Albertus The flesh of a mouse is hot and and soft, and very little or nothing fat, and doth expell blacke and melancholy choler. A mouse being flead or hauing his skin pulled off, and af∣terwards cut through the middle, and put vnto a wound or sore wherein there is the head of a Dart or arrow, Marcellus or any other thing whatsoeuer within the wound, wil presently and ve∣ry easily exhale and draw them out of the same. Mice being cut and placed vnto woundes which haue beene bitten by Serpents, or put to places which are stinged by them, do very effectually and in short space of time cure and perfectly heale them. Mice which do lurke and enhabite in houses, being cut in twaine and put vnto the wounds which are new made by Scorpions, Dioscorides doth very speedily heale them. A yoong mouse being mingled with salt is an excellent remedy against the byting of the mouse called a shrew, which biting horses and labouring cattell, it doth venome vntill it come vnto the hart, and then they die, except the aforesaid remedie be vsed. Pliny The shrew also himselfe being bruised and laid vnto the place which was bitten, is an excellent and very profitable remedy against the same. A mouse being deuided and put or laid vpon warts, will heale them and quite abolish them, of what kinde soeuer they shall be. The fatte which is distilled from mice, Marcellus being mixed with a little goose-greace and boyled together, is an excellent and medicinable cure for the asswaging and mollifying of swellings and hard lumps or knots which doe vsually arise in the flesh. Yoong mice being beaten into small bits or peeces, Pliny and mixed with olde wine, and so boyled or baked, vntill they come vnto a temperate and mollify∣ing medicine, if it be annointed vppon the eye lids, it will very easily procure haire to grow thereon. The same being vnbeaten and roasted, and so giuen to little children to eate, will quickly dry vp the froath or spetle which aboundeth in their mouth. Dioscorides There are certaine of the wise men or Magi who thinke it good that a mouse should bee flead and giuen to those which are troubled with the tooth-ache twise in a moneth to be eaten. The water wherein a mouse hath beene sod or boyled, is very wholesome and profitable for those to drinke who a e troubled with the inflammation of the iawes or the disease cal∣led the Squincie. Mice, but especially those of Affricke, hauing their skinne puld off and well steeped in oyle and rubbed with salt, and so boyled, and afterwards taken in drinke, are very medicinable for those which haue any paine or trouble in their lightes & lungs. The same medicine vsed in the aforesaid manner is very profitable for those which are troubled with a filthy, mattery, and blooddy spetting out with retching. Pliny Sodden mice are exceeding good to restraine and hold in the vrine of infants or chil∣dren being too aboundant, if they be giuen in some pleasant or delightsome drinke. Mice being also cut in twaine, and laid vnto the feete or legs of those which are gowtie is an excellent remedie and cure for them. Mice being dryed and beaten to powder, doth ve∣ry effectually heale and cure those which are scalded or burned with hote water, or fire. Cypres nuts being burned and pounded, or beaten into dust, Marcellus and mixed with the dust of the hoofe of a male or female mule, being dryed or stamped small, and the oyle of mirtle added vnto the same, with the dirt or dung of mice being also beaten, and with the dung of a hedge-hogge new made, and with red arsenicke: and all mingled together with vi∣negar and moist or liquid pitch and put vnto the heade of any one who is troubled with the aboundance and loose hanging downe or ouergrowing of his haire, it will very spee∣dily and without any difficultie ease him of the same. The dust of a mouse pounded and beaten to powder, and mingled with a certaine oile, is very good and wholesome, for those which are grieued with a Tettor or scabbe which may ouerrunne their whole body. Pliny The braines or taile of a mouse being dried and beaten to powder is very medicinable for those which are troubled with the casting and shedding of their haire, as also for the disease called the Foxes euill, but this operation will worke more effectually if the shedding of the haire doth happen by any venom or poyson. The same in operation hath the whole body of the mouse being vsed in the aforesaide man∣ner. There is also another excellent remedy to cure and heale the aforesaid disease which is this, to take mice which inhabite in houses, and to burne or dry them in a pot, Galen and then beat them: and being so vsed, to mixe them with oyle of Lawrell, and to rubbe the haires which are like to fall or shed with garlicke, and to put them altogither into a Frontlet or fore-head cloath, and daily to keepe the same medicine or plaister vnto them, vntill the haire do grow fast, and they be ridde of that disease. There is also another remedy for the same disease, which is this: To burne a mouse, and beate him into powder and then to mingle the same with hony and the greace of a Beare, and so to annoint the head, Galen and this is accounted for a very speedy and effectuall cure. The dust or powder of mice being mixed with hony and oyle of Roses, and so baked, or boyled together, and afterward distilled into a cleare water and so powred into the eares of any one which is deafe or troubled with any paine in his eares, Pliny and it will quickly bring him helpe and remedie. The dust of a dryed mouse being also mingled with hony and rubbed vpon the teeth of any one which is troubled with a stinking breath, will pre∣sently take away the sauour thereof. Marcellus If the vrine of a man or woman be too fluent and aboundant, let them take the dust or powder of a dryed mouse, being beaten and stam∣ped, and mix it with wine or with goates milke, and so drinke it vp, and he shall speedily haue remedie. Galen The grieuous and violent inflammation or turning of the eye-lids, is cu∣red after this manner. First, they take the flesh of the mice, as soone as euer it is beaten small, and mingle it with the yolke of an egge, and mollifie it into a salue or plaister like vnto waxe, and then put it into a linnen cloath, and so wrap it vpon the eye lides in the time of sleepe, and it will easily bring helpe and remedy. There is an excellent remedy for the ouerspreding of the eyes, or to cure the disease in them, called the pin and the web, or to helpe them which are altogether blind, which is this: To take the blood of a mouse, the gall of a Cocke, and some part or quantitie of womans milke, and to take of each of them alike, and then to mingle or mixe them toge∣ther, & being well wrought or kneaded vntill it come to an ointment to rubbe or spread it vpon the eyes: and this will in very short space helpe them vnto their sight; For it hath beene tryed, and hath helped many. Galenus Paral. 3.16 The skinne of a mouse being burned or dryed, and beaten into powder, and so ming∣led with vinegar, and then annointed vpon the head of any one who is pained or trou∣bled with the heade-ache, it will presently ease and helpe him. The heade of a mouse be∣ing also born or carried in a linnen cloth, doth cure the same disease. The heads of mice being burned, Pliny Galenus and beaten into small powder, and then mixed or mingled with hony, and so annointed vpon the legges or feete of them which are troubled with the gowte, are ex∣cellent good and wholesome for the curing of that grieuous disease. The same vertue hath the tailes or bodies of Mice, being vsed in the aforesaid maner in them. Some doe thinke that the aforesaid disease is more speedily and effectually cured after this manner: First, Pliny to take a Beetle or horse-flye, and stampe it all to peeces, and then to mingle it with soft and liquid pitch, the skinne being prepared or made ready with nitre: but there must be great care taken that it eate not too farre in the flesh: then to take the head of a mouse, and the gall and dung of a mouse and mingle them together with ling-worte and pepper, and so to annoint them, and spread them vpon the aforesaid eaten or launced woundes: and this is very much commended for a very good and medicinable cure for the afore∣said disease. Sextus The heads of Mice dryed and beaten into powder or dust, and then mixed with hony, and so annointed vpon the eyes for the space of ten daies together, will clarifie the eyes, and expell all paine or blemishes from them. Of the heads of Mice being burned is made that excellent powder, Pliny for the scowring and cleansing of the teeth called tooth-soape: vnto which if spikenard be added or mingled, it will take away any filthy sent or stronge sauour in the mouth. The braines of a Mouse being taken and put or steeped in wine and stamped, Marcellus and beaten small and annointed vpon the brow or forehead of any one who is troubled with a paine or ache in the head, and he shall soone finde ease and remedy. If any man shall but touch or kisse with his mouth the snout or nostrils of a Mouse, and be troubled with the disease called the rewme which falleth downe and stuffeth the nostrils, he shall in very short space be eased of the same. The Magi or wise men doe very much commend this medicine for the expelling of a quartaine Ague or feuer, which is thus, To take the nose or snowt of a Mouse, as also the very tops of the eares, and bruse them together, and afterward tie them in a linnen cloath, which hath had Roses or Rose leaues in the same, Myrepsus and then bind them vnto the armes or wristes of him which is so troubled, and they will very effectually and speedily cure and heale him. For the rottennesse and demi∣nishing of the teeth, the best remedy is to take a liuing mouse and to take out one of her teeth whether the greatest or the least it is no great matter, and hang it by the teeth of the party grieued: but first kill the mouse from whom you had the tooth, and he shall pre∣sently haue ease and helpe of his paine. The hart of a liuing mouse being taken out, and hanged vpon the left arme of any woman, xtus is of such force and power, as it will cause her neuer to conceaue. The laps or fillets of the liuer of a Mouse, being beaten small and mingled with foure drams of sower and vnpleasant wine is an excellent remedy for those which are troubled with quakings in their ioynts, as also for feauers and shaking agues. Galenus A mouse being cut or parted in the coniunction of the sun and the Moone, and the liuer pul∣led out and roasted or boyled, and giuen to one which is troubled with the aforesaid dis∣ease to eate, will very speedily and without any difficulty or paine cure and heale him of the same. The gall of a Mouse being beaten very small, and steeped or washed in Vineger, Pliny and so poured or distilled into the eares of any one who is deafe or thicke of hearing, or hath any ach or paine in the same, is counted for the chiefest, and most singular and chie∣fest remedy or cure which is vsed for the same. Varro. The dung or durt of a mouse being new made, is very profitable for those which are trou∣bled with the disease called the sciatica or hip-gout, annointed or rubbed vpon the same. Mouse-dung being also mingled with vinegar and oile of roses, and so annointed or spred vpon the forehead or temples of any one who is troubled with the head-ach, Archigenes. will presenly ease and help him of the same. The gum called Benzoine being mixed with wine and Saf∣fron, and pepper, as also with the durt or dung of Mice being new made, and mixed with vinegar, and mingled al in one medicine, and so strained and giuen to one to drinke which is spare and leane, in some short space or time it will make him grow very fat. Pliny The dung or durt of a mouse being mingled with certaine other medicines, is very good and wholesome for those which are troubled with tetters, and dry scabs which o∣ouerrun the whole body. The dung of mice being mingled with the dust or pouder of Frankincense, wtih a little red arsenicke added thereunto, is a very profitable and wholesome medicine for those to vse which are troubled with little hand red bunches and swellings arising in diuers and se∣uerall parts of the body. Marcellus. Seuen pils being taken out of the dung of a mouse and mingled with vinegar and annointed vppon the forehead and temples, of those which are grieued therein, will very speedily help and cure them. The inward partes of earth mixed with mouse-dung, white Pepper, and Mirrhe, be∣ing of each of them halfe an ounce, & afterwards mingled with Vinegar altogether, and so annointed vpon the head of any one which is troubled with the megrime, will very effec∣tually and speedily ease and rid him of the same. Myrepsus The Hearbe called Strumus beaten to∣gether with Mouse-dung, and afterwardes mixed with vineger is an excellent remedy a∣gainst the swellinges in the head, or little bunches which arising therein become sores, and are full of matter and filthy corruption. The dung or durt of mice being melted, dis∣solued, and mingled with vineger, Marcellus. and then rubbed vpon the head of any one who is trou∣bled with the scurfe or skaules thereon in a bath or stone, will presently expell and driue them quite away. The dung of mice being mingled with Frankincense, and so beaten or tempered together vntill they come vnto the likenesse or thicknesse of hony, and then an∣nointed vpon the legs or feet of any one that is troubled with the gout, he shall find pre∣sent help and remedy. The same disease is also very effectually cured by the dung of a mouse, & burned or scor∣ched barly mingled together, of each being the same weight or quantity, Galenus & afterwards mix¦ed with vineger altogether, and so spread or annointed vpon the diseased parts. Ther is al∣so another excellent remedy for curing of the aforesaid disease which is thus: to take Can∣tharides and bruise them all to pieces, and mingle them with soft or liquid Pitch, and also with Nitre, and so anoint or rub them vppon the skinne being prepared for the purpose, Pliny. but there must be great care had that the skin bee not rubbed or launced too far. After∣wards vnto the wounds so made, there must be taken the heads, gales, and dung of mice, being mixed with the hearb Lingwort, and pepper, and so beaten altogether vntill they come vnto a temperate salue or medicine, and then anointed vpon the said wounds, and they will in very short space cure the same. The haires and dung of a Mouse, parched or dryed by the fire, and annointed vpon the eie-lids of any one which are pield or bare, will presently procure haire to grow thereon. Mouse-dung being dried in the shade is an excellent remedy against voyding of spet∣ting of blood which floweth from some parts of the body, but especially from the belly. Alexius Pe¦demontanas. The same is also very good to staunch the blood which issueth from woundes being new made. White Sceny-seede, and the dung of a Mouse or Hare being put into broath with the stem or stalke of Fennell, and so boyled together, and afterwards giuen vnto a Wo∣man to drinke who is destitute of milke in her breastes, will presently and very speedily procure her milke in great aboundance. The dung of Mice being steeped or washed in raine water, doth ease and refresh the swelling of womens dugs in their time of deliuery. The dung of a Mouse being giuen in any drinke or liquor to one that is troubled with the disease called the collick and stone to drinke, will in very short space or time cure him of the same. Mouse dung being also ta∣ken in drinke doth loose the body of either man or woman how fast soeuer they be bound. There is an excellent remedy arising from Mouse-dung against the Sciatica or hip-gout which is this: to take nine graines of a Mouses dung mixed or mingled with halfe a pinte of wine, Marcellus and giuen to the party grieued vpon a bench or foote-stoole to drinke, so that he drinke it standing vpon that foot only which paineth him, euen at the sun rising, and ha∣uing so drunke it, let him leape downe, and afterwardes let him leape three times, and let him do this but three daies together, and hee shall haue present help and remedy of his disease. Dioscorides Auicen Mouse-dung mixed with Frankincense and sweete Wine, and so drunke by any one which is troubled with the collick and stone, will presently ease him of the same. But the dung of mice mingled with Frankincense, water, and Hony, and so boiled together, and drunke, doth not onely driue away the paine of the aforesaid disease, but also doth breake and quite dissolue the stone. Pliny Mouse-dung also being taken in drinke by it selfe alone, doth dissolue and melt the stone in the bladder. The same being also boyled in water is very good and profitable for those which cannot make Water. The same being new made and annointed vpon the belly of any one who is troubled with the collicke or stone, shall finde present ease and remedy thereby. There is yet moreouer another excellent medicine proceeding from this dung, wher∣by the fruite in a Womans wombe may be brought forth either dead or putryfied with∣out any hurt or preiudice vnto the Woman, which is thus; first to take Egyptian salt, mouse-dung, Hippocrates and Gourds which are sowen in woods, and afterwards to poure in halfe a pinte of Hony, being halfe boyled, and to cast one dram of Rozen into the Honny, the Gourdes, and the mouse-dung, and beate them well and throughly together, and then roule them vp, and fashion them in the manner of acornes, and put them to the belly of the party so grieued as often as you shall thinke it meete and conuenient, and in vsing this some short space or time you shalsee the aforesaid putryfied fruit to proceed and issue forth. Mouse-dung being parched or burned and mingled with Hony, is very good and me∣dicinable aswell for those which are troubled with the swellings in their legs and feete, as also for those whose eye-lids are pilled and bald, Auicen to make haire to grow again vpon them, being spreade or annointed thereuppon. The dunge of mice being dryed and beaten into small dust or pouder, and put into the teeth of any one which are hollow, will present∣ly expell away all paine from them, Marcellus and also confirme and make the teeth strong. The dust or pouder which proceedeth from mouse-dung is also very good to cure any disease in the fundament of either man or woman. The vrine of a mouse is of such strong force that if it shal but touch any part of a mans body, it will eate vnto the very bones. The bitings of mice are healed by no other means but by greene figes and Garlike being mixed or mingled together, and so annoynted thereupon. OF THE RAT. T Here is no doubt that this beast be∣longeth also to the rank of mice, The vulgar Rat, or great domesticall Mouse. & the name thereof we haue shewed already, is commō both to the French, Spanish, Italian, and English, & it may seeme to be deriued from the Greeke word Rastes, or Heurex, or Riscos, for the Gretians vse al those words. And this beast is 4. times so big as the commō Mouse, The quanti∣ty of Rats & their parts. being of a blackish dusky colour, more whit on the belly, hauing along head, not much vnlike the head of the Martin, short and round eares, a resonable rough skin, short legs, and long clawes, & exceeding great eies, such as cā see very perfectly in the darke night, and more perfectly then by candle light, with their nails they climbe vp steepe and hard wals, their taile is very long, & almost naked void of haire, by reason whereof it is not vnwor∣thily counted venomous, for it seemeth to partake with the na¦ture of Serpents. The quantity of their body is much like a wea∣sels, & sometimes you shall see a Rat exceeding the common stature, which the Germans cal Ratzen Kunig, the king of Rats, because of his larger & greater body, and they say that the les∣ser bring him meat and helieth idle. But my opinion is that as we read of the Dormous she nourisheth hir parent when she is old, so likewile the younger Rats bring food vnto the elder, because through their age, they are not able to hunt for them∣selues, & are also growne to a great and vnweeldy stature of body. Sometimes you shal see white Rats, as was once seene in Germany, taken in the middle of Aprill, hauing very red eyes standing forth of their head, and a rough and long beard. And at Auspurg in Germany, about the Temple called the Church of S. Hulduic they a∣bound in greater number then in other places. They do not lye in the earth like Mice, ex∣cept in the vally of Ioachim, where for the summer time they forsake houses, and go into cony holes, but in the winter time they returne to the houses againe. They are more noy∣some then the little Mouse, for they liue by stelth, and feed vpon the same meat that they feede vpon, and therefore as they exceede in quantity, so they deuoure more, and doe farre more harme. They are killed by the same poysons and meates that the common Mice are killed, except wolfe-baine, for if they eate thereof, they vomit it vp againe and are safe. They are also taken in the same traps, but 3. or foure times so big; Their flesh is farre more hot and sharp then the flesh of the vulgar Mouse, as we haue gathered by the dissection of it, and therefore in operation it is very like that it expelleth and dryeth more then the other. Medicins by Rats. Poyson of Rats. The excrements are also of the same vertue, and with the dung of Rats the Physitians cure the falling off of the haire. And it is saide also that when they rage in lust, and follow their copulation, they are more venemous and dangerous then at other times. For if the vrine do fall vpon the bare place of a man, it maketh the flesh rot vnto the bones, neither will it suffer any scar to bee made vppon the vlcer, and thus much of the vulgar Rat. OF THE WATER RAT. S Eeing there are two kinds of Rats, one of the earth called Rattus ter∣restris, Names of Water-Rats. and the other of the water called Rattus Fluuiatilis, of which we are now to entreat, being also called of the Latins Mus aquaticus by the Germans Twassermaus, and Wafferrat, by the Italians Sorgo∣mogange, Meate of Water-Rats. by the French Rat d, eau. This beast hunteth fishes in the winter, and haue certaine caues in the water sides, and bankes of the riuers or ponds: For which occasion it being seene in the waters, de∣ceiueth their expectation which looke for the returne of it to the land. And this beast hath beene forgotten by the ancients, for they haue left of it no dis∣cription nor story, because it liueth partly in the water, and partly on the land, and ther∣fore he said true that spake of the habitation and place of aboade of this beast, in this sort, Ego non in fluuijs, Places of wa¦ter rats abod nec alijs aquis magnis, sed paruis tantum riuis at{que} herbosis omnium ipis, hoc animal frequentissimum versari audio. That is to say, That this beast doth not keepe in great waters or riuers, but in small and little currents and pondes, where aboundance of grasse and other weedes doe grow on the sides and bankes; Pliny attributeth that to the warer-rat, A wonder in the parts of a female Rat which is proper to the Tortise, for indeed there is some similitude of natures be∣twixt these beasts, with this exception, that the females in this kind haue three visible pas∣sages for their excrements, one for their vrine, another for the dung, and the third for the young ones, that is a peculiare place for the littering of their young ones, and this water-rat ouer and beside her common nature with other Rats, doth swim ouer riuers, and feed vpon herbs, and if at any time she be hunted from her natiue biding & accustomed lodg∣ing, then also she goeth among vulgar & common Rats and mice, and feedeth vpon such as they eate: and ( Bellonius saith) that there are great store of these in Nilus and Strym n, and that in calme nights when there are no winds, they walke to the shores, & get vp vp∣on the bankes, eating and gnawing such plants as grow neare the waters, and if they heare any noise, they suddenly leape into the Waters againe. He expresseth also the figure of this Rat, which we haue omitted because it resembleth in all partes the common Rat, ex∣cepting the snout or beake which is rounder & blunter. Among some of the ancients also, there is mention made of this beast, and no more. Therfore Aristotle saith in the Arcadian Lusae, which is a city so called, (as Stephanus writeth,) where Malampus did wash the daugh∣ters of Proetus, and deliuered them from their madnesse. There is a certaine fountaine wherein do liue Rats of the earth, (they should say Rats of the water) for hereunto agree both Pliny and Theophrastus. Likewise in a riuer of Cassinus ; the auncient wise-men, which were followers of Zoroastres, made great account of the Hedghog, but hated deadly the water-rats, and said, that he that could kil most of them, was most deare and acceptable to God. And furthermore they said, that dogs, hens, and hedghogs, did proceed, and were attended from and by good angels, and water-rats by euill. And thus much shal suffice for the discourse of the Rat. The story which ensueth is of strange and lesse knowne Mice, and therefore I wil disttibure them after an alphabiticall order; according to their seueral names. Of the Alpine-Mouse T He Alpine Mouse taketh her name from the Alpes wherein she is bred, and al∣thogh there be many other kindes of mice bred in the Alpes, yet this being the principal thereof, recei∣ueth denomination from the moun∣taines, because they are bred in the ve∣ry tops of the mountaines, and sildom or neuer come down to the roots. The Italians cal it Marmota, and Murmont, and according to Matheolus, Marmon∣tana, the Rhaetians Montanella, and in some part of Italy Varrosa, in Fraunce Marmote, although Marmot be a word also among them for a Munkey. The Germans and especially the Helueti∣ans by a corrupt word, drawne from a mouse of the mountain, Murmelthier, and Murmentle, and some Mistbellerle, by reason of his sharpe whining voyce like a little Dogs. In Latine it is called also Emptra, which seemeth to be com∣pounded of Embdor, & this is the least kind of Alpine Mice which is found in all the German regions, of which wee wil speake in the end of this story. Som take this to be called Taxus, amongst whom Brassauolus is one, yet it hath no property with the Alpine mouse, ex∣cept lying in a Caue, for it doeth not sleepe in the winter, nor hath no out∣ward resemblance with mice, neither can haue affinity in disposition or ma∣ner of liuing, & therfore I canot assent thereto. Grapaldus and Alununs, both learned Italians say, that the Armelins are called Alpine mice, wherunto they are led, because they sleepe al the win∣ter long, like the Alpine mouse; But wee shall shew in their due place, that these belong to the weasils, and not to the mice, which liuing in colde coun∣tries, growe white in the winter time: the Haebrew word is Saphan, acording to some Authors, and is translated Ar∣cktonim, but we will shew in due place, that the Arcktomys is the Crycetus, or Grycet -mouse, and the Saphan we haue shewed already to be the Cony. These Alpin Mice are in the tops of the Apenine hils, and none of the Auncientes ex∣cept Pliny make mention thereof, and it is doubtfull whether he doeth describe it or no. For his words are, Sunt his Muribus Alpinis, pares & in Egypto similiter{que} residunt in clunibus & binis pedibus gradiuntur, prioribus{que}, vt manibus vtuntur, that is to say, there are mice in Egypt like to the Alpin Mice, for they sit vpon their Buttocks, and goe with their fore∣most two feet, which also they vse insteed of hands, by which we collect, that they are not the same, but like the Alpine mice. The quantity of this beast, and the seue∣rall parts. The Alpine mouse is in quantity like a Hare, or at the least betwixt a Hare and a Co∣ny, being more fat, and of a thicker body then a Cat, but shorter legges in outward ap∣pearance most like a mouse, and therefore it is called an Alpine mouse. The backe of it is very broad, and the haire harder and harsher then a Conies. The colour for the most part is yellow, Mathaeolus. which in some is more cleare, and in others more obscure and browne. Their eyes of a reasonable quantity, standing farre out of their heads. Their eares very short like cropt eares. The head like a Hares, and their feet with long nails, his foreteeth like a squir∣rels, two aboue, and two beneath, but long and sharpe like a Beuers, in colour yellowe, about the nose and vpper-lippes, he hath long-blacke-bristle-haires like a cat. The taile, is halfe a cubit long, according to Stumpsius, but two palmes according to Agricola. His legges very short and thicke, couered with long deep thicke haire, like to the bottome of his belly. The toes of his feet are like a Beares, and his clawes long and blacke, wherewithall be diggeth the earth to make his denne, he goeth vpon his hinder feete like a Beare, or like an Ape, by iumpes, and with his forefeet he taketh his meat like a squirrell & an Ape, sit∣ting in the meane time vpon his buttockes. His backe is also very fatte, although all the other parts of his body be leane, and yet that on his backe cannot be said to be fat, but ra∣ther like a cowes vdder, neither fat nor flesh, and they encrease or grow more in bredth, then in length. The descrip∣tion of the great Alpine mouse. Scaliger describeth them in this manner, a Marmot (saith he, for so he tearmeth an Al∣pine mouse in French) is a Beast about the bignesse of a Badger, hauing haire and tayle much like it, and after the same manner short legges, and little or no eares, long, sharp, firme, crooked, strong, and blacke clawes, which is numbred amongst the kinds of mice, with whom it holdeth little correspondence, except that like a squirell it taketh his meate in the forefeet as with hands, and eateth sitting vppon his taile. They agree also with the Dormouse in their sleepe, for they passe ouer winter sleeping. Their teeth are like to the teeth of hares and mice, after that they are made tame, they are not hurtfull to men or children, except they be prouoked. Being kept in houses, they will eat and gnaw all linnen and woolen cloath, Thus farre Scaliger. But we haue shewed al∣ready that the outward appearance of it is like a mouse, and that therefore it is safer to fol∣low Pliny, Albertus, Mathaeolus, Stumpsius, and others, then his sole and singular opinion; they keepe as we haue said already in the tops of the mountaines wherein they make their caue with woonderfull art and circumspection, The places of their abod and then sin¦gular art in making their caue. making two different passages into their denne, one aboue another a poles length, which meete in the middle like a forke, or the coniunction of two riuers or pathe-waies, making the seate of their rest to be very deepe in the Mountaine, and therein they remaine, fiue, seauen, nine, or eleuen of them toge∣ther. They play many times before the mouth of their denne together, and in their sport or pastime, Their obser∣uation of watch. barke like little Dogges. When they go out of their caue into the mountaines to gather foode, or to playe, or to fetch in grasse, alwaies one of them remaineth like a Watchman neare the mouth of the caue vpon some high place, looking most diligently and vigilantly, both farre and neare; and if he see eyther a man or wilde beast comming towardes them, then hee suddainely cryeth out, and with his voice giueth the warning word, whining like the whisling of a pipe, if his fellowes be farre off, or else barking like a Dogge if they be neare at hand. When the residue heare it, they presently repaire home, and he which kept the watch, entereth into the denne last of all. And it is reported by a certaine Greeke writer, that if their speculator doe not giue them the watch-worde, but that they are endaungered by any man or Beaste thorough his negligence, they teare him in pieces with their teeth. There is no beast which is so strong as this, Stumsius considering the quantity, for it hath beene seene that when a lusty young man tooke one of them by the hinder leg as it ran into the den, he could not withall his might plucke it backe againe. The strength of this beast. The clawes of it are exceeding sharpe, and fit to dig, so that it is thought if a man find them in the earth, and seeke to take them by digging vnto them, he shall labour in vaine, because the beast diggeth faster from him then he can follow her; they cannot run very fast in the plaine ground, but are easily killed by a man, except they get into the earth: with their teeth they bite deepe, for they can shere asunder wood with them like Beauers, Their vsuall foode. they eate or liue vpon fruits & especially being tamed when they are young, they refuse not bread, flesh, fish, or pottage, and aboue all they desire milk, Butter, and cheese, for in the Alpes they will breake into the little cottages where milk is kept, and are oftentimes taken in the manner sucking vp the milke, for they make a noise in sucking of milke like a pig. In the month of May they are much delighted to eate hornets, or horseflies, also they feede vp∣on wilde Sagapen of the meddow, and seeded Cabages, and while they are wilde in the Mountaines they neuer drink, the reason is as I suppose because in the summer time they eate moist greene herbs, and in all the winter time they sleepe. Towards the feast of Saint Michaell the Arch-angell, and of Gallus, they enter into their caues, and as Pliny saith, they first of all carry prouision of Hay, Entrance in∣to their caues and greene Hearbes into their denne to rest vpon, wherein their wit and vnderstanding is to be admired, for like Beauers one of them falleth on the back, and the residue loade his belly with the car∣riage, and when they haue laid vpon him sufficient, he girteth it fast by taking his tayle in his mouth, and so the residew draw him to the caue, but I cannot affirme certainely, whe∣ther this be a truth or a falsehood. For there is no reason that leadeth the Author thereunto, but that some of them haue beene found bald on the backe. But this is certaine, when the Snow begins to couer the Mountaines, then doe they enter into their dennes, and shut vp close the passages, with Stickes, Grasse, and earth, both so hard and so thicke, that it is easier to breake the solide ground, then the mouthes of their Caues, and so being safely encluded both from the feare of the Hunters, from Raine, Snow, and cold, there they liue vntill the Spring with∣out all manner of meate and drinke, gathered round together like a Hedghogge, sleeping continually, and therefore the people inhabiting the Alpes haue a common prouerbe, Their conti∣nual sleepe al the winter time. to expresse a drowsie and sleepy fellow in the German tongue thus. Er musse synzyt ges∣chlaffen haben wie ein murmelthier, in Latine thus, Necesse habet certum, dormiendo, tempus consumere, instar muris Alpini, He must needes sleepe a little like the Mouse of the Alpes. They sleepe also when they be tamed, but it hath beene found by experience, that when a tame one hath beene taken asleepe and layd in a warme barrell vpon Hay, the mouth be∣ing shutte and closed to keepe out Raine and Snow, at the opening thereof it was found dead; and the reason was, because it lacked breath, and therefore this is most wonderfull that in the Mountaines, notwithstanding the close stopping of the mouth of their caues, yet they should not bee depriued of refrigeration, that is fresh ayre, for expiration, and respiration. But this is to be considered, that after they haue beene long tamed, they sleepe not so much as when they are wild, for I thinke that their continuall eating of rawe and greene Hearbes, ingendereth in them so many humors as cannot bee dispersed without along continuing sleepe, but afterwardes when they are dieted with such meate as is prouided for the nourishment of man, they are eased of the cause, and so the effect ceaseth. During the time that they sleepe, they grow very fat, and they are not awaked very easily, Growing fat with sleepe. except with the heat of the sun or fire, or a hot-house. Now the manner of their taking while they are wilde is thus. In the summer time when they goe in and out of their caues, they are taken with snares set at the mouth thereof, but in the Winter time when they goe not abroad, The taking of these beasts. then also are the inhabitants forced to another deuise, for then in the summer time, they sette vp certaine pillers or perches neare the mouth of their denne, whereby they may be dy∣rected, when the snow doth couer the mountaines. For the Pillers or poles stand vp aboue the snow, although the snow bee very deepe. Then come the inhabitants vpon round pieces of wood in the middest of the winter, fast∣ned to their shooe-soles ouer the deepe snow with their pyoners and diggers, and cast a∣way the snow from the den, and so dig vp the earth, and not onely take the beastes, but carry them away sleeping, and while they dig, they diligently obserue the frame and ma∣ner of the stopping of the Mouses den. For if it be long and deepe, it is a signe of a long and a hard winter, but if it be shallow and thin, of the contrary: so comming vpon them as we haue saide, they take them and carry them away asleepe, finding alwaies an odde number among them, and they diligently obserue, that whilest they dig, there bee no great noise, or that they bring not their fire too near thē. For as Stumpsius saith, Experrecti enim capinon possunt, nam vt cun{que} strenue fodiat venator, ipsi fodiendo simul & retrocedunt & pedibus quam effoderint, terram reijciendo fossorem impediunt. That is to say, If they bee once awaked, they can neuer be taken, for howsoeuer the Hunter dig neuer so manfully, yet they together with him, dig inward into the mountaines, and cast the earth backward with their feete to hinder his worke. Being taken as we haue saide, they grow very tame, and especially in the presence of their keepers, Their taming & condicions in the house. before whom they will play and sport, and take Lice out of their heads with their forefeet like an Ape. Insomuch as there is no beast that was euer wild in this part of the world, that becommeth so tame and familiar to man as they, yet doe they alwaies liue in the hatred of dogges, and oftentimes bite them deepely, hauing them at any aduan∣tage, especially in the presence of men, where the dogs dare not resist nor defend them∣selues. When they are wilde they are also killed asleepe, by putting of a knife into their throate, whereat their forefeete stirre a little, but they dye before they can bee awa∣ked. Their blood is saued in a vessell, and afterwards the Mouse it selfe is dressed in hot scal∣ding water like a pig, The sauing & vse of their flesh. and the haire thereof plucked off, and then do they appeare bald and white; next to that they bowell them, and take out their intrals: afterwards put in the bloud againe into their bellies, and so seeth them or else salt them, and hang them vp in smoake, and being dressed after they are dryed, they are commonly eaten in the Alpine regions with Rapes and Cabiges, and their flesh is very fat, not a fluxible or loose fat like the fat of Lambes, but a solide fat, like the fat of Hogs and Oxen. And the flesh hereof is com∣mended to be profitable for women with child, and also for all windinesse and gripings in the belly, not onely the flesh to be eaten in meate, but also the fat to be annointed vpon the belly or Nauel: And for this cause it is vsed to procure sleepe, and to strengthen decai∣ed and weake sinnewes: the flesh is alwaies better salted then fresh, because the salt drieth vp the ouermuch humidity, and also amendeth the grauity and ranknesse of the sauour: but whether it be salt, or whether it fresh, it is alwaies hard to be digested, oppressing the stomacke, and heating the body ouermuch. The ventricle or maw of the Mouse Alpine, is prescribed to be layed vpon the belly a∣gainst the collicke. the medicines of this beast. If the hands of a man be annointed with the fat of this beast, it is said he shall be the better able to endure cold al that day after: Also the same fat being drunke vp in warme broath by a woman in trauaile, are beleeued to accelerate and hasten her deli∣uery. Certaine Horseleeches, in the cure of that disease which they call the worms, which are certaine vlcers rising in the body, do mingle this fat with other medicines which are very drying or scepticke. And Mathaeolus doth prescribe it for the softning and mollifieng of contracted nerues and ioynts in the body. By the discourse aforesaide, it doth appeare that of these Alpine-Mice, there are two kinds, The descrip∣on of the Emp a or lit¦ le Alpine Mouse. one great like a Badger, and the other in stature of a Hare or cony: This lesser see∣meth to be proper to Germany, which there they call Embdor, of the Latin word Emp ra, a mouse of the mountain. The story wherof I thought good to expresse being short out of Stumpsius and Agricol . The male and females say they of this kind, do gather together wilde corne which grow∣eth among the rockes in the summer time against the winter, and carry the same into the holes of the earth where their lodging is. Now the female in this kind is crafty, and more apt to deuoure; the male on the other∣side more thirsty and sparing, wherefore he driueth his female out of the den in the win∣ter time, and stopeth the mouth of his caue, to forbid hir entrance, but she getteth behind the same, and diggeth a secret hole, whilest the male lyeth at the mouth asleepe, Albertus. she con∣sumeth the whole store behind him, wherefore in the spring time she commeth forth ve∣ry fat and comely, and he very leane. And therefore in my opinion, the makers of Em∣blems may very well discribe an vnthrifty wise, that consumeth her husbands wealth, by the picture of this female, as by the picture of the Asse behinde Ocnus, biting assunder the cord that he weaueth, as we haue shewd before in the history of the Asse. These beasts giue themselues much to sleep, and when they are awake they are neuer ydle, but alwaies carrying into their denne, straw, hay, sticks, rags, or peeces of cloth, wherewith they ful theirmouth so ful, that it may receiue no more, and if they meet with any thing which to big for their mouth, by the helpe of their feete, they drawe and rowle it to their owne denne. Whereas they are nourished tame in houses, it is obserued, that they are a neate and cleanly kind of beast, for they neuer defile their lodgings with their excrements, but seeke out some secret corner, wherein they both render vrin, and empty their bellies. With their teeth they gnaw wood, and make holes in bords, so larg as their bodies may passe throgh, and while they liue, they haue a very ranke and stronge sauour like a mouse, especially in the Summer time while they are leane, and before they growe fat; for such is the nature of this beast, that in the Summer time they labour and grow leane, but in the winter time they sleepe, and grow fat. And thus much for the Alpine mouse. OF THE DORMOVSE. T He Dormouse is called in Latin Glis, and in Greek Myoxos, the reason of the Latine name Glis, The names and reasons thereof. is taken from gliscere which signifieth to grow fat, according to the saying of Co∣lumella. Paleis vero quibus fere omnes regiones abundant, ssi∣nus gliscit, That is to say, an Asse groweth fatte by eating chaffe which aboundeth in all countries. This word glis, signifieth not onely a beast, but a peece of fatte earth and and also a Thistle, whereupon Syluaticus made this verse. Glis animal, glis terra tenax, glis lappa vocatur. The Italians call it, Lo, galero, Lo, gliero, or giero, the Spa∣niards Liron, the French likewise Liron, and Rat: Liron, and Vngloyer, and Vngratvevl, the Germans, Ein greul, the Heluetians, ein rell, or Relmus, or Gros haselmus but our English Dormouse, seemeth to be a compounded worde of Dormiens mus, that is, a sleeping mouse. The Polonians call him Scurez. But concerning his name Myoxus, there is some question among the Authors. For Saint Ierom writing vpon the eleuenth chapter of Le∣uiticus, and the 66. Chapter of Esay, translateth Akbar the Hebrew word for a mouse, glirem a Dormouse, and he giueth this reason, because all the countries of the East, mea∣ning Graetia, doe say, that Myoxus is a Dormouse. And this Myoxus by Epiphanius in his Ankerot is alleadged to prooue the resurrection. Myoxus saith he, animal semestre mori∣tur, & rursus post tempore sua revivisset. The Dormouse at halfe a yeere olde dyeth, and after hir full time reuiueth againe: And in his booke against heresies, he speaketh thus to Origen. The descrip∣tion of the Dormouse out of Epi∣phanius. Tradunt naturae rerum experti, Myoxum latitare, & foetus suos sinaul in eodem loco, multos parere: quinque, & amplius, viperus autem hos venari, & si inuenerit totum latibu∣lum ipsa vipera, quum non posset omnes deuorare, pro vna vice ad satietatem cdit vnum aut duos, reliquorum vero oculos expungit, & cibos affert, excaecatosque enutrit, donec voluerit vnumquem{que} eorum deuorare. Si vero contigerit, vt aliqui inexperti in hos incidant, ipsos{que} in cibum sumant, venenum sibi ipsis sumunt, eos qui à viperae veneno sunt enutriti. Sic eti∣am ô tu Origines à Groeca doctrina mente excaecatus, venenum his qui tibi crediderunt, e o∣muisti, & factus es ipsis in edulium venenatum, ita vt per quae ipse iuiuria affectus es, per es plus iniurta afficeris. The Philosophers which are cunning in the nature of things doe write that the Dor∣mouse doth lye hid, and bring forth many yoong ones in the same place where he lyeth, fiue or more at a time, and the vipers doe hunt these to destroy them: now if the viper finde their nest, because she cannot eate them all at one time at the first, she filleth hir selfe with one or two, and putteth out the eyes of the residue, and afterwards bringeth them meat and nourisheth them being blind, vntill the time that her stomack serueth her to eat them euery one. But if it happen that in the meane time, any man chaunce to light vpon these Vipers-nourished blinde Dormise, and to kill & eat them, they poyson themselues through the venom which the viper hath left in them, so fareth it with thee O Origem, for thou art blinded with the Graecians doctrin, & dost vomit out that poison into their harts which do beleeue thee, that thou art made vnto them a venemous meate, whereby thou dost wrong others, as thou hast bene wrongd thy selfe. By which it is manifest, that Myoxus is neither a Toad nor a Frog, but the Dormous. And the charme which is made for the Asses vrine, as we haue shewed already in his sto∣ry, Gallus bibit, & non meijet, Myoxus meijet, & non bibit. whether they render vrine & drinke not The cocke drinketh and maketh not water, the Dormous maketh water and neuer drinketh. But whether it be true or no that she neuer drinketh, I dare not affirme: But this is certain, that she drinketh but very sildome, and it ought to be no wonder that she should make water, for tame Conies, as long as they can feed vpon greene hearbes, do render abundance of vrine, and yet neuer drink. The Graecians also do call this beast Elayos, although that word do likewise signifie a Squirel. In Maesia a wood of Italy, there is neuer founde Dormous, except at the time of their littering. They are bigger in quantity then a squirrel, the colour variable, somtimes black, The quantity colour and se¦uerall partes. somtimes grisled, sometimes yellowe on the backe, but alwaies a white belly, hauing a short haire, and a thinner skinne then the pontike mouse. They are also to be found in Heluetia, about Clarona. It is a biting and an angry beast, and therefore sildome taken aliue. The beake or snowt is long, the eares short and pricked, the taile short, and not very hairy at the ende. The middle of the belly swelleth downe betwixt the breast and the loyns, which are more narrow and trussed vp together, they are alwaies very fat, and for that cause they are cal∣led Lardironi. Bucke-mast is very acceptable meat vnto them, and doth greatly fatten them, Their food. they are much delighted with walnuts, they climbe trees, and eat Apples, according to some, (but Albertus saith more truely,) that they are more delighted with the iuyce then with the Apple. For it hath bin oftentimes sounde, that vnder Apple trees, they haue opened much fruite, and taken out of it nothing but the kernels, for such is their wit and policie, that hauing gathered an Aple, they presently put it in the twist of a tree betwixt bowes, and so by sitting vpon the vppermost bough presse it assunder. They also grow fat by this meanes. In auncient time they were wont to keepe them in coopes or tunnes, and also in Gar∣dens paled about with boord, where there are beeches or Wal-nut trees growing, Norishers & nourishing of Dormice. and in some places they haue a kind of earthen potte, wherein they put them with Wal-nuttes, Buck-mast, and Chesnets. And furthermore it must be obserued, that they must be pla∣ced in romes conuenient for them to breed young ones, their water must be very thinne, because they vse not to drinke much, and they also loue dry places. Titus Pompeius (as Varro saith) did nourish a great many of them enclosed, and so al∣so Herpinus in his park in Gallia. It is a beast wel said to be Animal Semiferum, a creatur half wilde, for if you set for them hutches, and nourish them in warrens together, it is obser∣ued, that they neuer assemble, but such as are brede in those places: And if straungers come among them which are seperated from them, either by a mountaine, or by a riuer, Society and charity in them. Pliny. they discry them, and fight with them to death. They nourish their parents in their old age, with singular piety. We haue shewed al∣ready, howe they are destroyed by the Viper, and it is certaine, that all serpentes lie in wait for them. Their old age doth end euery winter. They are exceeding sleepy, and there∣fore Martiall saith: Somniculosos illi porrigit glires. They grow fat by sleeping, and therefore Ausonius hath an elegant verse; Dic, cessante cibo, somno quis opimior est? glis? Because it draweth the hinder legges after it like a Hare, it is called Animal tractile, for it goeth by iumpes and little leapes. In the winter time they are taken in deepe ditches that are made in the woods, couered ouer with small stickes, straw, and earth, which the cun∣trymen deuise to take them when they are asleepe. The meane to take these Dormice. At other times they leap from tree to tree like Squirrelles, and that they are killed with arrowes as they goe from bough to bough, especially in hollowe trees: for when the hunters finde their haunt wherein they lodge, they stop the hole in the absence of the Dormouse, and watch her turne backe a∣gaine: the silly beast finding her passage closed, is busied hande and foote to open it for entrance, and in the mean season commeth the hunter behind her and killeth her. In Tellina they are taken by this meanes: The countrimen going into the fields, carryeth in their hands burning torches in the night time, which whē the silly beast perceiueth, with admiration thereof flocketh to the lights, whereunto when they were come, they were so daseled with the brightnesse that they were starke blinde, and might so bee taken with mens hands. The vse of the flesh of these mice. The vse of them being taken was, to eat their flesh, for in Rhetia at this day they salt it and eat it, because it is sweet and fat like swines flesh. Ammianus Marcellinus wondereth at the delicacy of his age, because when they were at their tables, they called for ballaunces to weigh their fish, and the members of the Dor-mouse, which was not done (saith hee) without anye dislike of some present, and thinges not heretofore vsed, are now comen∣ded daily. Appitius also prescribeth the muscles and flesh inclosed of them, taken out of e∣uery member of a Dormous, beaten with pepper, Nut-kernels, Parcenippes, and Butter, stuffed altogether into the belly of a Dormous, and sewed vp with thread, and so baked in an Ouen, or sod in a kettle, to be an excellent and delicate dish. And in Italy at this day they eat Dormice (saith Coelius, ) yet there were ancient lawes among the Romans, called Leges censoriae, whereby they were forbidden to eat Dormice, strange birds, shel-fish, the neckes of beasts, and diuers such other things. And thus much shal suffice for the descrip∣tion of the Dormouse. The medicines of the Dormouse. Dormyse being taken in meate, doe much profit against the Bulimon; The pow∣der of Dormyse mixed with oyle, Pliny doth heale those which are scalded with any hot lic∣ker. A liue Dormouse doth presently take away all warts being bound thereupon. Dor∣myse, and field-mice being burnt, and their dust mingled with hony, will profit those which desire the clearnesse of the eyes, if they doe take thereof some small quantitie euery morning. Marcellus The powder of a Dormouse, or field mouse rubbed vpon the eyes help∣eth the aforesaid disease. A Dormouse being flead, roasted and annointed with oyle, and salt, being giuen in meate, is an excellent cure for those that are short winded. The same also doth very effectually heale those that spit out filthy matter or corruption. Powder of Dormice, or fielde-mice, or yoong wormes, being mixed with oyle doth heale those that haue kibes on their heeles, or chilblaines on their hands. The fatte of a Dormouse, the fatte of a hen, and the marrow of an Oxe melted together, and being hot, infused into the eares, doth very much profit both the paines and deafenesse thereof. Sextus The fatte of Dormice being boyled, as also of field-mice, are deliuered to be most profitable for the eschewing of the palsie. That fat of a Dormouse is also very excellent for those which are troubled with a palsie or shaking of the ioynts. The skinne and inward parts of a Dormouse being taken forth, and boyled with hony in a new vessell, and after∣wards powred into an other vessell, Pliny will very effectually heale all diseases which are inci∣dent to the eares, being anointed thereupon. The skinne of a Dormouse or a silke worme being pulled off, and the inward parts thereof being boyled in a new brasen vessell with hony, Marcellus from the quantitie of 27. ounces euen to three, and so kept, that when there is need of a certaine bathing vessell, the medicine being made warme and powred into the eares, doth helpe all paines, deafenesse, or inflammation of the eares. The fat of a Dormouse is commended to be very medicinable for the aforenamed diseases. The same is profi∣table for all paines, aches, or griefes in the belly. The vrine of a Dormouse is an excellent remedy against the palsie, And thus much shall suffice concerning the medicinall vertues of the Dormouse. Of the Hamester, or Cryetus, the first figure taken by Mychaell Horus. The second picture taken by Iohn Kentmant, and it is her fashion and portracture to lie thus when she is angry, for so doth her colour appeare both on the backe and belly. T His beast is called in Latine Crycetus, and in the Germaine toung Hamester, Traner, and Kornfaerle, The names that is piggs of the corne. It is a little beast, not much bigger then a Rat, dwel∣ing in the earth of the rootes of corne, she is not drawne a∣gainst her wil out of her caue at any time, The descrip∣tion. but by powring hot water or some other lickor. The head of it is of diuers colours, the backe red, the belly white, and the haire stic∣keth so fast to the skin, that it is easier to pul the skin from the flesh, then any part of the haire from the skin. It is but a little Beast as we haue said, but very ap to bite and fight, and ful of courage, and therefore hath receiued from nature this ornament and defence, that it hath a bonie helmet, couering the head and the braine when it standeth vp, vppon the hinder legges: It resembleth both in colour and proportion a Bear. of the Arcto¦mys And for this cause some writers haue interpreted it to be the beast called Arctomys, thus described by Saint Ierom. It is a creature (saith he) abounding in the regions of Palastina, dwelling alwaies in the holes of rockes and caues of the earth, not exceeding the quantity of a Hedgehogge, and of a compounded fashion, betwixt a mouse and a Beare. But we haue shewed already, that this is the Alpine mous, and therefore wee will not stand to confute it here. The name Crycetus seemes to be deriued from the Illirian word, which we read in Gelenig to be Skuzecziek : this beast saith he, is common in the Northern parts of the world, and also in other places, in figure, and shape, it resembleth a Beare, in quantity it neuer exceedeth a great Sorex. It hath a short taile, almost like no taile, it goeth vpon two legs, especially when it is mooued to wrath. It vseth the fore-feete in steade of hands, The voracity of the Cri∣cetus. and if it had as much strength, as it hath courage, it would be as fiercefull as any Beare. For this little beast is not afraide to leape into the hunters face, although it can doe no great harme, either with teeth or nailes. It is an argument that it is exceeding hot, be∣cause it is so bold and eager. In the vppermost chap, it hath long and sharp teeth, grow∣ing two by two. It hath large and wide cheekes, which they alwaies fill, both carrying in, and carrying out, they eate with both, whereupon a deuouring fellow such a one as Sta∣simus a seruant to Plautus was, is called Crycetus, a Hamster, because he filleth his mouth well, and is no pingler at his meate. The fore-feete are like a Moulds, so short, but not altogether so broad, with them he digeth the earth, The making of his den▪ and maketh his holes to his den, but when he diggeth so far as he can∣not cast the earth out of the hole with them, then he carrieth it foorth in his mouth. His den within he maketh large, to receiue corne, and prouision of fruite for his susten∣tation, whereinto he diggeth many holes, winding and turning euery way, that so he may be safe both against beasts that hunt him, and neuer be killed in his den: And also if a man digge the earth he may find his lodging with more difficultie. In the haruest time he car∣rieth in graine of all sorts, and my Author saith, Neque minus in colligendo industrius, quam in eligendo, conseruandoque est astutus, optima enim reponit. He is no lesse industrious in the gathering of his prouision, then crafty and pollitike in the choice, and keeping it, for it laies vp the best; and lest that it should rot vnder the earth, it biteth off the fibres and taile of the graine, laying vp the residue amongst grasse and stubble. It lies gaping ouer his gathered graine, euen as the couetous man is described in the Satyre sleeping vpon his money bagges. It groweth fatte with sleepe like Dormice, and Conies. The holes into the caue are very narrow so that with sliding out and in, they wear their haire. The earth which commeth out of their holes doth not lie on heapes like mole∣hils, but is despersed abroad, and that it fittest for the multitude of the holes, and all the holes and passages are covered with earth: but that hole which for the most part she go∣eth out at, is knowne by a foote-pathe, and hath no hinderaunce in it, the other places at which she goeth out are more obscure and hid, and shee goeth out of them backwardes. The male and femal do both enhabit in one caue, and their younge ones being brought forth, they leaue their old den and seeke them out some new habitation. In the male there is this perfidity, that when they haue prepared al their sustenance and brought it in, hee doth shut out the female, and suffereth her not to approch nie it, who reuengeth his per∣fidiousnes by deccipt. For going into some adioyning caue, she doeth likewise perta e of the fruits which were laid vp in store by some other secret hole in the caue, the male neuer perceiuing it. So that nature hath wonderfully foreseene the pouerty of al creatures: neither is it o∣therwise amongst mē, for that which they canot do by equity, they perform by fraud. This also commeth in the speech of the common people, against one that wil thriue. The yong country wenches concerning this matter, do chaunt out a verse not vnpleasant, which I am contented to expresse in Iambickes, consisting of foure feet: Hamester ipse cum sua Prudens catus{que} coniuge Stipat profundum pluribus Per tempus antrum frugibus Possitque solus vt frui, Lectis aceruis hordei Auarus antro credulam Extrudit arte comugem Serua, inquit, exiens, foras, Coeli serena & pluuias, Sed foeminis quis insitam? Vincant dolis astutiam? Nouum parans cuniculum. Furatur omne triticum. Egens maritus perfidam Quaerit per antra coniugem, Nec se repellat blandulis Demulcit inuentam sunis, Ille esse iam communiae Seruata dum sinit bona. At perfidus multiplices Opponit intus obices. Rursus fruuntur mutuis Antris, cibis, amplexibus. This beast doth deuoure all kinde of fruite, His meate and foode. and if he be nourished in a house he eateth bread and flesh: he also hunteth the fielde mice. When he taketh his meate, he raiseth himselfe vpon his fore feete: he is also wont with his forefeete to stroake his head, eares, and mouth, which thing the Squirrell and the Cat doe also, and as the Beauer among∣est those creatures which liue as well by water, as by land: but although in his bodie he seemeth but small, notwithstanding he is by nature apt to fight and very furious be∣ing prouoked, with his carriage in his mouth: he beateth away with both his feete that which resisteth him, directly inuading his enemie: The anger & furie o this beast. In the spirite and assaulting of his mouth he is wayward and threatning, from whence our countreymen were accustomed to say of any one which was angry, he breatheth his wrath out of his mouth like a Ham∣ster: Dis spruest vuie ein hamster : neither is he easily affrighted although he be far vne∣quall vnto those in strength with whom he is in combate. Wherefore some doe giue it in the place of a Prouerbe, that our Countreymen doe call a man which is madly rash Ein tollen hamster, as foolehardy, as a hamster. He flieth from any one that doth sharply resist him, and doth greedily follow after them that flie from him. I my selfe saw one of these who by assaulting a horse gat him by the nose, and would neuer leaue his holde vntill he was killed with a sword: He is taken by diuers meanes, Of the ta∣king of this beast. for he is expelled either by hot water powred into his den, or is choaked within, or being diged vp with a mattocke or spade he is killed; or by dogges. He is sometimes pulled out by the Foxe, or hurt: or oppressed by some snare a great waight being put about it, or to conclude he is taken by Art aliue, and that in the night time, when he goeth to seeke his prey, for in the day time for the most part he lyeth hid. Before his vsuall caue (as I haue said) he is taken by the path which is worne, by a pot which is put into the earth, and afterward made plaine about it like other places of the fielde: there is earth cast into the bottome of the pot to the deepenesse of two fingers, aboue euery where couering the pot there is placed a stone, which is helde vp by a peece of wood, to which there is bound below a fragment of bread: In the space betweene the caue and the pot there are crumes of bread scattered, which he following and leaping in∣to the pot, the wood falling he is taken. Being taken after the manner of other beastes, he toucheth no foode. If a broad stone, such an one with which they couer pauementes, or of which they make roofe-tiles shall be ioyned vnto the pot, and the beast be taken, he will be very hardly knowne in the morning, for the spirit of the beast being shut in, and waxing wroth, pearcing for thinesse doth moisten the stone. The skins of Hamsters are ve∣ry durable, of which there are certaine long coates which come downe vnto the heeles and diuers coulored cloakes made, which the woman of Misena and Silesia doe vse, The vse of their skins. and account them very honorable, of a blacke and red coulour, with broad gards or edges of the skinnes of Otters: the same coates are for the most part vallued at the price of fifteene or twentie Renensian crownes: for it doth out-weare in length three or foure garments made either of linnen, or wollen cloath. In Turingia and Misena this beast is frequent, notwithstanding not in all places, for in Turingia his chiefest abode is about Efurdanus, and Salcensis in Misena, about Lipsia, and the field Pegensis, the plentifullest and most fertilest places of both those regions. In Lusatia about Radeburge he is diged out of the places where painick groweth. At Mul∣berge and Albis, he is found in the Vine-yardes, for he is also fed with ripe grapes. Our countrey-men are wont to burne a liuing Hamster in a pot being shut for the medicines of horses. It hath beene seene that one of these hath leaped vp and caught a horse by the nose, neuer letting goe his hold vntill she was cut off with a sword. The skin is of three or foure different colours, besides the spotted sides, and therefore the skinne is very pretious. They abound in Turingia where the soile is good, and there is also great store of graine. OF THE NORICIAN MOVSE. T He Morician mouse is called in Latine Citellus, and it kee∣peth like the wilde mice in the caues and dens of the earth. The name, description and di positi¦on. The body is like to a Domestical Weasils, long & slender, the taile very short, the coulour of the haire like to a gray Conies, Agricola. but more bright. It wanteth eares like a mole, but it hath open passages insteade of eares, wherewithall it hea∣reth the sound, as you shal see in many birds. The teeth are like the teeth of mice, and of their skinnes (although they be not very precious) they vse to make garments. In Germany they cal it Pile and Zisel, and of this Germaine word was the Latine Citellus feigned; and it appeareth by Agricola, that there are two kindes of these; one greater, which are cald Zysell and Zeiseile, and another lesser (called Pile ) which may be the same that is also called Bilchmuss, Genelius. and differeth from other, because it is vsed for meat. These are bred in Croatia, and in the countrey about Vennice. They haue a strange smel or savour which is said to be hurtful to the head: They eat both salted and hung in the smoke, and also fresh and new killed. With their skins they edge the skirts of garmentes, for it is as soft as the skin of a Hare: and beside the common nature of mice they are ta∣med. They also haue very large cheekes, whereinto they gather an innumerable quantitye of graine, and carry it into their den, as it were in bagges against the Winter. They liue thirty and fourty together in a caue, and are not driuen forth but by infusion of hot water. They gather great store of Nuts into their caues, and therefore aswel as for their flesh do men hunt and seeke after them. OF THE MOVSE PONTIQVE Olaus mag: Agricola T He name of this mouse is giuen vnto it from the Island out of which it was first brought, named Pontus, and for this cause it is also called Fenicus, because it was first of al brought into Germany from Venice. It is called also Varius by Idorus, from whence commeth the Ger∣man word Vutrck, from the diuersity of the colour Graeu vuerck. It is cald also Pundtmuss, as it wer Pōticus mus, or rather, of Bundt, because they wer wont to be brought in bundles to be sold fifty togither, and they were solde for twenty Groates, Volaterranns, and Hermol us are of this opinion, that the white ones in this kinde, bee called of the Italians Ar∣mellines, and by the Germaines Hermelin, but wee haue promised already to prooue that Hermelin is a kind of Weasell, which in the winter time is white, by reason of extrea∣mity of cold, and in the summer returneth into her colour again, like as do the Hares of the Alpes. This Pontique Mouse differeth from others onely in colour, for the white is mingled with ash colour, or else it is sandy and blacke, and in Pollonia at this day they are found red and ash-colour. Their two lower most teeth before are very long, & when it go∣eth, it draweth the taile after it like mice, when it eateth it vseth the forefeet instead of hāds, and feedeth vpon Walnuts, Chesnuts, Filbeards, smal Nuts, Apples, and such like fruits. In the winter time they take sleep instead of meate: And it is to bee remembred, that the Polonians haue foure kinds of pretious skins of Mice which they vse in their Garmentes, distinguished by foure seuerall names. The first of grisell colour called Popieliza. The se∣cond is called Gronosthaij, a very white beast all ouer, except the tip of the taile which is al blacke, and this is the Hermelin. The third is called Nouogrodela from the name of a Towne, and this is white mingled with grisell, and this is also a kind of Pontike Mouse. The 4. Vuieuuorka, of a bright Ches∣nut colour, and this is the Squirrell, for they call Squirrels, Weasels, and Hermelin al by the name of mice. These Pontique Mice haue teeth on both sides, and chew the end. In the winter time as we haue said they lie and sleepe, especially the white ones, and their sence of tast doth excel al other (as Pliny writeth,) they build their nests and breed like com∣mon Squirrels. Their skins are sold by ten together, the two best are called Litzschna. the 3. a little worse are called Crasna, the 4 next to them Pocrasna, and the last and vilest of all Moloischna : with these skins they hem and edge garmentes, and in some places they make canonicall Gar∣ments of them for priests, vnto which they few their tailes to hang downe on the skirts of their garments; of which custome Hermolaus writeth very excellently in these words. In∣struxit, & ex muribus, luxuriam suam vita, alios magnis frigoribus, alios medio anni tempore, a septentrionibus petendo, armannus corpora, & de bellamus animos. That is to say, The life of man hath learned to be prodigall euen out of the skins of Mice, for some they vse against extremity of cold, and they fetch others out of the farthest Northern parts, for the mid∣dle part of the yeare: Thus do we arme and adorne our bodies, but put downe and spoyle our minds. Beside, there is a flying Ponticke or Scy∣thian Mouse, which we may call the broad-Squerrell-Mouse, whose skinne is heer ex∣pressed as you may see, and for the discrip∣tion thereof, I haue thought good to adde an Epistle of Antonius Schnebergerus the Lituanian of Vilna vnto Gesner, in these wor¦des following: I send vnto thee a little skin, the vpper place of the haires thereof being of a white ash-colour, but the roote of the haire or in∣ner part thereof, is a blacke broune. They call it Popyelycza Latayacza, that is, A Pontique-flying-Mouse: It is alwaies so moyst, that it can neuer be dressed by the Skinner, or Lether-dresser. The people vse it to wipe sore running eies, hauing a perswasion that there is in it a sigular vertue for the easing and mitigating of those paines: but I thinke that the softnesse was the first cause which brought in the first vse thereof, but if the haires do not cleaue hard to the skin, it cannot be done without danger. Also the haires hanging as it were in a round cir∣cle against or aboue the two former feete, they call wings, wherwithall they are thought to fly from tree to tree. Thus far Antonius▪ Gesner after the receite of these skins, being wil∣ling to preserue them from mothes, because they were raw, for experience sake gaue them to a leather dresser, who presently dressed them with Vineger and the Leese of Wyne, so that it appeareth the Skinners of Littuania had not the skill how to dresse it. After they were dressed they were so softe that they stretched aboue measure, so that euery one of them were square, that is to say, their length and breadth were equall, for they were two palmes or eight fingers broade: and no more in length, the head and taile excepted, wherefore it may well be called a square Mouse, or Sciurus quadratus, be∣cause we are sure of the former, but not of the flying; the taile was as long as foure or fiue fingers are broad, being rough like the taile of other Squirrels, but beset with blacke and white haires, the whole colour both of the belly and vpper parte was whitish as we haue said, but blacke vnderneath, the haire is so soft as any silke, and therefore fit for the vse of the eies. The eares shorter and rounder then a Squirrels, the feete did not appeare by the skin: the neather part was distinguished from the vpper part, by a certaine visible line, wherein did hang certain long haires which by their roughnes and solidity vnder the thin and broad frame of their body, might much help them to flie, euen as broad fishes swim by the breadth of their bodies, rather then by the help of their sins. The Heluetians wear these skins in their garmentes. It is reported by Aelianus, that the inhabitantes of Pontus by making supplication to their Gods, did auert and turn away the rage of Mice from their cornfieldes, as the Egyptians did, as we haue said before in the story of the vulgar Mouse. OF THE MOVSE CALLED the Shrew, or the erd-Shrew. T He word Hanaka of the Hebrewes remembred in the II. chap. of Leuitticus, is diuersely interpreted by the transla∣tors, some cal it a reptile beast which alwaies cryeth: some a reptile-flying-beast, some a Horse-leach, or bloud-suck∣er, some a Hedghog, and some a Beauer, as we haue shew∣ed before in the Hedghog. But the Septuagints translate it Mygale, and S. Ierom Mus araneus, that is, a Shrew. Dio∣scorides calleth it Miogale. The Germans and Heluetians cal it Mutzer, in some partes of Germany, from the figure of the snout it is called Spitzmus, by some Zissmuss, from the fiction of his voice, and some Gross Zissmuss. The Hollanders call it Moll musse, because it resembleth a Mole. Mathaeolus for the Itali∣ans cal it Toporagno, that is a Mole-Shrew. The Heluetians cal it Bisem-muss, that is a Muske∣mouse, because it being dryed in a furnace smelleth like muske. The skin pulled from the flesh, smelleth best by it selfe, and yet the flesh smelleth well also, and so doe the excre∣ments. But to returne to the Greeke name why it should be cald Mygale, there is not one opinion amongst the learned: but I do most willingly condescend to the opinion of Ae∣tius, who writeth that it is called Mygale, because in quantity it exceedeth not a Mouse, and yet in colour it resembleth a Weasell, and therfore it is compounded of two words Miss, a Mouse, and Galen, a weasell. Amyntas is of opinion that it is so called, because it is begot betwixt a Mouse and a Weasel, but this is neither true nor probable. For it is likely that Weasels and Mice will couple together in carnall copulation, whose natures are so contrary, the one liuing vpon the death of an other, that is the wea∣sell vpon the Mouse? And beside the difference of quantitie betwixt them, maketh it im∣possible to haue such a generation. The other deriuation of Migale, which is made by Rodolphus writing vpon Leuiticus, fetching Mygale from Mus gulosus, that is, a deuouring Mouse, it is against the order of all good Linguists, to deriue Greeke words from Latin, but rather consonant to learning, to fetch the Latine from the Greeke. There is no lesse inquiry about the Latine name, whye it should be called Mus ara∣neus, seeing aranea signifieth Spider. This Mouse saith Albertus, is a red kinde of Mouse hauing a small taile, a sharpe voice, and is full of poyson, or venome. For which cause Cats doe kill them, but doe not eate them. Sipontinus writeth thus, of this Shrew. Mus ara∣neus, exiguum animal, at{que} leuissimum est, quod arane modo tenuissimum fiium, & gladij aciem concendit. That is to say, this Shrew mouse is a little and light creature, which like a Spider climeth vp vpon any small threed, or vpon the edge of a sword: and therefore you see, they deriue the Latin name, from his climing like a Spider. But in my opinion it is more reasonable, to deriue it from the venome and poyson which it containeth in it like a spider. For which cause Syluaticus writeth thus, Mugali id est, draco marinus, & animal venenosum, pusillum muri simile: nam & araneum piscem, propter venenum pungentibus insitum spinis, veteres ophim, id est, serpentem nominarunt, & hodie quam vulgo draconem vel dracenam. That is to say, there is a fish of the Sea, and a little beast on the earth like a Mouse, which by a generall word are called Mugale, and the spider fish called at this day a Dragon, or Dragonist, was in auncient time called a Ser∣pent, because by his prickly finnes, he did poyson those which were strucken by him. And concerning the description of this beast, it may be taken from the words of an aun∣cient English Phisition, called Doctor William Turner. I haue seene (saith he) in England, the Shrew-Mouse of colour blacke, hauing a taile ve∣ry short, and her snout very long and sharp, and from the venomous biting of this beast, we haue an english prouerb or imprecation, I be shrow thee, when we curse or wish harm vnto any man, that is, that some such euil as the biting of this Mouse may come vpon him. The Spaniardes call this beast Raton Pequenno, the Illirians Viemed kamys, and the Polo∣nias Kerit. They were wont to abound in Britany, as Hermolaus writeth. They are also plentifull in Italy beyond the mountaines Apenine, but not on this side (as Pliny writeth) yet in the hither partes of Italy and Germanie, there are many founde, especially in the countrey neere Trent, in the valey Anania, where this is admirable, that by reason of the coldnes of that countrey their bitings are not venomous. Samonicus. For the Scorpions there are not venemous, although in other places of Italy they poison deepely. This beast is much lesse then a Weasel, and of an ash colour, Ʋegetius. Aetius in most places like a mouse, although the colour be not alwaies constant. The eyes are so smal, and beneath the proportion of her body, that it hath not been vn∣iustly doubted of the auncientes whether they were blinde or no, but in their best estate their sight is very dul. And for this cause the auncient Egyptians did worshippe it: for as they held opinion that darkenes was before light, so they deemd that the blind creatures were better then the seeing. And they also beleeued that in the waine of the moone the li∣uer of this beast consumed. It hath a long and sharpe snowt like a Mole, that so it may be apt to dig. The teeth are very small, but so as they stand double in their mouth, for they haue foure rewes of teeth, two beneath, and two aboue, which are not onely apparant by their desection or anatomy, but also by their bitinges, for their wounds are Quadruple, wheresoeuer they fasten their teeth. Their taile is slender and short. But the description of this beast was better apprehended by Gesner at the sight of one of them, which hee rela∣teth on this manner. The colour (saith hee) was partly red, and partly yellow, mingled both together, but the belly white. The hinder feet seemeth to cleane to the body or loines. It smelleth strong∣ly, and the sauour did bewray or signifie some secret poyson. The taile about three fingers long, beset with little short haires. The residue of the bo∣dy was three fingers long. The eies very small and black, not much greater then Moles, so that next to the Mole they may iustly be caled, the least sighted creatur among al four-footed-beasts, so that in old age they are vtterly blind by the prouidence of God, abridg∣ing their malice, that when their teeth are growne to be most sharp, and they most full of poyson, then they should not see whome nor where to uent it. They differ as we haue said in place and number, from all foure-footed-beasts, so that they seeme to be compounded and framed of the teeth of Serpents and mice: The two foreteeth are very long, and they do not growe single as in vulgar mice, but haue within them two other small and sharpe teeth. And also those two long teeth grow not by them∣selues as they do in other mice, but are conioyned in the residue, in one continued ranke. They are sharpe like a saw, hauing sharpe points like needles, such as could not be seene by man, except the tips of them were yellow. Of either side they haue eight teeth, where∣as the vulgar mice haue but foure, beside the two long foreteeth, which also seeme deui∣ded into two or three, which except one marke diligently, hee would thinke them to bee all one. 2. Arnoldus. It is a rauening beast, feygning it selfe to be gentle and tame, but being touched it bi∣teth deepe, A ia us. and poisoneth deadly. It beareth a cruell minde, desiring to hurt any thing, neither is there any creature that it loueth, or it loueth him, because it is feared of al. The cats as we haue saide do hunt it and kil it, but they eat not them, for if they do, they con∣sume away in time. They annoy Vines, and are sildom taken except in cold, they frequent Oxe-dung, and in the winter time repaire to howses, gardens and stables, where they are taken and killed. If they fall into a cart-road, they die and canot get forth againe, as Marcellus, Nicander, and Pliny affirme And the reason is giuen by Philes, for being in the same, it is so amazd, and trembleth, as if it were in bands. And for this cause some of the ancients haue pre∣scribd the earth of a cart-road, to be laid to the biting of this mouse for a remedie therof. They go very slowely, they are fraudulent, and take their prey by deceipt. Many times they gnaw the Oxes hooues in the stable. They loue the rotten flesh of Rauens, and there∣fore in France when they haue killed a Rauen, they keepe it till it stinketh, and then cast it in the places where the Shrew-mice hanteth, whereunto they gather in so great number, that you may kil them with shovels. The Egyptians vpon the former opinion of holines, do bury them when they die And thus much for the description of this beast. The suc∣ceeding discourse toucheth the medicines arising out of this beast, also the cure of hir ve∣nemous bitings. Marcellus The medicines of the Shrew. The Shrew, which falling by chaunce into a Cart-roade or tracke doth die vpon the same, being burned, and afterwards beaten or dissolued into dust, and mingled with goose greace, being rubbed or annointed vpon those which are troubled with the swelling in the fundament comming by the cause of some inflamation, doth bring vnto them a wonder∣full and most admirable cure and remedie. The Shrew being slaine or killed, hanging so that neither then nor afterwards she may touch the ground, doth helpe those which are grieued and pained in their bodies, Pliny with sores called fellons, or biles, which doth paine them with a great inflammation, so that it be three times inuironed or compassed about the partie so troubled. The Shrew which dyeth in the furrow of a cart-wheele, being found and rowled in potters clay or a linnen cloth, or in Crimson, or scarlet-wollen-cloth, and three times marked about the impostumes, Pliny which will suddenly swell in any mans body, will very speedily and effectually helpe and cure the same. The taile of a Shrew being cut off and burned, and afterwards beaten into dust, and applied or annointed vpon the sore of any man, which came by the biting of a greedy and rauenous dogge, will in very short space make them both whole and sound, so that the taile be cut from the shrew when she is aliue, not when she is dead, for then it hath neither good operation, nor efficacy in it. The former hoofes of a horse being scraped, Hippocrates. and the same fragmentes or scantlinges thereof being beaten in the duste or earth ▪which hath been digged vp by a Shrew, in foure measures of water, powred downe the mouth of a horse which is troubled with any paine or wringing in his bowles, will soon giue him both helpe and remedie. The Shrew being either applyed in drinke, or put in the maner and forme of a plaister, or hanged vpon the sore which he hath bitten, is the most excel∣lentest, and most medicinable cure for the helping and healing thereof. A preseruatiue against poison, would be an excellent remedy, that neither man nor any other liuing crea∣ture, should be bitten if they should leaue or would want that superstition called an en∣chantment against poison, being hanged about the necke, whereof we will speake more in the curing of the bites of this beast. That the biting of a Shrew is venomous, and of the reason of healing in this kind. In Italy the biting of a Shrew is accounted for a very strong poyson, and that except there be some medicine very speedily applyed for the curing and healing thereof, Pliny the par∣ty so bitten will dye. These Shrewes are truely so venemous and full of poyson, that being slaine or killed by Cats, whose nature is to kill whatsoeuer Mice they take, they will not offer to touch or eate the least part of them. But the biting of a female Shrew is most obnoxious and hurtfull when she is great with young, but most dangerous of all when she biteth any one which is great with young, either a woman, or any other beast whatsoeuer, her self being also with young, Marcellus. for then it will hardly be cured. If a Shrew shall bite any creature while she is great with young, the pushes or biles will in time be broke which they make, and will come vnto a very great and malignant wound and sore. If the Shrew do also bite any creature during the time she is with young, Dioscorides she will presently leape off, notwithstanding shee biteth more dangerous. There is no∣thing which doth more apparantly explane and shew the biting of a Shrew then a certaine vehement paine and griefe in the creature which is so bitten, as also a pricking ouer the whole body, with an inflamation or burning heate going round about the place, Auicenna and a fiery rednesse therein, in which a blacke push or like swelling with a watery matter, and filthy corruption doth arise, and all the partes of the body which doe ioyne vnto it seeme blacke and blue with the marueilous great paine, anguish, and griefe, which ariseth and proceedeth from the same. When the push or bile which commeth by the occasion of a Shrew cleaueth or is bro∣ken, their proceedeth and yssueth forth a kinde of white flesh, hauing a certaine rinde or skinne vppon it, and sometime there appeareth in them a certaine burning, and some∣times the same is eaten in and falleth out, but in the beginning there is a most filthy greene corruption and matter which floweth in the same, afterward it is putryfied, Dioscorides and eaten in, and then the flesh falleth forth: the wringings also of the inward partes, the difficulty of voiding of the vrine, and a cold corrupted sweate, doth follow and accompa∣ny the same. But Auicenna affirmeth, that in what place soeuer this beast shal bite, the sores there∣of, with great anguish will pant or beate, and that in euery hole wherein his venomous teeth haue entred, there will a certaine fiery rednesse appeare, the skinne whereof being broken, there will come a very white and matery sore, which will breed much paine and trouble in all the partes of the body for the most part. The sores or woundes which are made also by this beast are very manifestly knowen by the markes of the fore-teeth stan∣ding all in a row together, as also by the blood which yssueth from the wound, Aeginetta being at the first pure, cleare, and exceeding red, but afterwardes corrupt, blackish, and full of putrifaction. There do also diuers bunches arise in the flesh vsually after the biting of this beast, which if any man shall breake, he shall see the flesh which lyeth vnder them corrupted, and de∣uided with certaine cleftes or rifts in the same. Moreouer the nature of this beast is such, that for the most part he doth couet to bite those whom he can come vnto by the stones or genitall, Auicenna. not onely men, but also all other brute beasts whatsoeuer: and thus much shal suffice concerning the biting of this beast. Wormewood being beaten or bruised smal, straynd in a fine linnen cloth, and ming∣led in Wine, Dioscorides. giuen to the party either man or Woman in Wine to drinke who is bytten by a Shrewe, will procure him present ease and remedy. The same also is an excellent remedy for the bitings or stingings of a Sea-Dragon. Vinegar is very me∣dicinable for the bitings of the Shrew and of Dogs, as also for the Fish called by the La∣tines Scolopendra, Pliny. (which voydeth all her bowels out vntill the hooke come forth, where∣with she is taken, and then sucketh them vp againe) the Scorpion and all other venemous Serpents. But the Graecian Physitians affirme, that the same ought to be mingled with other Medicines for the helping of the aforesaid diseases, as to take the ashes of the Shrew be∣ing burnt, the Gumme or liquor of the Hearbe called Fennell-giant, dryed barly beaten into small powder, Mustard-seede pounded small with the Hearbe called Purple, or Mothmullein, and mingle them altogether with Vineger, and being so applyed they will presently cure the aforesaid stings or bitings. Garlike being bruised, and the iuyce thereof anointed vpon the place which was bitten by a Shrew, Auicenna. will presently expell the paine, and wholly cure the sore. For the expelling of the superfluities of the pairings of the dead flesh, growing round about the sore, being not cast away but remaining thereon. Take Cummin and couer the wound or biting therewith, Aetius. then apply Garlike being beaten into Oyle thereunto, and annoint the places about the sore, as also the sore it selfe very diligently, and in very short space of time it will cause the same to fall away of it owne accord. For the healing also of the bites of this beast. Take Garlike, the leaues of a figge tree, and Cummin, mingle them very well alto∣gether, Dioscorides. til they come to a mollifiyng or temperat substance, then take the same, and fashi∣on it in the forme or manner of a playster, and it will very speedily and effectually curethe sore. The seede or leaues of Cole-worts, being beaten together with vinegar, and the hearb cald Assafoetida, Geoponica. is very good and profitable to be applyed either to the bites of this beast or a rauening Dogge. The dung of a Dog being taken and annointed vpon either man or Horsse which hath beene bitten by a Shrew, wil bee an excellent remedy both for the curing and healing them of the same. The Hoofe of a Ramme being dryed, beaten into powder, and afterwards mixed with Hony, will be likewise very good for those which are bitten with the same beast, so that they be first tempered and fashioned in the manner of a playster, and then applyed thereunto. The little white stalkes which proceede from a blacke Fig being beaten with the leaues of the Hearbe called Mothmullein, Waxe, and Vineger, vntill they come vnto a mollifying iuyce or salue, will be an excellent remedy against the biting of the Shrew, being annointed thereupon. The young or tender stalkes of a wilde Fig tree, bee they neuer so few or small, being first steeped in Wine, then lapped in a leafe of the same Tree, and so applyed vnto the stings and bites of Scorpions, and the Shrew, will in very short time cure and heale the same. Pliny Prouided alwaies that the wound bee well and diligently bathed or washed, before any thing be put or applyed thereunto. Dioscorides, Auicenna, and Actuarus doe affirme, that the excellentest, and medicina∣blest cure for the bites of a Shrew is this, to take the Spleene of the same beast, and beate it together with Vinegar, and the Gumme called Galbanum, then to annoint it or rub it vpon the sore, and it will presently expell away all paine, and in some short space altoge∣ther heale it. Aetius. If the red bunches or Vlcers which doe vsually grow about the bites of a Shrew do fortune to breake, take very sharpe and strong brine or pickle, and rub it both about, and within the sore, and afterwardes apply barly being burned and beaten into small dust or powder thereunto, which medicine although it seeme somewhat grieuous and painefull, yet it is very good and profitable for the expelling either of the stinges of Scorpions, or the bites of the Shrew or rauenous dog. The genitall of a Hare being beaten into powder mingled with Vineger, Pliny and anoynted vpon the bites of a Shrew, doth speedily cure them. Wilde Mallows being mingled with those Mallowes that grow in the Garden, haue in them a very effectuall force and power to cure all stinges or venemous bitinges, especially of Scorpions, Shrewes, Waspes, and such like stinging creatures. The Shrew being cut and applyed in the manner of a plaister, doth effectually cure her owne bites. The Shrew being killed and annointed all ouer with Oyle, and durt, or mire, applyed vnto the Vlcers or red swellings which come by her venemous teeth, will very speedily procure them to breake. The Shrew being cut or beaten into small pieces, dryed into powder, mixed with Vineger, and fashioned in the forme of a plaister, will ve∣ry speedily and effectually cure the bites of a Shrew, whether she be great with young or not, so that they be well applyed thereunto. But there are some which do thinke it nothing conuenient to mingle the Shrew with any other thing whatsoeuer, but that it is onely after this manner to be applyed by it selfe as to take it barned or drie it, and then to pound it in powder, and so to sprinkle it in the wound or sore, which in very short time will easily heale it. The Shrew falling into the furrow of a Cart wheele doth presently dye: Aelianus the dust thereof in the passage by which she went being taken, and sprinkled into the woundes which were made by her poyson some teeth, is a very excellent and present remedy for the curing of the same. Mathaeolus alledg∣eth out of Nicander, that the durt which cleaueth vnto the Wheeles of a Chariot being scraped off and sprinkled into the bites of a Shrew, Aetius will be very medicinable for the hea∣ling of them, which thing he himselfe thinketh a meere fable, and not to bee beleeued. If the pimples or bladders which arise in the bites of a Shrew shall be thought conuenient to be broken, for the performing of the same, take the skinne of a baked or roasted Pom∣granate, and spread it vpon the aforesaid red pimples, as whot as possible may be suffered for some small time, and it will cause the vlcers to breake, and all the corruption to yssue forth. If it grow vnto an Impostume, Auicenna take the little berries or pellets which are within the Pomgranate, being very well baked, and apply them vnto the sore some short time, Aeginetta and they will very easily cure the same. Mustard-seede being mingled with Vineger, annoin∣ted vpon the bites of a Shew, doth very effectually heale them. A Moule being bruised in∣to small pieces, and applyed vnto the bites of a Shrew in the forme of a plaister, is a very excellent remedy for the curing of them. Pitch and trifoly being baked, and rubbed verye whotte vppon the bites of a Shrewe, is accounted a very medicinable cure: but it is requisite that this fomentation be giuen vnto none but such as are of a stronge and po∣werfull body, and are also able to endure paine. The liquor of the Herb called Southern∣wood being giuen in Wine to drinke doth very much profit those which are troubled, Dioscorides and pained in their limbs with the bites of Shrewes. Wormwood being vsed in the like manner, will cure those which are bitten by a Shrew. The genitall of a Lambe or Kidde being mingled with foure drams of the Hearbe called Aristologia or Hart-wort, and sixe drams of the sweetest Myrth, is very good and medicinable for curing of those which are bitten or stung with Shrewes, Scorpions, and such like vnemous Beastes. The leaues of Coleworts being dryed, mingled with flower, and tempered together, vntill they come into the form of a plaister, will very much help against the venemous bites of the Shrew. The seede of Colewortes, and the leaues of the same Hearbe being mingled with Vineger, and the Hearbe called Assa foetida beate or pounded together, do very well and speedily cure the bites of the Shrewes, Ruellius as also of a rauenous Dogge, if the same in due time be applyed thereunto. The liquor also of the leaues of Coleworts being giuen in any kind of drinke, is good and wholsome for the cu∣ring of the aforesaid bites or woundes. Dioscorides The Nuts of a young Cypres Tree being mixed with a certaine sirrep or potion made of Hony, Water, and Vineger, and afterwardes drunke, doth very speedily procure ease and help for those which are bitten by a Shrew. The roote of a white or blacke Thistle, being beaten or bruised and giuen in drinke, doth very effectually help or cure those which are bitten by a Shrew. The like vertue hath the Hearbe called Rocket in it, and also the seede thereof being giuen in any kinde of drinke. Aegenetta The gum or liquor which proceedeth from a kinde of Ferula being giuen in wine to drink, doth very much helpe and cure those which are bitten by a Shrew. The same vertue also in it hath the roote of the hearbe called Gentian or bitterwort, being giuen in wine to drink. One or two drams of the yoongest or tendrest leaues of the Laurell tree, being beaten small and giuen in wine to drinke, doth speedily cure the sores or woundes which are bitten by a Shrew: Ae ius the same being also vsed in the said manner, and giuen in some certaine potion vnto horses to drinke, doth quickly help and heale them. But there are some which before all other medicines doe commend this for the best, and chiefest, that is, Auicenna to take the iuice which proceedeth from the leaues of the laurell tree, & the leaues themselues, being moist and new growing and to boyle them in wine, and being once cooled to giue it to any which is bitten by a Shrew, and this will in very short space alto∣gether helpe them. A yoonge Weasell being giuen in wine to drinke, is accounted very medicinable for those which are bitten by a Shrew, Pliny or stung by a Scorpion, or any other venemous creature. The hearbe called Baltsamint or Costmary, the hearbe called Bar∣tram, Aegmetta or wilde Pellito, the hearbe called Betonie, the hearbe called water-minte, or water Cresses, the sweete and delicious gum called Storax, as also the hearbe called Veruin be∣ing each of them seuerally by themselues either giuen in wine to drinke, or applyed in the manner of a plaister or annointed vpon the bits, or wounds which come by the venemous teeth of a Shrew, Auicenna will very effectually cure the paine thereof. The biting of a field mouse or Shrew, is very troublesome, and grieuous to all labouring beastes, for instantly after her bitinges there doe little red pimples arise, and there is most daunger of death in those beastes which she biteth when she is great with yonog, for the aforesaid pimples will then presently breake, after which the beast so bitten will instantly die. The Shrew doth also kill some laboring beasts with poyson, Albertus as chiefly horses & mules but especially & for the most part mares, which are great with yong. There are some which do affirme that if horses, or any other laboring creature do feede in that pasture or grasse in which a Shrew shall put forth her venome or poyson in, Absyrtus they will presently die. In what place soeuer a Shrew shall bite in any creature it will be compassed with an exceeding hard swelling, the beast also being so bitten, doth expresse his griefe or sorrow with much paine, & straining his body doth likewise swell all ouer, his eyes doe in a manner weepe, the swelling in his body doth squize out matter, Hierocles or filthy putrefaction, he voydeth poyson out of his belly, and doth vomite all sustenance vp as soone as euer he receaueth it. If an Asse being great with yoong be bitten by this beast, it is a very great chaunce if she scape death. But if the Shrew doe bite any beast when she is great with yong it is knowen by these signes, or marks, there will certaine red pimples compasse the sore round about, and also spread themselues ouer all the body of the bitten beast, and will in short space destroy him, except there be procured some present remedy. The Normans in Fraunce do sup∣pose the Shrew to be a beast so full of venome, and poyson, that if he shall but passe ouer either an Oxe, V getius or a horse lying downe along vpon the ground, it will bring such a dange∣rous disease vpon them, that the beast ouer which she shall passe shall be lame about the loines, or shall seeme as if he were immoueable, and that he can be cured by no other meanes, but by the same Shrew, who either of his owne accord, or by compulsion must passe ouer the contrary side of the beast, and that then he will be cured, which thing I doe hold to be very vaine and not to be beleeued. For the curing of beastes which are bitten by a Srew, thou shalt boile the seede of Parsly together with Wine and Oyle, and thou shalt cut the place which swelleth with a Pen-knife, by which the poyson may issue forth, and the wound being pointingly pul∣led or torne may waxe rawe: Hippocrates if by these the inflammation doe waxe more feruent and hotte, thou shalt eate the sore with iron instruments burning with fier, taking away some part of that which is whole and sound: then shalt thou renew the wound with the iron instruments being gouerned rightly, by which the corruption may issue forth: but if that part doe chaunce to swell by the exulceration, thou shalt sprinckle Barley bee∣ing burned and dryed therein, but before you doe this, it is meete to ioyne the olde fatte. There is also another excellent medicine for the curing of the Shrew, which Startonicus himselfe doth much commend, which is this: to lance or scarifie the wound assoone as it is bitten, but especially if it be compassed with an inflamation, afterwardes to sprinkle salt and Vineger vp on it, then to encourage or prouoke the beastes the next day following by some sweet water or liquor to run or go some little iourny, first hauing anointed the sore with ful∣lers-earth being beaten small and mixed with vineger, and then daily to nourish or bath it with water which commeth from bathes where some haue washed themselues, Hierocles and this in very short time being so vsed will very wel and altogether cure the beast. Against the bi∣ting of a Shrew Garlike is accounted for an excellent remedy being mingled with Nitre, but if there shal be no Nitre to be had, mixe it with salt and Cummin, then to dry and beat them altogether into powder, & with the same to rub the places which are infected with the biting: but if the venemous wounds do chance to break, then to take barly being scorched or burned, and pound it into small powder, and steepe it in vineger, and afterwardes to sprinkle it into the wound: this medicine Pelagon affirmeth, will onely heale the bites of a Shrew, and that the griefe of the sore, by the vse of any other medicines doth rather en∣crease then decrease. The flower which is made of red Weat, the Hearbe called Dill, Vegetius the liquor or Rozen which runneth out of the great Cedar, and two pound of the best Wine being mingled altogether, giuen in a potion and poured downe the throate of any laboring beast which is bitten by a Shrew, will presently ease and cure him of his paine. There is also another potion for the curing of the bites of this beast which is this, to take cloues of Garlike being bruised small, salt, Cummin, and Wine, of each the like quantity, these being giuen to any beast to drinke, doth presently cure him, as also any man being annointed vpon the wound, but not giuen to drink. Hippocrates The hearbe called Narde or Pepper-wort being beaten to the quantity of two ounces and a halfe, and mingled with some sweete smelling Wine, will presently help any beast which is bitten by the Shrewe, being poured through his Nose, and his sore being at that instant time annointed with Dogs dung: the same is also very medicinable or wholesome for men which are troubled with the said biting. The bites of a Shrew being pricked with an Aule and annointed with dust which is found in the furrowes of Cartes vnder the markes or signes of the Wheele, being ming∣led with sharpe vineger, doth presently asswage the paine, and heale the sore. The earth-of the tract of a Cart also mingled with stale or vrine, being applyed vnto the bites of a Shrew, will very speedily cure them either vpon men or beastes. A Shrew being new kil∣led and rubbed ouer with salt, applyed vnto the wounds which she shal bite in any beasts, will instantly cure them: this vertue also hath the gall of a rere-mouse or Bat, being mix∣ed with vineger. Pliny There is a very good remedy against the bitinges of Shrewes, or to preserue Cattle from them, which is this, to compasse the hole wherein she lyeth round about, and get hir out a liue, and keepe her so till she dye, and waxe stiffe, then hang her about the necke of the beast which you would preserue, and there wil not any Shrew come neare them, and this is accounted to bee most certaine. And thus much shall suffice concerning the bi∣tings of the Shrewes, and of the cures thereof. OF WILDE FIELD-MICE. The Epithits of wild mice describing their kinds, T His wilde Mouse called by the Latines Mus agrestis, Mus Syluestris, Syluaticus, Subteraneus, and some say , (althogh I rather take that word to signifie a glare worm.) It is called also Exignus Mus, and Rusticus. The Graecians cal it Myss Arourayos, the Germans field-mouse, and erd∣mouse, that is a mouse of the earth, Nualmuss, and Nu l∣muss, Schorrmuss, Schoermowss, Stossmuss, and L ckmuss, by reason of her digging in the earth like a mole. The French call it Mullott. There is of these mice two kinds, a greater and a lesser. The picture of the greater we haue de∣scribed heare, forbearing the lesser, because in all partes it resembleth this, except in the quantity. Their seueral parts. This greater kind is not much lesser then a Rat, hauing a long broad taile like it. The eares of it are round. The head round and great, and the snout or chaps do not stand out long. They are of two colours in both kinds, some red and some blacke. They haue a beard betwixt their mouth and their eies, and the lesser mice haue a short taile. A Physitian ta∣king occasion of the writinges of Bassianus Landus to disect one of these mice, found it to be true which he saith, that their maw and guts lye al straight and vpright. We haue shew∣ed already, Whether Mice engen∣dred of the earth, can pro¦create other. Aelianus Pliny that all kind of mice are generated out of the earth, although also they suffer copulation. And in Egypt it is very common about the Thebaijs, and the places where Nylus ouer floweth, that in the decrease and falling away of the Waters, the sunne en∣gendereth many mice vppon the slime of the earth, so that it is ordinary to see one time their forepartes to haue life, flesh, and motion, and the hinder partes deformed, and no∣thing but earth. And about this matter there is some disputation among the Authors, for there bee Phylosophers which affirme, that euery creature as well perfect as vnperfect, may bee made both by seede and of putrified matter; and from hence came the opinion in the Po∣ets, of the sons and daughters of the earth, and so they say, that things grow by generati∣on in infinitum: Some say that perfect creatures cannot be generated in that manner, but the imperfect ones such as mice are, may bee ingendered by seed and putrifyed matter, and afterwards beget more of his owne kind. But Aristotle confesseth the first generation, and denyeth the second, and saith al∣though they do generate by copulation, yet it is not Idem sed animal spece diuersum, à quo nihil amplius gigni possit ; And therefore Ieronimus Gabucinus endeth this controuersie, saying. Mures ex putredine nati, generant quidem & ipsi, sed quod ex eis generatur, nec mus, est nec foemina: nec amplius generat, that is; Mice engendered of putrified matter do also engender, but that which is begotten of them is neither male nor female, neither can it engender any more, that it may not proceed in Infinitum, like a mouse engendered by copulation. But concerning the beginning of these wilde field-mice, and their encrease, The damage done by wild field-Mice Aristotle speaketh in this manner: we haue receiued (saith he) the wonderfull generation of wilde fielde-mice, abounding in euery place, and especially in corne fields, which by their multitude, do instantly eat vp and deuoure a great deale of graine, insomuch as it hath bin seene, that diuers poore husbandmen, which haue determined to day, to reape their corne on the morrow, in the meane season it was so destroyed by mice, that when the reapers came in the morning, they found no corne at all. And as the encrease of these mice was extraordinary, so also was the destruction, for men could not driue them away, as in former times by smoking them, or else by turning in swine to roote out their nests from the earth, or by sending Foxes, or wild-cats among them, but their multitude did alwaies preuaile, and yet after a fewe dayes, the showers of the cloudes destroyed them. And Pliny saith, that this ought to bee no meruaile, that there should be so great a haruest and store of these mice, seeing that men yet neuer knew how to hinder their generation, or to kill them being engendered, and yet for al that they are sildome found in the winter time either aliue or dead. And seeing that we haue entred into the mention of the damage of these wilde field-mice, it is profitable to set down some stories out of Authors, recording the place and persons, whome they haue verye much annoyed. Pliny writeth, as we haue shewed in our former discourse, that the inhabitants of Tro∣as, were driuen from their habitation by these field-mice, because they deuoured al their fruits, & when they died ther was a worm engendred in their heds. Diodorus Siculus in his fourth booke of auncient Monuments recordeth, that there were certaine people of Ita∣ly, which by incursion of fielde-mice were driuen to flight, and to forsake their patrimo∣nies, for they destroyed the rootes of the corne, like some horrible drought, or some vnresistable cold frost. Cossa a Towne of Vmbria in the daies of Pliny, which at this day is called Orbi tellus, was destroyed by fielde-mice, (as Volatteranus writeth.) Niphus also saith, that hee sawe in one night, all the Corne-fieldes at Calenum destroyed by these mice. There are such a number of these mice in Spaine, that many times their destruction caused pestilent diseases, and this thing hapned amongst the Romaines when they were in Cantabria, for they were constrained to hier men by stipends to kill the mice, Strabo. and those which did kill them, scarse escaped with life. The inhabitants of Gyarus, an Island of the Cyclades, after they had long resisted the violence of these mice, yet at length they were faine to yeeld vnto them, and forsake their territory; and the mice after their departure, through hunger did gnaw the yron. Wee haue shewed already how the Plilistines were punished with mice, before they sent away the Arke of the Lorde, and howe the Aeolians and Troyans were annoyed with them, vntill they had sacrificed to Apollo Smintheus, and how the mice of Heraclea, at the time of Grape-gathering, doe go out of the country and returne againe in the Autumne. When Sanacharib, king of the Arabians and Egyptians, inuaded Egypt, it is said by Herodotus, that Vulcan in the night time sent vppon his armey such an innumerable swarm of wilde-mice, that before morning they had eaten assunder their Quiuers, Arrowes, Bowes, and all warlike instrmentes, so that the next day, for the want of weapons, and feare of their enemies, they were constrained to take their heeles and run away. And to conclude, by the same meanes the Calcidensians were driuen out of Elymnium, a citty of the mountain Athos, and thus much shall suffice for the harm of these mice. They make their dwellings and habitation in the earth, Places of their abode. according to this say∣ing of Virgill : Sape exiguns mus Sub terra posuit{que} domos, at{que} horria fecit. Yet now and then they come out of the earth, although it be but seldome. They heaue vp hilles like Mols, and they eate and deuoure the rootes of corne and Hearbes. They make not very deepe holes, but dig vnder the turfes, and vpper face of the earth, so that when a man walketh vpon it he may perceiue it by the sinking in of his footesteps: if the hole be opened with a Spade, they close it againe as a Mole doth, but not so speedily, for they defer it two or three daies together, and therefore if it be watched they may kill her at hir returne by treading vpon her; concerning the manner of taking them, these obseruati∣ons following may be put in practise. Driuing a∣way of these mice. These kind of Mice are driuen or chased away with the ashes of a Weasell, or of a cat mingled with water, and by sprinkling or scattering seede or corne abroade, or by some things well sodden in Water: but the poysoning of those Mice is in the sent or sauor of bread: Plinius. and therefore they thinke it more profitable to touch the seede or Corne lightly with the gall of an Oxe. Apuleus doth affirme, that to soke the graine or corne in the gall of an Oxe before you sprinkle it abroad, Paliadius is very good against these fielde-mice: also (as it is read in Geopon Graec. ) it doth very much commend the gall of Oxen, wherewith as he saith, if the seed or corne be touched, they shal be freed from the molestation or trouble of these field-mice. Notwithwanding in the Dog-daies Hemlock-seede ith the hearbe Hellebor is better, or with wilde cucumber, or with Henne-bane, or being beaten with bitter Almonds, and Bears-foot, and to mingle with them iust as much meal or corne, & beat and stamp them in oile, and when you haue so done, put it into the hollow places of these field-mice: and they wil die assoone as euer they shall tast of it. Auicen doth affirme also, that Hen-bane∣seede doth kill these kind of Mice, without the mixture of any other thing. Very many do stop the passages of them with the leaues of Rododaphne, who do perish in the time they are laboring to make their passage, by the gnawing of them. Apuleius also saith, that the people of Bithynia haue had much experience of these thinges, who stopped the passages of these mice with these Rododaphne leaues, so that they desire to come forth by touching the same often with their teeth: which truely so soone as they shal touch or come vnto, they shal presently dye. But they vse a kind of incantation which is this that followeth. I do adiure all ye mice which do remaine or abide heare, that yee do not offer me wrong, or suffer me to be wronged of any other. For I do assigne and ap∣point you this fielde, (then he nameth the fielde) in which if I should supprize you here∣after, I cal Luno to witnesse, I wil teare euery one of you into seuen pieces: when as thou hast write this charme, binde paper fast to the place wherein the Mice haunt, and that be∣fore the rising of the Sunne: so that the charecters or markes may appeare on the out∣side cleaning to a naturall stone of that place. I haue written this (saith the Author) lest any thing should seeme to be ouerskipped: neither doe I allow or proue such thinges can be done, but I rather counsell al men that they do not set their mind to any of these which are more worthy of derision then imitation. If thou shalt fill the passages of these rusticall or field-mice with the ashes of an Oak, he shall be possessed with a feruent desire to it, of∣ten touching it and so shall die. Marcellus. The medi∣cines of field mice. Scholiastes. These countrey Mice, that is to say those Mice which are founde in the fieldes, being bruised and burned to ashes, and mingled with fresh honey, doeth comfort or restore the sight of the eies by diminishing the darkenesse or dimnesse thereof, in what fielde soeuer you shall find any thing, dig them vp by the rootes with a little stake or post. OF THE WOOD-MOVSE. P Liny doeth oftentimes make mention of this woode-mouse or rather a Mouse belonging to the wood, The descrip¦tion. but he doth it onely in medicines; but that it doth differ from this country or field-mouse we haue shewen in the Chap. go∣ing before, because it doth not habit or dwell in Countries or tilled places, as the Countrey or field-mice doe, but doth inhabit in Woodes and forrests. The wood-Mouse is called in Greeke as the Countrey-mouse: but I thinke it to bee a kinde of Dor∣mouse, which proceedeth from the kind of wood-mouse. Pliny truely doth make the same remedy or medicines of a Dormouse, as he doth of a Wood-mouse, as I will a little after rehearse or recite vnto you. Also I should haue thought that a Sorex had bin the same, because it is a wood-mouse, but that, that one place of Pliny did hinder me, where he commendeth the ashes of a Wood-mouse to be very good for the clearenesse of the eies, and by and by after did shew or declare that the ashes of the Sorex were good also in the same vse, as I will recite or rehearse below in the medicines or remedies of the wood-mouse. Agricola a man of great learning, doth interpret or iudge the wood-mouse to bee that mouse, to the which they do appoint the name deriued from Auellana : but hee doth account that to be the Sorex, which I will shew or declare beneath to be the Shrew. I do vnderstand that there are properly two kinds of the wood-mouse spoken of before. The one of them that which Albertus doth write, saying that there is a certain kind of Mouse which doth builde or make her habitation in trees, and of a browne or swart colour, and hauing also black spots in her face, which onely is called by the vniuersal name of a wood-Mouse. Of the same kind Pliny doth meane, (if I be not deceiued) when he writeth, that the mast of a beech-tree is very acceptable to Mice, and therefore they haue good successe with their young ones. The other which is peculiarly named the Sorex, which (saith Pliny) doth sleep all the winter time, and hath a taile full of haire: whose shape or forme we pro∣pose and set euidently before you. But that I may more distinctly handle those thinges which Pliny hath shewed to vs concerning the wood-Mouse, I will write her downe sepe∣rately, or by it selfe, and afterwards concerning the Mouse which hath her name deriued from Filburds, which the Germans haue left in writing, and which I my selfe haue consi∣dered or obserued, and last of all I wil write concerning the Sorex peculiarly and seueral∣ly from the ancient writers. The ashes of a wood-mouse being mingled with hony, doth cure al fractures of bones, the braines also spread vpon a little peece of cloth, and couered with wooll is good also, The medi∣cines of the Woodmouse Pliny but you must now and then spread it ouer the wound, and it doth almost make it whole and strong within the space of three or foure daies: neither must you mingle the ashes of the wood-mouse with hony to late: hony also being mingled with the ashes of earth∣wormes, doth draw forth broken bones. Also the fat of these beastes, being put to kibes is very good, but if the vlcers are corrupt and rotten, by adding wax to the former things doth bring them to cicatrising. The oyle of a burned Locust is also very good, Marcellus and also the oile of a wood-mouse with Hony, is as effectuall as the other. They say also that the heads and tailes of Mice mixed with the ashes of them and annointed with Hony, doth restore the clearenesse of the sight, but more effectually being mingled with the ashes of a Dormouse or a Wood-mouse. Of the Nut-Mouse, Hasell-Mouse, or Fildburd Mouse. T His beast is a kind of Sorex, and may be that which the Germans tearme Ein, gros haselmus, a great Hasell-mouse, so called because they feed vpon hasell-Nuts, and Filburds. The Flemings call it Ein Slaperat, that is a sleeping Rat, and therfore the French call it by the name Lerot, whereby also we haue shew∣ed already, they vnderstand a Dormouse. For this sleepeth like that, and yet the flesh thereof is not good is to be eaten. The co∣lour of this Mouse is redde like the Hasell, and the quantity full as great as a Squirrell, or as a great Rat: vpon the backe and sides it is more like a Mouse, and vpon the head more red. His eares very great, and pilled without haire. The belly white, so also are his legs. The neather most of his taile towards the tip white. His Nostrils and feete reddish. The taile wholy rough, but most at the end with white haires. The eyes very great hanging out of his head, and all blacke, so that there is not in them any appearance of white. The beard partly white, and partly blacke, both aboue and beneath his ears, and about his eies, and the vpper part of his taile next his body all blacke. Vppon his forefeete hee hath foure clawes or distinct toes, for hee wanteth a Thombe. But vpon his hinderfeete he hath fiue, I meane vpon each seuerally. The outside of his hinder Legges, from the bending to the tip of his nails is altogether bald without haire. And the sauor of all this kind is like the smell of the vulgar Mice. They liue not onely in the earth, but also in trees which they climbe like Squirrils, and there∣fore make prouision of Nuttes and meate against the Winter, which they lodge in the earth. The Countrymen finding in the Summer their caues and dens, do wisely forbeare to destroy them, knowing that they will bring into them the best Nuts and Fill-herds can bee gotten, and therefore at one side they sticke vppe a certaine long rod, by directi∣on whereof in the Winter time they come and dig out the den, iustly taking from them both their life and store, because they haue vniustly gathred it together: Some haue eaten it, but they were deceiued, taking it for the Dormouse. OF THE LASCITT MOVSE. T His Mouse is called by the Germans Lascitts, and also Harneball, because of the similitude it holdeth with the Ermeline Weasell. The skinne of it is very pretious, being shorter then the Ermeline two fingers breadth. And for as much as else, there is no difference between the Lascitt Mouse and the Lascitt Weasell, except in the quantity. My opinion is that they are all one, and differ onely in age. And I am rather led to affirme thus much, because there are skinnes, annually brought to the Mart of Frankford, out of Polonia (cald Lascett, ) which are no other then the wea∣sels, of Nouo grodela, whose white skins are intermixed with griffeld, and thus much shall suffice to haue said of this Mouse. OF THE SOREX. Of the name and kind. I Am of opinion that this kind of Mouse belongeth to the Ha∣sell Mouse before spoken of, because it is wilde, hath a hairy taile, and sleepeth in the Winter, all which things are by Pli∣ny ascribed to the Sorex ; onely this hindereth, that he maketh the Sorex to haue rough hairy eares, and the Sorex of Germa∣ny hath bald eares. For answer whereof this shall suffice, that the other 3. notes being so great & pregnant, there is no cause why the want of one and that so litle as the haires on the eares, should depriue it of his naturall due and kind. The Italians and the French vse this word Sorex, Alunnus. for a domesticall vulgar Mouse, and so peraduenture did the ancients before them; but it is greater then the domesticall mouse, although Plinyes Sorex be neither greater nor lesser. The Spaniards call a Sorex, Sorace, or Raton Pequen∣no. The Illirians Viemegka Myss, by which word also they vnderstand a Shrew-mouse. The fibres of the intrals of this Sorex doe encrease and decrease with the Moone, so that the number of them do alwaies answer the number of the daies of her age. Her eares as we haue said are full of haires, but in the lowest part or tip thereof. The reason of her name is taken from the skreeching voice she maketh in gnawing. For it is a very harmefull biting beast, cutting asunder with her teeth like a sawe. Some doe deriue the Greeke word from Huras, which aunciently did signifie a mouse, and therefore they call this Syrax, and Saurex, but I list not to stand any longer vppon the name, seeing the beast it selfe affordeth little worthy matter to entreat of. It is reported by Varro, that in Arcadia there was a Hogge so fat, that a Sorex did eate into her flesh, and made her nest and brought forth young ones therein, which may very well be; for such is the nature of a fat Swine, that he will hardly rise to eate his meate, or ease himselfe of his excrements: And besides, fatnesse stoppeth sence, burying both the Nerues and Arteries very deepe: so that in the body of a man, his fattest part is least sen∣sible. Lycinius the Emperor going about to restraine the insolency of the Eunuckes and Courtiers, called them Ineas, Sorises{que} palatinos, that is mothes and Sorexes of the court. There was an auncient garment (as Pliny writeth) called Vestis soriculata, Egnatius. and this was very pretious in my opinion, because it was garded or fringed with the skinnes of the So∣rex. If this beast fall into any Wine or Oyle, she corrupteth the same, and it is to be re∣couered by the same meanes, as we haue formerly described in the vulgar Mouse. It should seeme there was great store of them in the daies of Heliogabalus, for he comman∣ded (as Iampridius writeth) to be brought vnto him, not onely a thousand of these beasts, but also a thousand Weasels, and ten thousand vulgar Mice, as we haue shewed before in the story of the vulgar Mouse. When the South-sayers were about their diuinatious, Pliny writeth, that if they heard the squeaking of a Sorex, they brake off, and gaue ouer their labour, holding it vn∣profitable to goe any further therein, and it is also reported, that the voice of this Mouse, gaue occasion to Fabius Maximus, to giue ouer his Dictatorship, and vnto Caius Flamin∣nius, to giue ouer the Mastership of the horsemen, such feare of silly beastes, was begot∣ten in the minds of gallant and magnanimious spirits, by the vnprofitable and foolish behauiour and doctrines of the Magitians. It is said by Nigidius, that these Sorises doe sleepe all the Winter & hide themselues like the Dormouse. They also when they eate any corne, do screetch and make a greater noise then other Mice, whereby they bewray themselues in the darke vnto their enemies, and are killed, which was the occasion of that prouerbial speech of Parmeno in Terrence, Ego me meo iudicio miser, quasi sorex perij. Saint Austine, and Saint Origine, doe also make vse of this prouerbe, the one in his booke of order, the other in a Homily vpon Genesis, which caused Erasmus to write in this manner, Sed videber ipse meis, iudicijs captus, that is, I haue ouerthrowne my selfe with my owne tale. These Sorices doe make hollow the trees wherein Emets or Ants breed, and there is perpetuall hatred betwixt the Bîttors, and these, one lying in waite to destroy the others yoong. The medicines of the Sorex. Serenus and Pliny, say that if a woman with child doe eate the sinnewes of a Sorex if her eies be blacke, so shall the infants be likewise; Si praegnans artus captiui Sorices edit Dicuntur foetus nigrantia lumina fingi. The fat of these beastes or of Dormice is very ptofitable against the Paulsie. The powder of the heads and tailes, annointed with Hony vppon the eies, restoreth the clearenesse of sight, and with hony atticke, the powder and fat of a Sorex burned, helpeth running eies, and the same powder mingled with oile, cureth bunches in the flesh. There is another mouse called by Mathaeolus, Mus Napelli, that is a Wolfe-baine∣mouse: so called, because it feedeth vpon the roots of that Hearbe, Of the mous called Mus Napelli. although there bee some of opinion, that it is not a creature, but another little Hearbe growing neare vnto it for a counter poyson. And Marcellus also maketh mention of Napellus, and Antinapellus, whereunto I should easily condescend, but that the eye-sight of Mathaeolus leadeth me to the contrary. For he writeth that he tooke one of them in the top of a high mountaine in ITALY▪ And Syl∣naticus calleth this mouse, Mus Suring, or Sucsinus, and calleth it a counter poyson to Wolfe-bane, and that God might shew thus much vnto men, he causeth it to liue vpon the rootes, in testimony of his naturall vertue, destroying poyson and venimous hearb . THE INDIAN MOVSE, AND DIVERS. other kinds of mice, according to their Countries. I Do finde that diuers times mice do take their names from re∣gions wherein they enhabite, which happeneth two maner of waies: one, because the forme of their bodies will somewhat vary: the other, because not onely in shape, but also in witte they haue some thinges in them common to mice, ouer and aboue the mice of our countreies, Mice of the Last therefore we will breefely comprehend al their surnames of whatsoeuer regions they are in one order or Alphabet. In the Oriental parts of the worlde, there are great mice, (as ALEXANDER writeth) of the quan∣tity of Foxes who do harme both men and beasts, and although they cannot by their bi∣ting kil any man, yet do they much grieue and molest them. Americ s Vespucius writeth, that he found in an ysland of the sea being distant from Vlis∣bona a thousand leagues, very great mice. Egyptian mice. The haire of the AEGYPTIAN mice is verye hard, and for the most part like a Hedgehogges: and there are also some which walk bolt vpright vpon two feet, for they haue the hinder legs longer, and their fore legges shor∣ter, their procreation is also manifold; and they do likewise sit vpon their buttockes, and they vse their forefeet as hands. But Herodotus affirmeth these mice to be of AFFRICKE, and not of AEGYPT; amongst the AFFRICAN or CARTHAGENIAN pastures (saith he) in AFFRICKE towards the Orient, there are three kinds of mice, of the which some are called Bipedall or Two-footed, some in the CARTHAGENIAN language Zetzeries, which is as much in our language as hils, some Hedg-hogges. Cyrenean mice. There are more kinds of mice in the CYRENAICAN region: some which haue broad foreheads, some sharpe, some which haue pricking haire in the manner of Hedge-hogs. It is reported that in CYRENE there are diuers kinds of mice both in colour and shape, Pliny. and that some of them haue as broad a countenance as a Cat; some haue sharpe bristles, and beare the forme and countenance of a viper, which the inhabitants call Echenetae, but improperly, as it appeareth by the words of Aristotle in his booke of wonders. Herodotus also affirmeth the like of those Mice, to be in shape and colour like Vi∣pers: but Pliny and Aristotle doe both disallow it, and say that in those iuice there is nothing common to vipers, but onely to hedge-hogges, as concerning their sharpe bristles. There are also some Mice in Egypt which doe violently rush vpon pastures and corne: of which things Aelianus speaketh, saying in this manner; when it beginneth first to raine in Egypt, the Mice are wont to be borne in very small bubbles, which wandring far and neare through all the fieldes doe affect the corne with great calumitie, by gnawing and cutting a sunder with their teeth the blades thereof, and wasting the heapes of that which is made in bundles, doe bring great paines and businesse vnto the Egyptians: by which it comes to passe, that they endeuor all maner of waies to make snares for them, by setting of Mice-trapes, and to repell them from their inclosures, and by ditches, and burning fires to driue them quite away: but the Mice as they will not come vnto the traps, for as much as they are apt to leape, they both goe ouer the hedges, and leape ouer the ditches. But the Egyptians being frustrated of all hope by their labours, all subtill inuention and pollicies being left as it were of no efficacie, they betake themselues humbly to pray to their Gods to remooue that calamitie from them. Whereat the Mice by some feare of a diuine anger, euen as it were in battell aray of obseruing a squadron order, A wonder in the Egyption Mice. doe de∣part into a certaine mountaine: The least of all these in age doe stand in the first order, but the greatest and eldest doe lead the last troupes, compelling those which are weary to follow them. But if in their iourney the least or yoongest do chaunce through trauaile to waxe wea∣ry, all those which follow (as the manner is in wars) doe likewise stand still, Aelianus and when the first begin to goe forward, the rest doe continually follow them. It is also reported that the Mice which inhabite the Sea doe obserue the same order and custome. The Africane Mice doe vsually die as soone as euer they take any drinke: but this is commonly proper vnto all mice, (as Ephesius affirmeth) where it is written, Medicine by african mice aboue con∣cercerning the poysoning of mice. Mice, (but especially those of Affricke) hauing their skinnes pulled off, boyled with oyle and salt, and then taken in meate, doth very effectually cure those which are troubled with any paines or diseases in the lunges or lights. The same doth also easily helpe those which are molested with corrupt and bloody spettings with retchings. The kindes of Affrican mice are diuers, some are two footed, Pliny some haue haire like vnto hedge-hogges, some faces of the breadth of a Weasell▪ but some call these mice Cirenacian, some Egyptian, as I haue before declared. The Arabian Mice. In Arabia there are certaine mice much bigger then Dormice, whose former legges are of the quantitie of a hand breadth, and the hinder of the quantitie of the ioynt to the ende of the finger: I doe vnderstand them to be so short, that nothing thereof may seeme to appeare without the body except the space of the ioynts of the finger, as it is in Martinets. It is said that the garments of the Armenians are vsually wouen with mice which are bred in the same countrey, The arme∣nian Mice. or diuersly docked with the shape of the same creature. The Author writeth, that Pliny maketh mention of the Armenian mouse, but I haue reade no such thing: therefore he doth perchaunce take the Armenian mouse for the Shrew. In Cappadocia there is a kinde of mouse which some call a Squirrell. Aelianus writing of the Caspian mice, Of the Ca∣spian mouse. Amyntas (saith he) in his booke entituled De mansionibus, which he doth so inscribe, saith that in Caspia, there doe come an infinite multitude of mice, which without any feare doe swim in the flouds, which haue great and violent currentes, and holding one another by their tailes in their mouthes (as it is likewise reported of Wolues) haue a sure and stable passage ouer the water. But when they passe ouer any tillage of the earth they fell the corne, and climing vp into trees, doe eate the fruite thereof, and breake the boughes: which when the Caspians cannot resist, they doe by this meanes endeuour to restraine their turbulent incursions, for they remooue all things which may hurt birds hauing crooked talents, who come pre∣sently so flying in such great flockes, or companies, that they may seeme to be clouds to expell the mice from their borders, and by a proper gif incident vnto them by nature, do driue away hunger from the Caspians, neither in quantity are these Mice inferior to the Egyptian Ichneumons: they are also vngentle, and they doe no lesse deuoure with the strength of their teeth, then the Mice of Teredon in Babilon do iron, whose soft skins the Marchants carry to the Persians. The Indian mouse, or Pharoes mouse, (as some learned later writers doe write) is no other then the Ichneumon. Antonius musa Brasauolus, tooke the before expressed figure of an Indian mouse, (for so he did cal it) which before that time was shewn by Bellonius, and I gessed it to be an Ichneumon ; and truely in the snout (if you take away the beard) and in the eares it doth agree, but in the taile it doth differ, which doth rather resemble a cats: and in many other things, which by conferring them are easie to be marked, and as I conceiued it, I haue set it downe. Of the Moschatte, or Mus-kat. THis beasts name is deriued from the hebrew word Bosem, which signifieth sweete odour, for the Germans call the same Bisem, & the beast it selfe Bisemthier. And the Graecians deriue their Mos∣chos of Moo, and ozo, to seeke, and to smell, and of Mesou Cheisthai, to proceed out of their middle; because the true liquor commeth out of the nauel, as we shal shew: but I rather think they deriue it from the Arabian words Mesch, and Misch, and Almisch. The Italians, French, and Spaniards vse Musci, and Muschi, which is deriued from the later Latins; and beside the Italians cal it Capriolo del Musco, & the French Cheureul du musch, the musk it selfe is called in Italy Mus∣chio, of the Latine Muschum, and Muscatum : the Illirians Pizmo, and the Germans Bi∣sem. The Arabians were the first that wrote any discouery of this beast, and therfore it ought not seem strange that all the Graecians and Latins deriue the name from them. And although there bee an vnreconcileable difference amongst writers about this matter, yet is it certaine that they come neerest vnto the truth that make it a kinde of Roe: for the figure, colour stature, and hornes, seeme to admit no other similitud, except the teeth which are like a dogs, wherof 2. are like a Boares teeth, very white and straight. And there be some (as Simeon Sethi, and Aetius ) which say he hath also one horn, but herein is a manifest error, bicause no man that euer saw one of these beasts doth so much as make mention therof; and therfore the original of this error came from the words of Auicen, who writeth that his teeth bend inward like two horns. Cardan writeth that he saw one of these dead at Myllan which in greatnes, fashion, and haire resembled a Roe, except that the hair was more thick, & the colour more gray. Now the variety of the haire may arise from the region wher∣in it was bred. It hath two teeth aboue, and two beneath, not differing absolutely from the Roe in a∣ny thing, except in the sauor. It is called Gazella, they are lesser, thinner, and more elegant creatures then the Roes are. Paulus Venetus writeth thus of this beast. The creature out of whom the muske is gathered, is about the bignes of a cat, (he should say a Roe) hauing grosse, thick haire like a Hart, & hoofes vpon his feet. It is found in the prouince of Cathay, and the kingdome of Cergoth, which is sub∣iect to the great king of Tartars. Likewise ther was a most odiferous musk cat at Venice, which a marchāt ther had to be seen, brought as he said out of Cathay, & for proofe whereof he shewed the way that he went, namely through the E xine sea, Colchis, Iberia, and Albania, euen to the entrance of Scythia. For the countrey Cathay is a part of Scythia, beyond Imaus, neither ought this to seem wonderful, for in that place there was a Region, called by Ptolomeus, Randa marcostra, wherein he placeth the e∣leuenth table of Asia. This region is watered by the riuer Sotus, and therein aboundeth spicknard, and the inhabitants cal the country wherein the best Muskats are bred, Brassauola Ergi∣mul, and the greatest citty of that Countrey Singuy. The same Authour writeth also, that Muskattes are brought out of Egipt, and out of many places of Affricke. In Thebeth also there are manie Cities, and beasts about those citties, cald Gadery, which do bring forth the muske, and the Inhabitants hunt them with Dogges. The prouince of Canicluet, doth also yeeld many of these beasts, and likewise Syria. S. Ierom also writeth thus: muscus & Oénanthe, & pegrigrini muris pellicula, by which skinne of the strange mouse, Tame musk cats. he meaneth the little bag, or skin wherin the muske of the Muskat is encluded. The princes of Europe do nourish these tame, being brought out of the new found worlde, and many other rich men especially in Italy, be delighted with the odorefirous sauor which commeth from it. ( Brassauolus saith) that he saw a Marchant offer one of these to be sold vnto Alphonsus du. of Feraria, which had the Nauel full of muske. And Catherinus Zenus, an auncient Noble man of Venice, had a Roe of this kind, which he left after his death vnto his heyres; and by this it doeth plainely appeare, that the Muskcat, is neither like a Catte, nor a mouse, and that al those which haue affirmed so much thereof, haue bin deceiued by their owne con∣iecturall deriuation of Moscus or Muscus, or by the errour of some writer of the auncient bookes, which instead of Magnitudo Capreoli à Roe, haue inferted Catti, a Cat. And thus much shal suffice for the description of this beast, and for the Regions wher it is bred, ex∣cept I may ad the relation of Ludovicus Romanus, who affirmeth, Their strēgth nimblenesse and quicknes Alex. Bene∣dictus that the muskats of Cale∣chut are brought out of the country Pegus. These Roes of the new found land are wonder∣ful nimble and quicke, and so swift, that they are sildome taken aliue, but after they are ta∣ken by pulling out their longer teeth they wax tame. When they are prosecuted with the hunters, and with Dogges, they defend themselues with their teeth. In some places they take them in snares, and in ditches, also kill them with dartes; and so hauing killed them, they cut off the little bagge wherein the muske groweth, for that muske doeth exceede in sweetnes of Odor all the thinges that were euer made by the art of man, Of the Musk and the vse thereof. and therefore the vse of it is more plentifull then of any other thinge, for they carry it about in Gat∣mentes. They make perfume of it; they annoint beades whereuppon they tell their prayers, they also make bals of it, and include it in Gold or Siluer, carrying it about, either to be seene, or because they are delicate and wanton, or to shew their riches and aboundance, or to preserue themselues from putrified and stincking ayres, or else against colde and moist diseases of the braine. With this the luxurious women perfume themselues, to en∣trap the loue of their wooers: for as the thing it selfe is a vice or sicknesse of the beast, so also by men it is vsed to vice and wickednesse; yet the Venetian matrons will neuer vse it, and he that beareth it about him shall neuer perceiue it himselfe. We haue shewed already, that it groweth in the nauell, The place where the Musk grow∣eth. or in a little bagge neere vn∣to it, and it is true by Gyraldus and Varinus, that when the beast beginneth to be luxuri∣ous, and prone to the rage of venery & carnall copulation, then the bloud floweth to the nauell, and there putteth the beast to paine, because it swelleth aboue measure. The beast then abstaineth from all meate and drinke, and rowleth himselfe vpon the ground, & so by the waight of his body presseth forth the humor that troubled him, which after a certaine time doth coagulate and congeale together, and then rendereth such an accep∣table sauor, as you see it hath. The relation whereof you shall heare out of the words of Serapion. In the wilde Roes (saith he) which wander too and fro in the mountaines freely, without the gouerment of man, haue in a little bagge, certaine putrified matter or bloud, which of it selfe groweth to be ripe, whereunto when it is come, the beast itcheth, and is pained as it were with launcing, therefore he rubbeth himselfe vpon stones, rockes, and trees, The naturall expression of Muske a great while together, for it delighteth him, wherby the stones grow white through his rubbing & therefore in time he weareth the bag a sunder, making issue vnto it for the corruptible matter to come forth, which presently runneth out vpon the sores, no otherwise then if it had bin launced. Then the wound groweth to be whole againe, and the beast departeth, vntil the like exsuperance of blood come into the same place againe. For euery yeare this happeneth them. The inhabitants of the country know al the hunters of these wild beasts, and there∣fore note them where they empty their bellies. For the humor so pressed out as before is declared through the heat of the sunne congealeth and dryeth vppon the stone, growing more commendable and pleasant through the Sunnes heat; Then come the inhabitants, and in little bottels made of the skinns of these beasts, which before they haue killed, and so put the muske into them. This they sell for a great price, because it is thought, (and that worthily) to be a gift fit for a king. But if this muske be taken out of the creature by violence, then wil hee bringe forth no more, yet expresse it by his own naturall art he beareth againe, and againe. The greatest cause of this humour, is the sweetnes of his foode, and the ayre wherein they are bredde, therefore if one of them be brought into this part of the worlde, with muske in his cod, it wil grow to ripenes in a temperate aire, but if it bee brought without muske in the cod, then it wil neuer yeeld any among vs: And besides that it liueth but a little while. And therefore my opinion is, that this excrementall humor, is vnto it like a menstruous purgation, for the want whereof it dieth speedily. Euery part of this beast is called muske which commeth forth of his vlcerous yssue, for although the other partes smell sweete, yet we will shew afterwardes, more at large, that it is not of themselues, but by reason of this humour. The pretiousnes of this thing deserueth a further treatise for thy better direction and instruction of the knowledge heereof, The best muske decla¦red by these seueral coun¦tries. both for the choice of that which is best, and for the auoyding and putting awaye of that which is adulterate. At Venice at this day it is sold in the cods, and the Indian muske is better then the Affrican. The browne is alwaies bet∣ter then the blacke, except it be of Catha, for that of Catha is blacke, and best of all. There is some that is yellowish, or betwixt redde and yellowe, after the verye same coulour of Spicknard; this also is of the best sort, because the beastes that render it, do feed vpon Spicknard. Syluius. Therefore this is good to be chosen, because it cannot be adulterated, and besides the tast of it is bitter, and as soone as euer it is tasted, it presently ascendeth to the braine, where it remaineth very fragrant without resistance, and is not easily dissolued. It is not bright within, Auicen. but muddy, hauing broad graines and equall throughout, like the wood of Baulme. But according to the regions, they chuse muske in this sort. Of the Indian muske, that of the Region of Sceni, (called Antebeuus, ) they set in the first place, and next vnto it, the beastes of the Sea side; The muske of Cubit is knowne by the thinne bladder of the beast wherein it is contained, Elluchacem. but that of Gergeri, is lesse Aro∣maticall and more thicke. The muske of Caram is in the middle place betwixt both, wher∣withall they mingle powder of Gold and Siluer, to encrease the waight. The muske of Salmindy is worst of all, because it is taken out of his blather or cod, and put into a glasse. There are some which preferre the Tumbascine muske, and they say, that the odor there∣of commeth from the sweete hearbes whereupon the beast feedeth: and the like is said of the Region of Sceni, but the odor is not equall to the other. And the Tumbascines, doe not gather the muske after the fashions of others: For they draw not forth this matter out of the cod, nor yet gather it in calme weather. The Cenians, they presse foorth the matter out of the ventricle, and when they haue it forth mingle it with other things, and that in cloudy and tempestuous weather: afterwards they put them vp in glasses, and stop the mouth close, and so they send it to be sold, vnto the Sarizines, and to Amanus, and to Parsis, and to Haharac, as if he were a Tumbescine, When this beast goeth furthest from the sea, and feedeth toward the desart vpon Spikenard, then is his muske sweeter, but when they feede neare the Sea, it is not so fragrant, because they feede vpon myrh. Auicen sayeth, there is some kinde of muske like a Citron, but such hath not been seene in this part of the world, for our muske is most commonly like the colour of iron, and the sauour of it, Serapto. like a Cirenian Apple, but stronger; and consisteth of little peeces, but it is better that hangeth together and hath a sauor of the wildernesse, but if it be adulterated with Snakes or Byrds-dung, then will it be lesser pleasant in the sauor, and also pinch and offend the nose. The hunters of Tebeth, and Seni, as we haue shewed already, do kil their sweet Rose, and afterwards take out from them their bladder of muske, which musk being exerped before it be ripe, smelleth strongly and vnpleasantly. And then they hang it vp a little while in the open and free ayre, wherein it ripeneth as it were by concoction in the sun, and ther∣by receiueth an admirable sweetnesse. And the like doe diuers Gardeners vse towardes Apples, and fruites of trees which are gathered before they be ripe. For by laying them vp in a dry place, they weare away their sharpnesse and become pleasant. But it is to be remembred, that musk is the best which doth ripen in his owne cod before it be taken out of the beast, for before it is ripe, it smelleth displeasantly. There is not much perfect muske brought into this part of the world, but the strength of it commeth from the vertue of the cod wherein it is put, and so it is brought to vs, but the best is brought out of the East, where groweth Spicknard and sweet Hearbs. Roderi∣cus Lucitanus saith that our muske is compounded of diuers things, the ground whereof is the bloud of a little beast like a Cony, which is brought out of Pegun a prouence of India. But the meanes whereby to try it may be this, after it is waied, they put it into some moist or wet powder, and after a little while they waigh it the second time, The tryall of Muske. and if it exceed the former waight, then do they take it for sound, perfect, and good, but if it doe not ex∣ceed, then do they iudge it adulterate. Some Marchants when they are to buy muske stop it to their noses, Simion Sethi Syluius and holding their breath run halfe a stones cast, afterwards they pul it from their Nose, and if they perceiue the sauor of the muske, then do they but it, and take it for good, but if not, they refuse it for corrupted. In some Churches they make perfumes with muske, and by mingling Stirax, Alloes, Amber, and iuyce of Roses, they make a perfume called Regium Suffimi∣gium, the Kings perfume; likewise vnto sweet waters, drawne out of the furnaces of Chy∣mis, whereunto they adde simple Rose Water, and for the richer sort of people muske and Camphory. Andreus Furnerius in his French booke of adorning mans nature, teacheth a composi∣tion to be made of certaine Oyles, Sope, and Muske, And also ointmentes and musked oyles. He also sheweth how to make little round bals of muske, and other confections, Platearius and afterwardes to draw a thread through the middle of them, and so weare them about ones necke. Some put it into silken wooll, through which they first draw a thread, and so dissolue it in rose water, afterwards make it vp in medicines, and vse it as aforesaid. It may be preser∣ued in a vessell of Lead, close stopped along time, for the lead which is cold and moist, The preser∣uing of musk a∣greeth well with the nature of the muske, & therfore if a leaden vessell be wanting, so as ye be forced to vse glasse and siluer, then must you put two or three pieces of lead into it, for the better preseruation, and couering the passage all ouer with wax, and aboue all things you must auoid al kind of spices, taking heede that no graine thereof come into it. If while it is in the vessell it lose the sauor and be dead, then it is to bee recouered by opening the mouth of the viall, and hanging it ouer a priuy, For when the stinke and euill sauer com∣meth vnto it, Contra foetorem eluctatur, & quasi luctando reuiuisset, it striueth against the filthy stinke, and as it were reuiueth in that contention, saith Isidorus, Albertus, and Platea∣rius. But concerning the adulterating of muske, I will say more in this place. Benedictus The adulte∣rating of muske & the meanes to de¦scry it. First of all the mountibanks do corrupt it by mingling with it the liuer of a calfe. Also by a roote called Makir, and an hearb Salich. Many times the dung of Mice is sold for musk, and so great is the deceit herein, that a man may not trust the outward shape of an intire codd, for there be imposters which can counterfeit them, and make them in all parts for the outward ap∣pearance, and fill them with certaine stuffe, interposing some little true muske among it vntill it haue a reasonable sauor, and therewithall deceiue simple people. It is also adulterated by mingling with it a litle Goates bloud fryed, or browne bread fryed, so that three or foure partes of these, will receiue seasonable tast from one part of the muske. It is also adulterated in the skin by putting peeces of the skin into it, and it may be knowne from the true muske, because it will waigh twice so heauy. The Sarazens vse this shift aboue all others, and there is one principall way of making coun∣terfet muske, which is this, they take Nutmegs, Mace, Cinamon, Cloues, Gilliflowers, and Spikenard, of euery one a handfull, all these being beate diligently together, and dryed and sifted, they are mingled with the warme bloud of a Doue, and afterwards dri∣ed in the Sunne, then are they seauen times sprinkled ouer, or moystened, with the Wa∣ter of muske-Roases, and betwixt euery sprinkling they are dryed; At length they min∣gle therewithall a third or fourth part of true musk, and then sprinkle it ouer againe with Muske-rose-water, so deuide it into three or foure lumps, and take the white haires from vnder the taile of a Roe or Kid, and so put it in a vessell of glasse. Benyuine, white-waxe taken out of a new Hiue of Bees, the rotten part of Eue-tree, and a little Muske, are mingled altogether to make a counterfeit Amber, for it will smell like ciuet, or muske, or else Stirax, and the powder of Lygnum-aloes with Ciuet, and Rose water, but the fraud in one & other is easily deprehended, for both the odor and the colour are different from the true Amber, and also it will sooner wax soft in water, then that which is naturall. Some do corrupt their Muske with the seede of Angelica, or rather with the roote of it, because the roote smelleth sweete like Musk, but the cosinage may be easily disco∣uered, by putting it into water. For the Angelica will sinke, and he Muske will swimme. The true Muske is sold for forty shillings an ounce at the least. It is also obserued by Ar∣noldus Villanouanus, that in the presence of Assafoetida or Castoreum, the best muske will haue a horrible and intollerable sauour, although they touch not one another which can∣not be ascribed to any knowne reason, but to some secret in nature. The sweetenesse of the Arabian muske is described by A ciatus in this verse; Et celebris suaui, est vnguine muscus Arabs. There be diuers Hearbs which smell sweete like muske, as Angelica, Dorsis, Muske-Gili∣flowers, Herbes resē∣bling muske. Muske-Grapes, the leaues of a winter Cherry, and an Hearbe growing neare Basill without a name, like wilde Parsley, the Damasine-rose, and many other. Wilde cats and Martins do also render an excrement much like muske, and there are Hares called Moschiae, which leaue such an intolerable smell in the impression of their footesteppes, that the Dogges by touching them growe madde, as wee haue shewed in the story of the Hare: And thus much for the description of this beast, now followeth the medi∣cines. The medicines of the Muske-cat. A very little part or quantity of a Muske-cat is of great vertue and efficacy; where∣fore it is very sparingly vsed in medicines or potions, neither is there any part thereof beaten or bruised as it is of all other beasts, but it is melted and dissolued in water which proceedeth from the sweetest Roses. It is also a beast which is very hot and dry, but ra∣ther mord dry then hot, yet notwithstanding the same his heate is asswaged and allayed by no other thing but onely the Gum called Camphire, and his drinesse is onely moyst∣ned or mollified with Oyles and very sweet, as oile of violets, and oile of Roses. Amongst sweete smels and sauours the principallest and chiefest laude and commendation is attri∣buted vnto the smell which proceedeth from the muske cat: For he doth not onely with his odoriferous and delightfull sauour please and content the scent of men, but also doth strengthen the spirits, and all the partes of mans body, yea and that in a moment, for the slendernesse of his partes, which although it doth forthwith penetrate or enter into the scent of man, yet doth it endure longer, and is not so speedily or quicklie dissolued as the scent or sauour of any other sweete smell whatsoeuer. A musk-cat and the hearb called Mercuries-fingers or Dogges-bane, being giuen in purging medicines to drinke, do greatly renew and refresh the decayed strength or force of those which haue beene before times weakened with diuers and continual medicines in their m bers. The same is also very profitable for those which are effeminate or defectiue, and ecclipsed in their mind or courage, as also for those which are weak and feeble in their ioynts, not by any hurt, or any other casuallity being enfeebled, Symeon but being alwaies so euen from their childhood. A musk-cat is an excellēt remedy for those which are troubled with feare in their hart, and also for those which do quiuer or shake either for fear or any other thing throughout all the parts of their body. The same is a very profitable and medici∣nable cure for those which are grieued with any ach or paine in their head or with any en∣ormity or trouble in their liuer, and is also being giuen simply by it selfe, Isidorus without any thing mixed in it or compounded in wine, is very good and wholsome for the healing and curing of those who haue any paine or griefe in their stomacke, which commeth by the occasion of any cold. A muske-catte being put vnto the body of any man in the forme or manner of a plaister, doth confirme and make strong both his hart▪ and all the rest of his bowels, Dioscorides or in∣terior parts: it doth moreouer encrease both strength and power in all his members, yea and in the very bones, the efficacy thereof is of such power and vertue. The same being layed or annointed vpon the head, is very effectual for the expelling or driuing away of the rheume which falleth from the head into the nostrils, and by that means procureth heaui∣nesse in the same, and for the amending and curing of the swimming dizzines or giddines in the head through the aboundant humors which remaine and stay therein, and also for the bridling and restraining of lust and venery. Auicenna The same being vsed in the aforesaid manner doth temperate and confirme the brains of any man, besides it easeth and helpeth those which haue paine about their heart, by the which they suppose their very heart to ake. The smell of this beast is both profitable and hurtfull, for vnto those which are cold of constitution, the scent is very pleasant in regard that is it hot of it selfe, and is very delightfull in their sauors: but vnto those which are hot of nature it is very noisome, in regard that the heat and strong scent therof ouercommeth their sences, and oftentimes causeth their heads to ake, and be full of paine, Rasis and doth al∣also stir vp in them that pestiferous disease called the falling sicknesse: but vnto women which are of a hot or fiery constitution it is more hurful & noisome, for it breedeth in them a very pestiferous disease which choketh their matrice or wombe, Brasauolus & causeth them often∣times to swound, it is called by some the mother. The sneezings of a muske-cat is an ex∣cellent remedy against the resolution of the sinnewes or the palsie. A muske-cat is very good & wholsome for the helping and curing of those which are troubled with any deafe∣nesse or astonishment in any part of their bodies, as also for the driuing away of melan∣cholicke and sorrowfull passions out of mens mindes, and for the incitating delightfull myrth and pleasure in them. A musk-cat being mixed and mingled with dry plaisters which are vsed for the healing of the eies, ia an excellent remedy for the expelling and driuing away of the white skinne which doth vsually couer the sight, and for the drying vp of moist rheumes and humors which in the night time do fall from the braines and the head, and by that meanes doth much hurt and damage the sight of the eies, as also for the clarifieng and healing vp of a∣ny paine or disease therein. A muske-cat is an excellent remedy for those which haue a desire to vomit and can∣not, it doth also renewe an appetite or stomacke in those vntill their victuals which doe loath and abstaine from all sustenance, and doth loosen and dissolue all thicke puffinges or windinesse in the interior parts or members of any one. A muske-catte being mingled with a causticke medicine, Platearius is very profitable and wholsome for the bringing forth of those Womens menses or fluxes which are stopped, and also for mouing conception in those women which are hindered in it by the occasion of some great cold. A medicine or suppositary being made of ambergryse, and mingled with a sweet gumme comming out of Syria and Styrax, and then mixed both together with a muske-cat and so bea en, vntill they come vnto a certaine salue, and layed vnto the secret parts of a wo∣man is very good for the aforesaide disease. A ice na There is a certaine iuyce or moistnesse in a musk cat which being pressed forth or dissolued, and mixed with the Oyle called Palma Christy, and annointed vpon the yard of any man, doth stir him vp to lust and venery.

And thus much shal suffice concer∣ning the cures and medicines of the musk-cat. OF THE MVLE. seuerall . T He Mule is a beast, called by the Hebrewes Pered, from whence comes the feminine Pirdah 3. of King. and there be some that say the reason of the Hebrew word is, from the seperation and sterility of this beast, for it is Pered, quia non pareat. The Chaldey word is Cudana, the Arabian Beal, but Gen. 36. for the Hebrew word Iemin, many trans∣late Mules. The Arabians Kegal, but the Graecian Sep∣tuagints Hemionous. The Graecians also call a Mule Astra∣he, from the strength of his body. The Latines cal a Mule Mulus, and Semiasinus, that is halfe an Asse, because on the one side he is a Horse, and on the other side an Asse, and therefore in his condicions he more resembleth an Asse then a Horse, whereupon lyeth this tale. A certaine Lydian Mule eeing his Image in the water, grew to be afraid of the greatnesse thereof, and ther∣vpon tooke his heeles and ran away as fast as he could; neither could he be stayed by al the wit of his keepers: Plutarch At length the mule remembring that he was the son of an Asse, he staied his course and came backe againe neighing. The Italians call a mule Mulo, and the female Mula, like the Latines, and the Spaniards. The French mulet, and the female Mule, from whence commeth the English word Mule. The Germans multhire, or mulesel. The Illiri∣ans meseck, and the Flemings mul. kinds o Mules. There is another kind of mules in Syria, diuers from those which are procreated by the copulation of a mare and an asse, & they receiue their names frō the similitude of their fa∣ces. For there is no other cause, why wilde Asses should be called Asses, but onely their similitude and tame Asses. And as among wilde Asses some of them are singularly swift, so also among these Syrian mules, there are some excellent speedy coursers. These mules procreate in their owne kinde, and admit no mixture, which Aristotle proued by nine of them which were brought into Phrygia, in the daies of Pharnacas, the father of Pharnaba∣zi. Theophrastrus also reporteth, that in Cappadocia, the mules engender among themselus, which Aristotle remembreth in his wonders, and hee might well haue spared it, for they are a kind of cat el among themselues. Aelianus. There be flocks of Asses and mares in India, where the mares do willingly admit the Asses in copulation, and bring forth red mules, the best of all other for running. The genera∣tion of Bur∣dens. But among the Indian Phyllians, their Asses, mules, Oxen, and Horses, are no big∣ger then Rams. As the mule is begotten betwixt an Asse and a mare, so the Burdon is be∣gotten betwixt a Horse, and a shee-Asse, wherefore the Italians call him Mulo Bastardo, that is, The p ts of mu s & their our. a bastard mule. For as the mule, more resembleth the Asse then the horse, so the Burdon more resembleth the horse then the Asse, the reason is, because all kinds followe the father. The mule hath some parts proper to the Asse, as long eares, a terrible voyce, a crosse vpon the shoulders, small feet, a leane body, and in al other things it resembleth a horse. The length of their eares serueth instead of their foretop, their colour is somewhat browne, but it varieth, for the Roman Cardinals haue mules of an ash-colour, and those very great ones with long tailes. They change their teeth and haue in number sixe and thirty, their Necke is like the Neck of an Asses, long, but not standing vpright, their bellies simple and of one quantity. They want a gall like all foure-footed-beastes, and there is a thing in their heart like a bone, as we haue shewed before in the story of the Asse. The foode of Asses. They eate such food as Horsses, and Asses do, but they grow fat by drinking, yet they drinke not like a Horse by thrusting in their Noses into the water, but onely touch it with their lips. Mizaldus Dioscorides They loue Cucumbers aboue all other meates, but the flowers and leaues of Rododa∣phne are poyson to Mules and Asses, The lenght of a Mules life. and to many foure-footed-beastes. Both a Mule and a horse grow from the first comming forth of their teeth, (by which their age is dis∣cerned) and after all their teeth are come forth, it is hard to know their age. The females in this kind are greater, more liuely, and liue longer then the males. It hath beene found that they haue liued to fourescore yeares of age. Such a one was presented at Athens, at what time Pericles builded the Temple of Minerua, where by reason of his age, he was dis∣missed from all labour, yet afterwardes he would not forsake his companions, but went with them, exhorting them with neighing to vndergoe the labour cheerefully; Where∣vpon there was a publike decree, that the saide Mule should haue an ordinary of pro∣uender appointed him in Prytanium, Aristotle Aelianus and that no body should driue him away from their Corne when he eate it, although it were in the Market place. The genera∣tiō of Mules. We haue shewed already that this Beast is engendered betwixt an Assea Mare, and therefore if a man would create vnto himselfe a notable breede of Mules, he must looke to the choyce both of his Male and Female. First of all for the female, that shee be of a great body, The election of a Mare to beare Mules. of sound bones, and of singular good shape, wherein he must not so much expect her velosity or aptnesse to runne, as her strength to endure labour, and especial∣ly to beare in her wombe a discordant Foale, begotten by an Asse, and to confer vpon it both the properties of his bodie, and the disposition. For when Mares do vnwillingly receiue the genitall seede of the Asse, the Fole doth not grow to perfection in the Mares belly, Pliny vntill she haue borne it thirteene monthes, whereby it resembleth more the slug∣gish and dul nature of his father, then the vigor of his mother. But for the helping of their copulation, they pull certaine haires out of the taile of the female, and afterwardes binde them together therewith. The choice of a mule. There is no lesser regarde to be had of the Stallion, lest the want of iudgment in the choyce of him do frustrate the experiment; Seeing therefore they are engendered be∣twixt a Mare and an Asse, or betwixt a Mare and a wilde-Asse, and the Mule, begotten betwixt the wilde Asse and the Mare doth excell all others, both for swiftnesse of course, hardnesse of foote, and generosity of stomack: yet is the tame Asse better for this breed then the wilde Asse, for he will be more beautifull in outward forme, and more tractable in disposition; And the Mules engendered by wilde-Asses, may be compared to these; yet can they neuer be so tamed but they retaine some qualities of their Wilde-Father; And therefore a Mule begotten betwixt them (I meane betwixt a wilde male Asse and a tame female Asse) are fitter for Nephewes then for sonnes; that is, their Foales may be∣get good Mules, and such as are tamable and tractable, because descent breaketh the corruption of nature, but themselues do neuer proue profitable. And therefore it is most commodious and necessary to gett such a Stalion Asse to the procreation of Mules, whose kinde by experiment is excellent, and outward partes euery way acceptable, such as these are; a long and great body, a stronge Necke, stronge and broade ribs, a wide breast full of muscles, loines full of sinnewes, stronge compacted, legges of colour blackish or spotted, for the mouse colour is too vulgar, and is not fit in a Mule. For it is but folly in a man to allow and approue, euery colour he looketh vpon, and therefore ( Collumella writeth) when there are spots vppon the tongue and pallet of a Ram, such also are found in the wooll of the Lambe he begetteth. And so also if an Asse haue diuers coloured haires vpon his eye browes, or vpon his eares, the foale he bringeth forth hath such colours in his skin; And hereunto agree both Paladius, and Absirtus saying; He that wil haue a good breed of Mules, must get an Asse of Elegant forme, a great stature, square members, a great head not like a horses, his face, cheekes, and lips not smal, his eies standing out of his head, and not little or hollow, broad Nosthrils, great eares, not hanging down, but standing vpright; a broad and long necke, a broade breast, rough with the pleights of his muscles, and strong to endure the kickings of the mare: great breastes, plates and other partes vnder his shoulders, and so downe to his legges, which ought to be strong, broad, and corpulent, and standing farre assunder, so as he may easily couer the mare. A great backe, and broad backe-bone, neither hollow nor standing vp with bunches, bearing a direct line vpon the middle. His shoulders not low but standing vp, the hipbone ful and longe, not bending too narrowely nor pinde buttockt, nor standing out sharpe, and they are best which haue the shortest tailes. Furthermore let his stones be great, his knees great and round, standing both alike, his legges bony and without flesh, nothing appearing in them but nerues and skin; not standing awry, nor yet of diuers colours, his pasterns not high, nor yet ouer-low: his feet not low nor bending inward, his hoofe thicke and hollow within, the inward part of it be∣ing cleare, according to the saying of Iuvenall : Nam{que} hic mundae, nitet vngula Mulae. His voice cleare and not hoarse, for so the mare wil be terrified from copulation. His co∣lour ought to be likewise cleare, as all black, hauing no white belie, or somewhat looking towards purple, and hauing one blacke spot vppon his mouth, or rather a blacke tongue and such as haue bin brought vp with horses. It is the fashion of some to take wilde Asses to tame them, to make Stalions for genera∣tion, for they beget the best Mules, if they be liberally fed and not enclosed, and neuer waxe wilde againe if they bee put among tame Asses. And the young one so gotten by him, will be like the syer: and if any haue a desire to make the Mules of strange colours, Absirtus they must couer the female with a cloth of that colour wherewithal they desire the young one to be foaled, as we haue shewed already in the discourse of Horsses, whereby there are raysed many excellent kinds and rases; or else they bring in their presence at the time of their copulation some great male Horsse or Asse, by the fight whereof they are made more fruitfull: or againe, some base and dispisable beast being offered to their view, doth make them to conceiue more noble Mules. If the wilde Asses be at any time heauy, and not willing to couer the Mare, then let there be another female Asse brought into the presence, by the sight whereof his lust so burneth that he rageth almost to madnesse for copulation: And therefore being denyed, the Asse doth more willingly leape vpon the Mare, whom before he loathed. Againe, it must be regarded, that the Stalion bee tyed and bound fast, so that he may not couer the Mare after she is with foal, nor yet haue accesse vnto her, least by kicking and biting he cause abortment, for many times they breake their bonds asunder, and greatly trouble the females with young, therefore they are accustomed to some labour, which taketh downe the heate of their lust: yet at the time that they are to couer the Mares, you must vse all diligence to awaken the drousie nature of the beast, so that with greater spirit the seede of the male and female may meete together. The Asses of Lybia wil not couer mares that haue manes vntil they be shorne off, for it seemeth they disdaine that their females shoulde haue more ornamentes then them∣selues, which are theyr husbands. We haue shewed already in the discourse of the Asse, that mares doe not willingly ad∣mit any Stalion Asse to couer them, except it be such a one as did sucke a Mare, which we called a horse-suckling or Equimulgus. For this cause men that propound vnto them∣selues to nourish rases of Mules, take the colt of an Asse so soon as it is foald and put to it a mare giuing milke in some darke place, wherein the mare not doubting any fraud, is de∣ceiued, and willingly yealdeth her vdders to the Asses foale; whereunto being accusto∣med for ten daies together, at last she taketh it for her own, and such a Stalion Asse loueth mares exceedingly: and on the other side, the Mare refuseth not him. And some say, that although they sucke their mothers milke, yet if from the time of their weaning they bee brought vp among Horsse-Colts, it is as good as if they had sucked mares. If the Asse be small which is a Stalion, he will quickly waxe olde, and his yssue be the worse, therefore they must prouide the largest and strongest Asses, and nourish them with the best hay and barly, that so his strength may abound before his copulation. He ought not to be vnder three yeares olde, nor yet brought vnto a Mare which neuer knew male, for such a one will beate him away with her heeles and mouth, and bring him into perpetuall hatred with that kind; wherefore they vse to bring some vile and vulgar Asse into the presence of the Mare, as it were to woo her, and prouoke her to copulation, that so if she beate him away it may be no hinderance to the Stallion, but if she seem to admit him, and desirous of copulation, then they take him away, and bring the appointed Stali∣on into his roome, and so the Mule is engendered. For the effecting of their copulation, there must be a place appointed for the purpose, betwixt two wals, hauing a narrow passage, that so the Mare may not haue liberty to fight with the Asse, and the Mares head must be tyed downe to a Manger or racke, the ground being so fashioned, that her forefeet may stand much lower then her hinder, and so ascend backward, to the intent that the asse may more easily leape vpon her back, and she receiue the seed more deepely. When the Mare hath brought forth the Mule, she giueth it suck halfe a yeare, and then driueth it away, which ought to be brought vp in some Mountains or hard places, that so the hoofes may grow hard and indurable. Having thus discoursed of the generation of Mules, it now followeth that we should enquire whether Mules thus engendered betwixt an Asse and a Mare, doth likewise bring forth in their owne kind. Obseruatumest (saith Pliny ) è duobus diuersis generibus tertij generis fieri, & neutri parentum esse similia, ea{que} ipsa qu ita nata sunt, non gignere, in omni animali∣um genere, id circo mulas no parere. That is to say; It hath beene obserued, that out of two diuers kinds, a third hath beene engendered, and yet like to neither of the parents, and those so engendered did not procreate others in the vniuersall kind of beastes, or among al creatures; And therfore Mules conceiued betwixt Asses and Mares, do not bring forth young. Whereupon Camerarius made this pretty riddle of a mule. Dissimilis patri, matri diuersa figura Confusi generis, generi non apta propago, Ex alijs nascor, nec quisquam nascitur ex me. Democritus is of opinion also, that Mules cannot conceiue, and that their secret places are not like other beastes, and the issue of confused kinds can neuer engender, but especi∣ally in a Mule, because it is made of diuers seedes, (I meane diuers in quantity, and al∣most contrary) for the seede of the Asse is cold, and the seede of the Mare is hot. Aristotle disputing of this matter concerning those kinds that are procreated of diuers parents, writeth in this sort, those beasts ioyne in copulation, whose kinds although they are diuers, yet are not their natures very disagreeable. If the quantity and stature be alike, and the times of going with young be equall, yet they remaine barren that are so begot∣ten, of which cause Empedocles and Democritus yeald reason: Empedocles obscurely, and Democritus more plainly, but neither of thē both wel; for they alledge the same demonstra∣tion about all beasts out of their kind. Democritus saith, that the passages of the Mules are corrupted in their wombes, because their beginning doth not consist of one and the same kind; but this is no reason, for that it happeneth also to other beastes that do engender. Empedocles he yealds a reason out of Plutarch, about the ioyning together of the seedes, and therefore compareth it to a commixtion of tinne and Brasse together, but hee saith he doth not vnderstand their meaning, and therefore proceedeth to expresse his owne opinion in these words. Frist (saith he) euery one of the Males do beget one of their owne kinde, but the females cannot conceiue, and this is no great wonder, because that Horsses are not alwaies fitte for generation, nor Mares to bring forth Coltes beyng couered: and therfore when asses and mares doe couple together, their issve may be more barren because they receiue the greater hinderance in the diuersity of kinde; for besides the coldnesse of the Asses seed which may bee one great cause of his barrennesse, they haue another property, if they doe not breed and engender before the casting of theyr Coltes Colts-teeth, they remaine steril and barren al their life long: for so doth the generatiue power of the Asses body rest vpon a tickle and Nice-point, apt to rise, or easie to fal away to nothing. And in like sort, is a horse prone to barrennesse, for it wanteth nothing but cold sub∣stance to be mingled with his seede, which commeth then to passe when the seede of the Asse is mixed with it, for there wanteth but very little, but that the Asses seed waxeth bar∣ren in his owne kind, and therefore much more when it meeteth with that which is beside his nature and kind. This also hapneth to Mules, that their bodies grow exceeding great, especially be∣cause they haue no menstruous purgation, and therefore where there is an annual bree∣ding or procreation, by the helpe and refreshing of these flowers, they both conceiue and nourish; now these being wanting vnto mules, they are the more vnfitte to procrea∣tion. The excrements of their body in this kinde they purge with their vrine, which apea∣reth because the male-mules neuer smell to the secrets of the female, but to their vrine, and the residue which is not voided in the vrine, turneth to encrease the quantity and greatnesse of the body, whereby it commeth to passe, that if the female mule doe con∣ceiue with foale, yet is she not able to bring it forth to perfection, because those thinges are dispersed to the norishment of her owne body, which should be imployed about the nourishment of the foale: and for this cause, when the Egyptians describe a barren wo∣man, they picture a mule. Alexander Aphroditius writeth thus also of the sterility of mules. Orus. An Emblem. Mules (saith he) seeme to be barren because they consist of beasts diuers in kind, for the commixtion of seedes, which differ both in habite and nature, doe euermore worke something contrary to na∣ture, for the abolishing of generation; for as the mingling together of blacke and white colours do destroy both the blacke and white, and produce a swart and brown, and ney∣ther of both appeare in the browne; so is it in the generation of the mules, whereby the habituall and generatiue power of nature is vtterly destroyed in the created compounde, which before was eminent in both kindes, simple and seuerall. These things saith he. Alcmaeon as he is related by Plutarch, (saith) that the male mules are barren by reason of the thinnesse and coldnes of their seed, and the females because their wombes are shut vp, and the veines that should carry in the seede, and expell out the menstruous purgati∣on, are vtterly stopt. And Empedocles and Diocles say, that the wombe is low, narrowe, and the passages crooked that leade into it, and that therefore they cannot receiue seede, or conceiue with young▪ whereunto I do also wilingly yeeld, b cause it hath bin often found that women haue beene barren for the same cause. To conclude therefore, mules beare very sildome, and that in some particular Nations if it be natural, or else their coltes are prodigious, and accounted monsters. Concerning their natural birth, in hot regions where the exterior heat doeth temper the coldnesse of the Asses seed, there they may bring forth. And therefore Columella and Varro say, that in many parts of Affricke, the Colts of Mules are as familiar & common, as the Colts of mares are in any part of Europe. So then by this reason it is probable vnto me, Mules engen¦der. that mules may engender in all hotte Countries, as there was a mule did engender often at Rome; or else there is some other cause why they do engender in Affricke, and it may be that the Affrican mules are like to the Syrian mules before spoken of, that is, they are a special kinde by themselues and are called mules for resemblaunce, and not for nature. It hath beene seene that a mule hath brought forth twinnes, but it was held a prodigy. Herodotus in his fourth book recordeth these two stories of a mules procreation, when Darius (saith he) besieged Babilon, the Ba∣bilonians scorned his army, and getting vp to the top of their Towers, did pipe and dance in the presence of the Persians, and also vtter very violent and oprobrius speeehes against Darius and the whole army, amongest whom one of the Babilonians said thus: Quid istic desidetis ô Persae, quin potius absceditis, tunc ex pugnaturi nos cum peperint Mulae. O ye Persi∣ans why do you sit heer, wisdome would teach you to depart away, for when mules bring forth young ones, then may you ouercome the Babilonians. Thus spake the Babilonian, beleeuing that the Persians should neuer overcome them, because of the common pro∣uerbe, Epean emionoi tekosin, when a mule beareth young ones. But the poore man spake truer then he was aware of, for this followed after a yeare and seuen monthes: While the siedge yet lasted, A history of Mules. it hapned that certain mules belonging to Zopyrus, the sonne of Mega∣biz s brought forth young ones, whereat their maister was much mooued, while hee re∣membred the aforesaid song of the Babilonian, and that therefore he might be made the Author of that fact, communicated the matter with Darius, who presently entertayned the deuice, therefore Zopirus cut off his owne nose and eares, and so ranne away to the Babilonians, telling them that Darius had thus vsed him, because he perswaded him to de∣part with his whole armye from Babilon, (which hee saide) was inexpugnable and inuin∣cible. The Babilonians seeing his wounds, and trusting to their owne strength, did easilye giue credence vnto him, for such is the nature of men, that the best way to beguile them is, to tel them of those thinges they most desire, for so are their hopes perswaded before they receiue any assurances. But to proceed, Zopyrus insinuated himselfe further into the fauor of the Babilonians, and did many valiant actes against the Persians, whereby he got so much credit, that at last he was made the generall of the whole Army, and so betraied the Citty vnto the handes of Darius: thus was Babilon taken when Mules brought foor h. Another mule brought forth a young one, at what time Xerxes passed ouer Hellespont, to go against Graecia with his innumerable troopes of souldiors, and the said mule so broght forth, had the genitals both of the male and female. Vnto this I may adde another story out of Swetonius, in the life of Galba Caesar. As his father was procuring Augurismes or deuinations, an Eagle came and tooke the bowelles out of his hands, and caryed them into a fruit-bearing-oake; he enquiring what the mea∣ning of that should be, receiued answere, that his posterity should bee Emperours, but it would be very long first, whereunto he merily replied; Sanecum mula pepererit ; I sir, when a mule brings forth young ones: which thing afterwardes happened vnto Galba, for by the birth of a mule, he was confirmed in his enterprises when hee attempted the Empire, so that, that thing which was a prodigy and cause of sorrowe and a wonder to all other peo∣ple, was vnto him an ominous confirmation of ioye and gladnes, when hee remembered his grand-fathers sacrifice and saying. Therefore it was not ill saide of Democritus; Mula non naturae opus, sed humanae machinationis, adulterinum inventum, & furtum esse videntur. Mules are not the proper worke of nature, but an adulterous invention of humaine poli∣cy, robbing nature: for (saith he) when a certaine Median founde his Asse couering of his mare, The inuen∣tion of mules Aelianus. whereupon afterwards she fell to be with foal, and seeing the yong one to com∣unicate with both natures, they drew it into a custom to couer the Mares with their Asses for the engendring of such a breed. Some are of opinion that mules first began amonge the Paphlagonians, which before the Troyan warre were called Eneti, and afterwards Veneti : but in Gen. 36. wee finde that Anna the father in law of Esau, keeping his fathers Asses, did inuent Gemim, that is, mules. as some interpret. But rather I beleeve, that while Asses and Horses ranne wilde in the wildernesse among themselues, the wilde Asses first beganne this race. The male at seuen yeares old may engender, because he is of a hotter nature then the female, and also doth not in his generation conferre any part of his bodily groath to the yong one, and some∣times he engendereth when he hath lost his foremost teeth, and after the first copulation, he neuer engendreth more. Aristotle the quantity o a mules oa e. The young one so generated, is called Ginnus and Pumilio, for it is a very dwarfe, according to the obseruation of Martiall: His tibi de mulis non est metuenda ruina Altius in terris pene sedere soles. Such as these were kept in the Court of the Duke of Ferraria, and although in al thinges they resemble the mother, yet are named after the father, and such also are the Burdones before spoken of in the story of the horse. Mules are begotten both by Mares, she-Asses, and Bulles, but yet those are the best that are begotten betwixt an Asse and a mare. And thus much for the generation of mules. They are nourished with the same meate that Horses and Asses are, annoyed with the same sicknesses, and cured with the same means, generaly blood-letting is good for them, and for their dyet Bullimunge. In Scythia they can ablde no cold, and therefore the hor∣ses are there vsed instead of Mules. In some countries the Horses can abide no colde, but the Asses and Mules beare it out (as Herodotus writeth,) and as we haue shewed before in the story of the Asse: when the Graecians were at Troy, and were destroyed by a consu∣ming pestilence, the firste of all their company that dyed were their Dogges and their Mules, and the reason of it was, because the pestilence arising out of the earth, they by the sence of smelling, which is very quicke in both kinds, did first of all draw in that poysonne from the earth. Collumella saith, that the medicines for the Oxen doe also cure mules, Sicknesses of Mules and their cures. yet there are speciall medicines not to bee neglected, which we will expresse in this place. For a mule that hath a Feuer, giue her raw Cabbadge, and for one that is short winded vse blood let∣ting, and for a drinke giue it a pinte of wine and oyle mixed with halfe an ounce of Fran∣kinsence, and halfe a pint of the iuyce of Hore-hound. For the scratches or disease in the hooues, lay to it Barley meale, then make suppuration with a knife, and cure it by laying two linnen cloathes, or by a pinte of the best Garum, and a pound of oyle infused into the left Nosthrill of the Mule, whereunto you may adde, the whites of three or foure Egs se∣perated from the yolkes. The female Mule may be burned in the feet, or let blood after the manner of Horses, and some Countreymen giue in their food the hearb Veretrum, or else the seed of Hyo∣scanus or Henne-bane beaten to powder and drunke in wine. For the languishing of the chine or leannesse they make this drinke, haue an ounce of beaten brimstome, a raw Eg, a penny weight of the powder of Myrrh, mingled al three together in wine, and so pou∣red downe the Mules throate, is a present remedy to cure it. As also for the paine in the belly and all manner of coughes, the herb Medica is speciall good for the said languishing disease. So also to fat the mule if it be giuen greene and not dryed like hay a little at a time for feare the beast be suffocated with ouermuch blood. When a mule is tyred or heated, Collumella let the load be taken off, and turne her forth to wallowe in some conuenient place. If that suffice not, take some fat, and put it into her chappes, that so she may sucke it downe, Rutius. and poure wine after it. For to keepe the neckes of mules from wringing and loosening their skinne, vse this medicine, take two pound of Hogges-greace sod three times, Pelagonius or vnto the third part two pintes of Vineger, and therewithall annoint the mules necke. As we haue shewed that the paines of a horses belly and guts are best of al cured by the sight of a Mallard, swimming in the water, whereby they are speedily deliuerd from all manner of torment, so the same hath as great or greater operation to cure the paines of the mules belly. It is reported by Auicen that mules fall into madnesse, and in that madnes bite their maister mortally. They are likewise subiect to the gout, and especially to swellings about the crowne of their pa∣sternes, but they are cured as horses and Oxen. They liue longe, ordinarily to fifty yeares, and sometimes to fourscore, the reason therof is giuen by Coelius: Animalia quae frequenter coeunt preuioris sunt vitae, inde fit, vt muli equos superint, videndi diuturmitate ; that is to say, Those beasts and creatures which often times ioyne in copulation haue but short liues, and from thence it commeth, that mules liue longer then horses. The Epithets of a Mule are these; packe-bearer, durty, Spanish, rough, The epithits & conditions of Mules. and by-for∣med. There is an Adage or prouerbe called Mulus Marianus, and by it is signified a man which is apt both for to obey and to rule; it was taken from Marius the great Romaine Souldiour and commaunder, whose fashion was, when he had commaunded any of his Souldiors to fetch a burden, or do any vilde seruice, he himselfe would put his hande vn∣to it. It signifieth properly a bearing backe, or colt-staffe, as we say in English, whereup∣pon poore men carry their burdens, and from thence it was translated into a prouerbe to signifie all that do obey commaunds. There be some which giue another reason of this prouerbe, for they say, that when Scipio did besiege Numantia, he did not onely determin to looke into the weapons of his Souldiours, but also to his horses, mules, and chariots. Then Marius brought forth an horse, nourished by himselfe very delicately: Besides the the horse a mule of a very comely body, farre excelling all other mules both in gentle∣nesse and in strength. Therefore seeing the Emperor was delighted with the beasts of Ma∣rius, and would now and then make mention of the mule, at length it came to a common iest, to call a double diligent seruant Mulus Marianus. The Italians doe commonly call those men mules which are base borne, and not by lawfull marriage. Concerning the disposition of mules, it is well obserued by Aristotle, that mules are alwaies tame, Alunnus The inward disposition of Mules. and if at any time they be more wilde, they abate their vntamable nature by drinking of wine, because by the operation of the wine, their heeles and hard parts do resolue and grow soft; by the same reason that Apes by drinking of wine loose their nails, and men accustomed to drunkennesse fal into palsies: for there is such a dispersing and discussing nature in wine, that it dissolueth all nerues and harde thinges in the bodies of beasts, euen as water dissolueth hard fruits and pease, & Vineger maketh lead as soft as an Egge, that it may be drawne thorough a Ring: and such is the nature of mules, that after they haue drunke wine, they feele themselues disarmed, and therefore giue ouer to resist because by kicking backewardes, they receiue more harme then they giue, and thus the guiltines of their owne weakenes, maketh them gentle against their willes, for otherwise they hate mankind, Pliny. and are nothing so tractable as horses. For Varro saith, that they haue so much confidence in their heeles, that by them alone, they kil wolues when they come among them. Vse of Mules in their seue∣ral workes Cardan Mules were wont to be vsed for plowing, and for carying both of men and burthens, but now in most parts of Europe, Iudges and great Princes ride vppon them vntill they be olde, and then they sell them to the poore men, who turne them into the mountaines where they suffer them to runne wilde til their hoofes be hardned for long trauailes, and then they take them vppe againe. They haue beene also accustomed to ploughing, accor∣ding to these verses; Quantum mularum sulcus praecedit in aruo Tantumis praecurrit. For the mules did plough more speedily, and come to the landes end more quickly then either the Oxe or Horse. And Martiall saith, that they were vsed in carts to draw timber according to these verses: Vix{que} datur long as, mulorum vincere mandras Quae{que} trahi multo, marmora fune vides. They were also vsed in race at the games of Olympus, as we haue already shewed in the story of the horse, but that custome dyed quickely, because that the Arcadians coulde not endure mules. The price of mules was great, for Crispine (saith Iuvenal ) gaue sixe thousand peeces of mony for a mule, and yet he saith it was not wel worth six pounde, the verses of Iuvenal are these: Crispinus mulum, sex millibus emit aequantem Sane paribus sestertia libris Vt perhibent qui de magnis maiora loguutur. The Cappaedocians payed to the Persians euery yeare besides Siluer and Gold, fifteen hun∣dred horses, two thousand mules, and fifty thousand sheepe; but the Medians payed twice so much. The dwarfish mules called Ginni were also much set by, not for vse, but onely for delight, as dwarfs are kept in Noble mens houses. When Pysistratus the sonne of Hip∣pocrates first of al affected Tyrany at Athens, and labored to get the gouernment to him∣selfe, as he came out of his countrey being drawne with a chariot by mules, he wounded himselfe and his mules very greeuously, and so draue them into the market place, shew∣ing his wounded body and beasts vnto the Athenians, telling them that so he was woun∣ded by his enemies, and that hee escaped death verie narrowely, but if it pleased them to graunt him a gard of souldiors to defend his body, he would take reuenge vpon their and his enemies: whereunto they yeelded, and hee hauing gotten a bande of souldiors vnder that pretence, presently tooke vpon him the gouernment and soueraigntie. To conclude this story of mules, I do read in Aelianus, that Serpents do loue to feed on the flesh of deade mules, and two things are very eminent in the nature of mules, one of their vnderstanding, and the other of their friendship. Concerning the first, Plutarch relateth this story of a mule that was accustomed to carry salt, who vppon a season going through a water, fell downe vnderneath his burden, so that the salt tooke wet, afterwards the beast perceiued how by that meanes, his extreame loade melted away, and so became lighter & lighter; afterward the Mule grew to this custome, that whensoeuer he came loa∣ded with salt ouer that water, he fell downe in it for the easing of his cariage, his Master perceauing his craft, on a day he loaded him with Woole, and spunges, and so the beast comming ouer the water fell downe as he was wont to doe with his salt, and comming out of the water, he felt his load to grow heauier then it was wont to doe, in steed of lessening, whereat the beast much mused, and therefore neuer afterward durst lye downe in the wa∣ter, for feare of the like increase of his load. The other obseruation of their loue and friendship, ariseth from the Prouerbe Mutuum muli scabunt, that is, Mules scratch one another, and helpe one another in their extremitie; from whence commeth our prouerb, one good turne asketh an other, and the Latine prouerbe, Senes mutuum fr at, olde men rub one another; which did arise vpon this occasion, as Adrian the Emperor so passed a long on a day by a bath, he saw an olde souldier in the bath rubbing himselfe vpon a mar∣ble stone for want of a man to helpe him, whereupon in pittie of his case he gaue him maintenance for himselfe and a man: afterwards other old souldiers seeing how well their fellow had sped, went likewise into the bath before the Emperors eyes, and rubbed them∣selues vpon the Marble, thinking to get as much fauour and libertie as their fellow had gotten, but the Emperor seeing them, and perceauing their fetches, bid them rub one another, and thereupon came that prouerbe. And thus much for the naturall discourse of Mules, now followeth the medicinall. The medicines of the Mule. The dust wherein a Mule shall turne or rowle himselfe, Pliny. being gathered vp and spread or sprickled vpon the body of any one who is ardently and feruently in loue will present∣ly asswage, and quench his inflaming desire. A man or woman being poysoned and put into the belly of a Mule or Cammell which is new killed, will presently expell away the force of the venome or poyson, and will confirme and make stronge their decayed spi∣rits, and all the rest of their members: Ponzettus For as much as the very heate of those beastes is an Antidote or preseruatiue against poyson. The skinne or hide of a Mule being put vnto places in any ones body which are burned with fire, doth presently heale and cure the same: it doth also heale sores and grieuous vlcers which are not come vnto impostumes. The same is an excellent remedie for those whose feete are worne or wrung together through the pinching of their shoes, to helpe themselues withall, Auicenna and for those which are lame, and those which are troubled with those grieuous sores called Fistulaes. If any man shall take either in meate or drinke the marrow of a Mule, to the weight or quan∣titie of three golden crownes, he shall presently become blockish and altogether vnex∣pert of wisedome and vnderstanding, and shall be voide of all good nutriment, Albertus Aesculapius and maners. The eare laps or eare lages of a Mule, and the stones of a mulet being borne and caried by any woman, are of such great force and efficacie, that they will make her not to conceaue. The hart of a Mule being dryed and mingled with wine, and so giuen to a woman to drinke after that she is purged or clensed thirtie times, hath the same force, Sextus and power that the aforesaid medicine hath for the making of a woman barren. The same effect against conception hath the barke of a white popular tree, being beaten together with the reines of a Mule, then mingled in wine and afterwards drunke vp. If the hearbe called Harts tongue, be tyed vpon any part of a woman, with the spleene of a mule, Auicenna but as some haue affirmed by it selfe onely, and that in the day which hath a darke night, or with∣out any Moone shine at all, it will make her altogether barren and notable to conceaue. If the two stones of a mule be bound in a piece of the skinne of the same beast and hanged vpon any woman, Albertus they wil make that she shal not conceaue so long as they shal be bound vnto her. The left stone of a weasell being bound in the skin or hide of a mule, and steeped or soked for a certaine space or time in wine, or in any other drinke, & the drinke in which they are so steeped giuen to a woman to drinke, doth surely make that she shall not con∣ceaue. The stones of a mulet being burned vpon a barren and vnfruitfull tree, Aesculapius and put out or quenched with the stale or vrine of either man or beast which is gelded, being bound and tyed in the skin of a Mule, & hanged vpon the arme of any woman after her menstrual fluxes, will altogether resist and hinder her conception. The right stone of a Mule being burned and fastened vnto the arme of a woman which is in great paine and trauaile, Sextus. will make that she shall neuer be deliuered vntill the same be losened and taken away: but if it shall happen that a maide or young virgin shall take this in drinke after her first purgation or menses, shee shall neuer be able to conceiue, but shall bee alwaies barren and vnfruite∣full. The matrix or wombe of a female Mule taken and boiled with the flesh of an Asse or a∣ny other flesh whatsoeuer, and so eaten by a woman which doth not know what it is, will cause her neuer to conceiue after the same. The worme which is called a gloworme, or a Globird, being taken out of the wombe or matrice of a female Mule and bound vnto any part of a womans body, Kirami s wil make that she shal neuer be able to conceiue. The dust or powder which proceedeth from the hoofes of a male or female Mule being mixed or mingled with oil which commeth from Mirtleberies, Plinie doth very much help those which are troubled with the gout in their legs or feet. The dust of the hoofes of a Mule be∣ing scorched or burned, and the Oyle of Mirtle berries being mingled with Vineger, and moist or liquid Pitch, Marcellus and wrought or tempered in the forme or fashion of a plaister, and opposed or put vnto the head of any one whose haires are too fluent and abundant, doth very speedily and effectually expell the same. The Liuer of a Mule being burned or dryed vnto dust, and mixed with the same oile of Mirtle berries, and so annointed or spread vpon the head, is an excellent and profitable remedy for the curing of the aforsaid enormity. The dust or powder of the hoofes of a female Mule is very wholesome and medicinable for the healing and curing of all griefes and paines which do happen or come vnto a mans yard, Sextus being sprinkled thereupon. The hoofe of a Mule being borne by a woman which is with child, doth hinder her conception. The filth or vncleanesse which is in the eares of a Mule, being bound in the skin or hide of a little or young Hart, and bound or hanged vp∣on the arme of a woman after her purgation, doth cause that she may not conceiue. The same being in like manner mingled or mixed with oile which is made of Beauers stones, doth make any woman to whom it is giuen to drink, altogether barren. The durt or dung Mule being mixed with a sirup made of hony, Marcellus. vineger, and water, and giuen to any one to drinke that is troubled with the heart swelling, and it will very speedily and effectually cure the paine thereof. The dung of a Mule being burned or dryed and beaten small, and afterwardes sifted, or seirced and washed or steeped in wine, and giuen to any woman to drink, whose men∣struall fluxes come forth before their time, will in very short space cause the same to stay. The stale or vrine of a male or female Mule being mingled with their durt or dung, ippocrates. is very good and medicinable for those to vse which are troubled with cornes and hard bunches of flesh which grow in their feete. Assafoetida being mingled with the vrine of a Mule to the quantity of a beane and drunke, will altogether be an impediment and hinderance to the conception of any woman. R s . The stale or vrine of a mule being taken to the quantity of eight pounds, with two pounds of the scumme or refuge of siluer, and a pound of old and most cleare oile, al these being beaten or pounded together vntil they come to the thick∣nesse of the fat or sweat which falleth from mens bodies, and boiled vntill they come vn∣to so liquid and thinne a iuyce, Aegi eta that they will speedily and effectually cure and helpe those which are troubled with the gout or swelling in the ioynts. If a woman shall take the sweat which proceedeth from a horse, and annoint it vpon a wollen cloath and so apply it as a plaister or suppositary vnto her secret parts, it will make her altogether barron. Ra . There is an excellent remedy for those which are pursie or short∣winded which commeth also by the mule: which is this, to take or gather the froath or fome of a mule, and to put it into a cup or goblet, and giue it in warme water for a certain space or time to be drunke, either to the man or woman which is troubled with this enor∣mity, Marcel s and the party which doth so vse it, shall in short space haue remedy, but the mule will without any lingring of time, or consuming of time in paine and sorrow dye. The milt of a male or female Mule being drunke in a potion or iuice made of hony water and vinegar, to the value or quantitie of three cruces or cups full, Pliny is commended for an excellent cure and medicine for those which are troubled and grieued with that pestiferous and deadly disease called the falling sicknesse, otherwise Saint Iohns euill. There is an excellent remedie for those which are troubled in the voyding of their wa∣ter, which is this, to take the ring-wormes or Tetters which doe grow vppon both the legges of a Mule aboue their knees, and which doe sticke thereupon in the manner of a dryed thicke skinne, and to burne or parch them, Marcellus and afterwards to put or place them vpon him which is troubled with the strangurie, or can not voide his water but by drops∣meale, so that there be great care had to couer close with clouen or clefted cloathes, or garments, the suffumigation thereof, least that the smell or fume doe fade, and voide away, and this being so vsed will be very effectuall for the curing and driuing away of the aforsaid disease. The haires of a Mule and an Asse being mingled together & dryed, Trallianus and put into some certaine perfume, and so giuen to any one to drinke which is troubled with the falling sicknesse, will presently expell and driue it quite away. In the place or part of mans body wherein a male or female mule shall bite, Ponzettus affirmeth, there will presently arise, and grow small pushes, or little blisters which are alwaies full of red and pale humors, and filthie corruption, which can almost be healed and cured by no salue, potion, or medi∣cine, by any meanes applyed thereunto. There are some also which doe suppose the bi∣ting of mules to be poyson, for truely there doth not onely follow those aforesaid pushes and biles, but also an extreame and almost indurable inflammation and burning, through all the parts of the body, which doth greatly distemperate and vex the same. But it is affirmed by others that the biting of mules is to be cured after the same ma∣ner as the biting of a Cat, which is thus: First, to wash and clarifie the wound or bitings where the corruption is with vinegar mingled with oyle of roses, and then to take peny∣roiall, or the hearbe called Neppe and boile it, and stroke or rub the wound very softly with it, and it will in time wholy cure it. And thus much shall suffice at this time concer∣ning the cures and medicines of mules. Of the Neades, Neides, or Naides. H Eraclides, Coelius, Volateranus, and Euphorion, do all write that once the Isle of Samos was a desert place, and that there were in it cer∣taine beastes called Neades, whose voice was so terrible that they shooke the earth therewith, and from those strange and great voy∣ces came the vulgar Greeke prouerbe, Meizoon mia toon Neaedoon maius vna Neadum. That is, One of the Neades was a greate wonder, for it was vsed in ostentation to shew that there was nothing in the whole World comparable to their vast and huge quantity. Of the parts of these beasts there is no memory but only in Suidas and Aelianus, who affirme that their bones were to be seene in their daies. And this title I thought good to insert into this history, leauing the Reader to consider whither he wil take them for Elephants or for any other greater beast; for my opinion if it be desired, I thinke them rather (if there euer were any such) that they were Elephants of greater stature then euer since were seene, and not any generation of beasts now lost and vtterly perished. Of the Ounce, the description whereof was taken by Doctor Cay in England. T Here is in Italy a beast called Alphec, which many in Italy, France, The name of this beast. and Germany cal Leunza, and some Vnzia, from whence Albertus and Isidorus make the Latin word Vnctia, and I take it to be the same beast which is called Lozanum, and for the description of it, I can follow no better author then Doctor Cay, The descrip∣tion of Doct. Cay. who describeth it in this fashion. The Ounce (saith he) is a most cruel beast, of the quanti∣ty of a village or mastiffe Dog, hauing his face and ears like to a lyons, his body, taile, feet, and nails like a Cat, of a very terrible aspect, his teeth so strong and sharpe, that he can euen cut wood in sunder with them: he hath also in his nailes so great strength, that he onely fighteth with them, and vseth them for his greatest defence: The colour of the vpper partes of his body being like whitish Oake, the lower being of the colour of ashes, being euery where mixed with a blacke and frequent spot, but the taile more blacke then the rest of his body, and as it were obscured with a greater spot then the residue. His eares within are pale without any blacknesse, without black, without any palenesse, if you do but take away one dark & yellow spot in the midst thereof, which is made of a double skin ri∣sing, meeting in the top of the eare, that is to say, that which ariseth from the outward part of the iaw on the one side, and commeth from the vper part of the head on the other side, and the same may be easily seene and seperated in the head being dried. The rest of the head is spotted all ouer with a most frequent and black spot (as the rest of the body) except in that part which is betwixt the nose and the eyes, wherein there are none, vnlesse onely two, and they very small: euen as all the rest are lesser then the rest in the extreame and lowest parts: the spots which are in the vpper parts of the thighes, and in the taile, are blacker and more singular, but framed in the sides with such an order, as if all the spots should seeme to be made of foure. There is no order in the spots, except in the vpper lip, where there are fiue rowes or orders. In the first and vppermost two which are seuered; In the second, sixe, being ioyned in in that manner, as if they should seeme to be in one line: These two orders are free, and not mingled amongst themselues. In the third order there are eight ioyned together, but with the fourth where it endeth they are mixed together. The fourth and fifth in their be∣ginning (which they haue to the nose) being separated with a very little difference, doe foorth-with ioyne themselues, and runne together through all the vpper lip, and doe not make a spot through all the same, but a broad line. In the beast being dead the spots do so stand, (as I suppose) for the contraction of the skinne. In the beast being aliue, those spots doe seeme separated euery one in their owne orders. In the very middle the lower lip although they do keepe the quantity, do not obserue the order. The nose is blackish, a line being softly led through the length, and onely through the top of the out∣side thereof. The eies are gray, the former teeth are onely sixe, not very vnlike to mens teeth, except those which are placed in the middle are lesser, and they in the vttermost part are greater, as also higher then those which are low. In this beast the teeth are both great, sharp, and long, being ioyned to the rest in the lower iaw, and in the vpper seuered with so great space, that the lower teeth may be recei∣ued therein. These when the beast liueth are couered with his lips, but when hee is dead they are otherwise, his lips being through drinesse shrunk together. His foreteeth are ve∣ry big, and as long as two Roman fingers, for at the very root therof it cannot be compre∣hended in lesse then two Roman fingers and a halfe compasse. In his tooth there is a certain small hollownesse through all the length thereof, which notwithstanding doth not appeare except the tooth be broken. The lower iaw is very hard and stiffe, hauing 3. teeth vnequal in quantity, as the vpper 4. Betweene the great tooth and the first cheeke tooth of the vn∣der iaw, there is a void space to the quantity of one finger, from which the first is present∣ly placed, lesser then the other two: to this there is another greater close adioyning: and after this there is also a third greater then the second. In the vpper iaw, in that middle space (which I said was of one Roman finger) betweene the great tooth and the first cheek tooth, there is a very little tooth and without any forme, comming so smally out of the iaw, that there is no lower tooth which may answer to the same. After that, in the space of halfe a finger there is a second, to which there is ioynd a third, and after this a fourth, be∣tweene themselues, the vpper and the lower cheeke-teeth, and so are ioyned together as they agree in the manner of a combe, the two first teeth in the lower iaw, and the 2. and 3. in the vpper iaw are of the same figure, as the compasse of the tops of the crownes of the king of England & France. The 3. is of the same figure in the lower iaw, and the fourth of the vpper iaw, except that the interior side of both the gums which is nearer to the throat, by nature is taken away. There was no other teeth ioyned to these in both the iawes. But I do not know whether there be any more teeth in the gum beyond the reach of ones fin∣ger, in the farthest row or behind the teeth. But this I know that to all appearance there was none remaining, and it may be that his lips were cut or slit downe beyond nature to shew his teeth. It liueth of flesh, and the female is more eruell then the male, The meate and nature. though les∣ser, and one of either sex was broght out of Mauritania into England in a ship, for they are bred in Libia. If they haue any appointed time of copulation, it is neare the month of Iune, for in that month the male couereth the female. We haue shewed already that Li∣ons may be tamed, and that also hath bin manifest in London, both in the tower and in the citty, for there the Lions did play with their keepers and kisse them without harme, (as Docter Cay saith he saw them do) but these beasts were so fierce and wild as they could ne∣uer be tamed, for when soeuer their keeper shoulde change or remoue them from place to place, he was constrained first of al to strike them so hard with a club vpon the head that they should lie halfe dead, & so put them in a sack or wodden chest made of purpose with holes in it for respiration and expiration, to carry them too and fro from one lodging to another: after an houre they reuiued againe like a Cat, but when they were to be taken out of the hutch or chest, he was constrained likewise to astonish them again with his club; but afterwardes they grew to inuent an engine to put the beast in, and take him out of the hutch with a rope or cord, and so do remoue them from place to place. The keepers affir∣med that they did seeme much to disdaine the Lions, and oftentimes endeuored to fight with them, but they were kept asunder with grates: they would not hurt a little Dog when he was put to them but when they were hungry, but if a great dog wer put vnto them, they tore him in pieces although their bellies were neuer so ful. When they are angry they vter a voice like an angry dog, but they double the ( Arr ) twice, and also bigger then any dogs, proceeding out of a large breast and wide arteries, much like to the howling of a great mastiue, that is shut vp in a close roome alone against his will. Some say it is longer then a dog, but it did not so appeare in England, for we had many mastiue dogs as long as it, but yet was it euery way greater then any other kind of dogs. It is but a vaine report, that some haue said when a man or beast is bitten with an Ounce, presently mice flock vnto him and poison him with their vrine. For it was seene in England that two of the keepers were wounded and shreudly bitten by one of the Ounces, and there followed them no other harme then that which follow∣weth the biting of an ordinary Dogge, or like a small incision with a knife. Hee neuer fighteth but at the head, and that trecherously if he perceiue his aduersary to be to strong or to great for him, and that by counterfetting quietnesse, beneuolence and peace, as if hee ment no harme: for so he serued a great Mastiue Dogge in England, at the first sight he seemed to applaud his comming, looking cheerefully vppon him, and wagging his taile, presently he fell downe on his belly as it were to inuite the Dogge to com neare him by his submission, lastly he got close vnto him, creeping as though hee would play with him, putting out one of his feete as Cats do when they play, wherewithall the great Dogge grew secure, and began nothing to mistrust the Beast, at length when the Ounce saw his opportunity, he suddenly leaped vpon his Necke, and tooke him by the throate, and pulled it out, after he had killed him, with his Nailes he opened the Dogges breast, and taking out his heart, did eate it before all the people in most cruell manner, thus far Docter Cay speaketh of the Ounce, and beside him no other Author that I know. The gall of this beast is deadly poyson, it hateth all creatures, and destroyeth them, especially men, and therefore it may wel be said to be possessed with some euill spirit. It loueth none but his owne kind. And thus much for the Ounce. OF THE ORYX. T His Beast in Pliny and Oppianus is called Orynx and Oryx, and my coniecture is, that his name is deriued from Orys¦sein which signifieth to digge. Saint Ierom and the Septua∣gints for Theo. Deut. 14. & Isa. 51. translate Orix: but Da∣uid Kimhi and the better learned men interpret it a wilde Oxe But the Haebrew Dischon may in my opinion bee so translated, yet heerein I referre it to the learned Rea∣der. It is certaine that it is of the kinde of wilde Goates by the description of it, differing in nothinge but this, that the haire groweth auerie not like other beasts, falling backeward to his hinder partes, but forward toward his head, and so also it is affirmed of the Aethiopian Bul, which some saye is the Rhinocerot. They are bred both in Lybia and Egypt, and either of both countries yedeth testimony of their rare and proper qualities. In quantity it resembleth a Roe, ha∣uing a beard vnder his chinne. His colour white or pale like milke, his mouth blacke, and some spots vpon his cheekes, his backe-bone reaching to his head, being double, broad, and fat; his horne, standing vpright, blacke, and so sharpe, that they cannot bee blunted against brasse or yron, but pierce through it readily. Aristotle and Pliny were of opinion that this beast was Bisulcus and Vnicornis, that is, clouen-footed, and with one horne: The original of their opinion, came from the wilde-one-horned-goat, whereof Schnebergerus a late writer writeth thus: Certum est minineque dubium in Carpatho monte, versus Russiam Transyluaniam{que} reperirifer as similes omnino ru∣picapris, exc pto quod vnicum cornu ex media fronte enascitur, nigrum, dorso inflexum, simile omnino rupicaprarum cornibus: that is to say, It is without al controuersie that there are wilde beasts in the mountaine Carpathus towards Russia and Transyluania, very like to wilde goates, except that they haue but one horne growing out of the middle of their heads, which is blacke and bending backward like the hornes of wild goats. But the true Oryx is described before out of Oppianus, and it differeth from that of Pliny both in stature and hornes. Aelianus saith, that the Orix hath foure hornes, but he speaketh of the Indian O∣rix whereof there are some yearely presented to their king, and it may be both there and else-where, diuersity of regions do breede diuersity of stature, colour, haire, and hornes. Simion Cethi affirmeth of the Muskat that it hath one horne, and it is not vnlikely that he hath seene such an one, and that the Orix may be of that kind. But concerning their hornes, it is related by Herodotus, Pollux, and Laur: Valla, that there were made instruments of musicke out of them, such as are Citherns or Lutes, vp∣pon whose bellies the Musitians played their musicke, by striking them with their hands, and that those beasts were as great as Oxen, and al this may be true, notwithstanding wee haue shewed alreadie that they are as big as Roes, for Plinie speaking that by relation or by sight, it is likelie that he had seene a young one. There be also Sea-beasts called Oryges and Orcae, and there is in Egipt an ORIX which at the rising of Canis Syrius or the little Dogge is perpetually sorrowful, and for this cause the LYBIANS do mock the EGYPTIANS for that they fable; the same day that the lit∣tle Dog-star riseth, their ORIX speaketh. But on the contrarie themselues acknowledge, that as often as the said starre ariseth with the sunne, al their goates turne to the East, and looke vpon it, and this obseruation of the Goates, is as certaine as anie rule of the Astro∣nomers. The LYBIANS affirme more, that they doe presage great store of raine, Plutarch Elianus. and change of weather. The Egyptians also say, that when the Moone commeth neare to the East, they looke very intentiuely vpon her, as vpon their sufferaign Goddesse, and make a great noise, and yet they say they doe it not for her loue, but for her hate, which appeareth by knocking their Legges against the ground, and fastening their eies vpon the earth, like them which are angry at the Moones appearance: And the selfe same thing they do at the rising of the Sunne. For which cause the auncient Kings had an obseruer, or one to tell them the time of the day, sitting vpon one of these beasts, whereby very accurately they perceiued the sun rysing; and this they did by turning their taile against it and emptying their bellies, for which cause by an Orix the Egyptians discipher an impure or Godlesse wretch: for seeing that all creatures are nourished by the Sunne and Moone, and therefore ought to reioyce at their appearing, onely this filthy wretch disdaineth and scorneth them. The reason why they reioyce at the little Dogge-starre is, because their bodies doe perceiue an euident alteration of the time of the yeare, that cold weather and raine are o∣uerpassed, and that the vapors of the warm Sun are now descending vpon the earth, to cloth it withall manner of greene and pleasant hearbs and flowers. There is another kind of Orix which according to Columella, was wont to be impaled among Deere and Harts, the flesh whereof was eaten, and vsed for the commodity of his Maister: This was impatient of cold. It grew til it was foure yeares old, and afterwardes through age decreased, and lost all naturall vigor. But to returne to the Orix entended, from which we haue digressed; their Horns where∣of we late spake, are not onely stronge and sharpe like the Horne of the Vnicorne and the Rhinocerot, but also solide, & not hollow like the hornes of Harts. The courage and inward disposition of this beast, is both fearefull, cruell and valiant, I meane fearefull to men and beastes, but fearelesse in it selfe: For saith my Author; Ne{que} enim canis latratum timet, ne{que} apri efferuescentem feritatem, ne{que} tauri mugitum refugit, ne{que} Pantherarum tristem vocem, ne{que} ipsius Leonis vehementem rugitum horret, ne{que} item hominum robore mouetur, ac saepe ro∣bustum venatorem occidit : That is to say, He feareth not the barking of the Dogge, nor the foaming wrath of the wilde Boare, he flyeth not the terrible voyce of the Bull, nor yet the mournefull cry of the Panthers, no, nor the vehement roaring of the Lyon himselfe, and to conclude, he is not moued for all the strength of man, but many times killeth the valiantest hunter that pursueth him. When he seeth a Boare, a Lyon, or a Beare, presently he bendeth his hornes downe to the earth, whereby he conformeth and establisheth his head to receiue the brunt, stand∣ing in that manner till the assault be made: at which time hee easily killeth his aduersary, for by bending downe his head, and setting his hornes to receiue the beast, he behaueth himselfe as skilfully as the hunter, that receiueth a Lion vpon his speare. For his hornes do easily runne into the brests of any wilde beast, & so piercing them, causeth the blood to issue, whereat the beast being moued, forgetteth his combate and falleth to licking vp his owne blood, and so he is easily ouerthrowne. When the fight is once begunne, there is none of both that may runne awaie, but standeth it out vntil one or both of them bee to the ground, and so their dead bodies are many times found by wilde and sauage men. They fight with all, and kil one another, also they are annoyed with LYNCES, I meane the greater LYNCES: of the cruelty of this beast Martiall made this distichon: Matutinarum non vltima praeda ferarum Saevus Oryx, constat qui mihi morte canum. It is reported of this beast, Oppianus. Pliny. Albertus. that it liueth in perpetual thirst, neuer drinking by reason that there is no water in those places where it is bred, and that there is in it a certaine bladder of lickor, whereof whosoeuer tasteth, shall neuer neede to drinke. This beast liueth in the wildernesse, and notwithstanding his magnanimious and vnresistable strength, wrath, and cruelty, yet is hee easily taken by snares and deuices of men, for God which hath armed to take Elephants and tame Lyons, hath likewise iudewed them with knowledge from a∣boue, to tame and destroy al other noisome beast. Concerning the picture of this beast, and the liuely vissage of his exterior or outward parts, I cannot expresse it, because neither my owne sight, nor the the writinges of anye credible Author, doth giue me sufficient direction to deliuer the shape thereof vnto the world, and succeeding Ages vppon my credit: and therefore the Reader muste pardon me heerein. I do not also read of the vse of the flesh or any other partes of this beast, but onely of the hornes as is already expressed, whereunto I may adde the relation of Strabo who affirmeth the Aethiopians Silli do vse the hornes of these beastes in warres insteed of swords and speares: for incredible is the hardnes and sharpenes of them, which caused Iu∣venall to write thus: Et Getulus Oryx hebeti lautissima ferro Coeditur. For althogh of the owne length they are not able to match a pike, yet are they fit to be put vpon the tops of pikes, as well as any other artifical thing made of steel or yron, and thus I will conclude the story of this beast. OF THE OTTER. T Here is no doubt but this beast is of the kind of Beuers, be∣cause it liueth both on the Water and on the land, and the outward form of the parts beareth a similitude of that beast. The Italians doe vulgarly call this beast Lodra, of the na es thereof. and the Latines besides Lutra, Fluuiatulis Canicula, A Dogg of the Waters, and some cal them cats of the waters. The Italians besides Lodra call it also Lodria, and Lontra. The French Vne Loutre, or Vnge Loutre. The Sauoyans Vne Leure ; the Spaniards Nutria, and the Ilyrians Widra ▪ the Graecians Ly∣tra, because it shereth assunder the roots of the trees in the bankes of the riuers. Some of the Graecians cal it enhydris, although properly that bee a snake liuing in the Waters, called by Theodorus and Hermolaus, Lutris. Albertus calleth it Luter, and Anadrz for Enydris. Also Boatus by Syluacicus, and the Graecians cal filthy and thicke waters Lutrai ; for▪ which cause, when their Noble ancient Women went to bathe themselues in water, Stephanus they were bound about with skinnes called Oan Loutrida, that is, a sheepes skin vsed to the water. The French men call the dung of an OTTER Espranite de loutres, Pliny. the steppes of an OTTER Leise Marches, the whelpes of an OTTER Cheaux, by which word they call also the whelpes of Wolues, Foxes, and Badgers. Although they be a kind of Beauer as we haue saide already, yet they neuer goe into the Sea, The places o heir bod and they abound almost in all Nations, where there are riuers or fish-pooles, as namely in Italy, France, Germany, Heluetia, England, and Scandiuania. Likewise in all SAR∣MATIA, in the bay of BORISTHINES. They are most plentifull in ITALY, where the Riuer PADVS is ioyned to the sea. Also they abound in NAPLES. Their outward forme is most like vnto a BEAVER, Hermo aus. sauing in their taile, for the taile of a BEAVER is fish, but the taile of an OTTER is flesh. They are lesse then BEAVERS, some compare them vn∣to cat, and some vnto a Fox, but I cannot consent vnto the Fox. Olaus. They are bigger then a cat and longer, but lesser then a Fox, and therfore in my opinion they are well called dogs of the water. They exceede in length, for in Swetia and all the Northern riuers they are three times so long as a Beauer. They haue a rough skin, The seuerall parts. and the haire of it very soft and neate, like the haire of a Beauer, but different in this, that it is shorter and vnequal, also of colour like a Ches-nut, or brownish, but the Beauers is white or ashe colour. It hath very sharp teeth, and is a very biting beast, likewise short legs, and his feet and taile like a dogs, which caused Bellonius to write, that if his taile were off, he were in all parts like a Beauer, differing in nothing but his habitation. For the Beauer goeth both to the salt waters, and to the fresh, but the Otter neuer to the salt. Although it liue in the waters, yet it doth no sucke in water, but aire; that is, The framing of their den. it doth not breath like fishes through the benefit of water, and therefore it maketh his dens neer the water, wherein also they are wont to bring forth their young ones: They make their dens so artificially euen as the Beuer, with bowes, and sprigs, or sticks, couching together in excellent order, wherein he sitteth to keepe him from wetnesse. It hunteth fishes, and although it breatheth like another foure-footed-beast, yet will it remain a great while vn∣der the water without respiration, for the greedinesse of fishes it runneth many time into nets which are set by men in waters to take fish, whereinto being entered, His prey and foode. it is suffocated for want of breath, before it can sheare asunder the nets and make way for himselfe to come out. For in the hunting of fish it must often put his nose aboue the water to take breath: it is of a wonderfull swiftnesse and nimblenesse, in taking his prey, and filleth his den so full of fishes that he corrupteth the aire, or men that take him in his den: and likewise infect∣eth himselfe with a pestilent and noysome sauour, whereupon as the Latins say of a stink∣ing fellow; he smels like a Goat, so the Germans say of the same; He smels like an Otter. Agricola. In the winter time he comes out of the caues and waters to hunt vpon the land, wher finding no other foode, he eateth fruits, and the barke of trees. Bellonius writeth thus of him, Albertus. he keepeth in pooles and quiet waters and riuers, terrifieng the flockes of fish, and driuing them to the bank-sides in great number, to the holes and creekes of the earth, where hee taketh them more copiously, and more easie: but if he want prey in the waters, then doth he leape vpon the land, and eate vpon greene hearbs: he will swim two miles together a∣gainst the streame, putting himselfe to great labor in his hunger, that so when his belly is full, the currant of streame may carry him downe againe to his designed lodging. The females nourish many whelps together at their vdders, vntill they be almost as big as themselues, for whom the hunters search, as for the dams among the leaues & boughes which the ouerflowings of waters in the winter time, haue gathered together and laide on heapes It is a sharp-biting-beast, hurtfull both to men and dogs, neuer ceasing or loosing hold after he hath laid his mouth vpon them, vntill he make the bones to cracke betwixt his teeth, whereupon it was well said by Olaus Mag. Lutrae mordaces quadrato ore. Otters are most accomplished biters. It is a very crafty and subtill beast, yet it is sometimes tamed, and vsed in the Northern parts of the world, especially in Scandinauia to driue the fishes into the fisher mens nets: for so great is the sagacity and scence of smeling in this beast, that he can directly winde the fishes in the waters a mile or two off, and therefore the Fishers make great aduantage of them, yet doe they forbeare his vse because he deuoureth more then needeth, for he is neuer so ta¦med that he forgeteth his old rauening, being tamed, on the lande he is very full of sport and game. I maruaile how it came into the writers heads to affirme, that the Beauer constraineth the Otter in the winter time, to trouble the water about her taile, to the intent it may not frieze, which opinion we haue confuted already in the discourse of the Beauer, for herein I agree with Albertus. Fiber fortior est lutra, & acutissimis dentibus, qua propter eam vel expellit, vel occidit. The Beauer is much stronger then the Otter, hauing also most sharp teeth, and therfore either expelleth her out of the waters, because they liue both vpon one kind of food, or else destroys her: where¦fore it is vnreasonable to beleeue that he preserueth her to keepe his taile from freezing. The flesh of this beast is both cold and filthy, because it feedeth vpon stinking fish, and therefore not fit to be eaten. Tragus writeth that this notwith∣standing is dressed to bee eaten in many places of Germany, and I hear that the Carthusian Fryers or Monkes (whether you wil) which are forbidden to touch al manner of flesh, of other foure-footed-beasts, yet they are not prohibited the eating of Otters. . These Otters are hun∣ted with speciall Dogges, called Otter-Houndes, and also with speciall instru∣ments called Otter-speares, hauing ex∣ceeding sharp points: for they are hard¦ly taken, and beasts doe not willingly set vpon them, specially in the waters: when they feele themselues to bee wounded with the speare, then they come to land, where they fight with the dogs very ire∣fully, and except they be first wounded, they forsake not the waters: for they are not ignorant how safe a refuge the Wa¦ters are vnto them, and how vnequall a combat they shall sustaine with men and dogs vppon the lande, yet because the cold water anoyeth their green wounds, therefore they spin out their liues to the length of the thread, chusing rather to die in tor∣ments among dogs, then to die in the waters. There is a kind of Assa called Benioyn, a strong hearb which being hung in a linnen cloth near fish-ponds, driueth away al Otters & Beuers. The hair of the skin is most soft, neither doth it leese his beauty by age; for which cause as also for that no raine can hurt it when it is well dressed, it is of great price and estimation, Albertus and is sold for seuen or eight shillings: thereof also they make fringes in the hems of gar∣ments, and face about the collers of men and Womens garments, and the skinne of the OTTER is farre more pretious then the skinne of the BEAVER; and for this cause the SVETIAN merchants do transport many into MOSCOVIA and TARTARIA for clokes and other garments. Thereof also in Germany they make caps, or else line other caps with them, and also make stocking-soles; affirming that they bee good and wholsome against the Palsie, Vse of their Skins▪ the megrim, and other paines of the head. The bloud of an OTTER is prescribed against the swelling of the Nerues. The Liuer dryed in an Ouen against the bloody-flixe, and against the collick being drunke in wine. The stones are also prescribed to be giuen against the falling sicknesse and all paines in the belly. And thus much for the OTTER. There be certaine beastes which are kindes of OTTERS, which because they liue in the Waters, and yet being vnknowne to vs in England, I haue thought good to expresse them in this place by their Greeke and Latine names. In the first place that which the Graecians call Latax, broader and thicker then an Otter, and yet liueth in the Waters or else goeth to the waters for his food, yet breatheth aire and not water like Otters. The haire of this beast is very harsh, betwixt the similitude of a Sea-Calfe and a Hart, and it hath also strong and sharp teeth, wherewithal in the night season they shere asunder smal boughes and twigs: It is called also Fastoz, Lamyakyz, and Noertza. There is another called Satyrium, and Fassuron, and Chebalus, whose skin is black, and very pretious and very much vsed for the edging of the best garments, these liue also in ponds, lakes, and still waters. There is a third kinde called Satherium, Kacheobeon, and Kachyneen, and Martarus, ha∣uing a white throate, and being as bigge as a Cat; and finally vnto these may be added Porcos, a foure-footed-beaste liuing in the Waters in the Riuer Isther : And Maesolus ano∣ther foure-footed-beast liuing in some Ryuers of INDIA, being as big as a Calfe. Of the Panther, commonly called a Pardall, a Leopard, and a Libbard. T Here haue beene so many names deuised for this one beast, that it is growen a difficult thing, either to make a good reconciliation of the authors which are wed to their seueral opinions, or else to define it perfectly and make of him a good methodicall History: yet seeing the grea∣test variance hath arisen from wordes, The seuerall names of Panthers. and that which was deuised at the first for the better explication and discrip∣tion of it hath turned to the obscuration and shaddowing of the truth, I trust it shall be a good labour to collect out of euery writer that which is most probable concerning this Beast, and in the end to expresse the best definition thereof wee can learne out of all. First of all therefore for as much as all the question hath arisen from the Greeke and Latine names, it is most requisite to expresse them, and shew how the different construc∣tion began. The Graecians do indifferently call it Pordalis, Pardalis, and Panther, the La∣tins Panthera, Pardalis, Pardus, and Leopardus, and these names are thus distinguished by the learned. Pordalis they say signifieth the male, and Pardalis the female, and also Pan∣thera among the Latins for the female, and Pardus for the male, and these are vnderstood of a simple kind without commixture of generation. Leopardus the Lepard or Libbard, is a word deuised by the later writers, compounded of Leo and Pardus, vpon opinion that this beast is generated betwixt a Pardall and a Lyon, and so indeede it ought properly to bee taken, if there be any such. Pliny is of opinion that Pardus differeth from Panthera in no∣thing but in sexe, and other say that betwixt the Lyons and the Pardalles there is such a confused mixed generation as is betwixte Asses and Mares, or Stallions and Asses, as for example, when the Lyon couereth the Pardall, then is the Whelpe called Leopardus, a Leopard or Libbard, but when the Pardal coureth the Lionesse, then is it called Panthe∣ra a Panther. In this controuersie the Hebrew and Arabian names which are generally indifferently translated Panthers or Libbards, doe take vp the strife and almost end the controuersie, for Namer in Hebrew, and Alphec or Alfhed in Arabique, are so translated both in holy scripture, and also in Auicen, as may appeare by these places following Esa. 11. Habitabit Lupus cum agno, & (Namer) Pardus, cum hedo a cubabit. That is to say, The Wolfe shall dwell with the Lambe, and the Pardall, Libbard, and Panther, shall lye with the Kid. So in the vision of Daniel chap. 7. among the foure beastes comming out of the Sea, the pro∣phet seeth Namer a Leopard. In the 13. Reuela. of S. Iohn, he seeth another beast rising out of the sea, hauing ten hornes, and hee saith it was like Pardalet, which Erasmus translateth Pardo, a Leopard. Ieremy 5. Pardus (Namer) vigelat super ciuitatem corum, vt omnen inde egredientem discrepat. That is, a panther or Pardal watcheth at the gates of the Citty, that he may teare in pieces euery one that commeth forth. Factus sum eis sicut Leo, & sicut Pardus (sicut Namer) directus ad viam suam. For Namer in that place the Graecians translate Pardalis, a Pardall. In the 13. Ieremy Si mutare potest Aethiops pellem suam, aut Pardus ma∣culas suas, & vos poteritis bene facere, cum didiceritis malum. If the Blackamoore can change his skin, or the Leopard his spots, then may you do wel which haue learned to do it. Canti∣cles 4. Coronaberis de vetrice saner, & hermon, de cubilibus Leonem de montibus Pardorum. That is, Thou shalt be crownd frō the top of Siner and Hermon, from the dens of the Ly∣ons, and the Mountains of the Leopards. Now according to Brocardus the Mountaine of the Leopards is distant from Tripolis in the holy land two leagues. Rasis & Auicen, two Arabians do cal the Panther and Leopard by one name, Alpheth, or Alphil, so that by com∣paring all these together the Panther, Pardall, Libbard, and Leopard, are but one beast, called by diuers names. A more ex∣a t definiti∣on of Pa ∣d l and Leo¦pard . For the farther manifesting heerof, it is good to examine, what is said of the Pardal and Leopard in particular, that so hauing expressed that, it may be cleare by the discourse succeeding▪ that there is no difference betwixt them and the Panther, or very small. First of all therefore it said of the Pardus, that it differeth not from the Pan∣ther but onely in sexe, and that the skin hath receiued a naturall tincture of diuers spots. Aristotle writeth thus of it, Cutis chamaeliontis distincta maculis vt Pardalia. The skin of the Chamaelion is spotted like a Pardals, and in the relation of Lampridius, where hee sheweth how Heliogabalus was wont to shut vp his drunken friendes: Cum Leonibus, Leopardus, & vrsis, ita vt experge facti in cubiculo eodem Leones, vrsos Pardos cum luce, vel quod est graui∣us nocte inuenierent, ex quo pleri{que} ex animati sunt, and so forth: By which words it is apparant that those which in the first place he calleth Leopards, in the last place he calleth Pardals, and the onely difference betwixt the Leopard, Pardall, and Lyon, is that the Leoparde or Pardal haue no manes: and therefore they are cal∣led Ignobiles leones. Isidorus, and Solinus write in this maner: Pardus secundum post Pan∣thera est genus varium ac velocissimum, & praceps ad sanguinem, saltu enim ad mortem ruit, ex ad vlterio Pardi & Leenis, Leu pardus nascitur, & tertiam originem efficit. That is to say, the Pardal is the next kind to a Panther, being diuers coloured & very swift, gree∣dy after blood, and ketcheth his prey by leaping: the Leopard is bred betwixt the Pardal and the Lionesse, and so that maketh a third kind, by which testimony it apeareth, that these names make three seuerall kinds of beastes, not distinct in nature but in quantity, through commixture of generation. The greatest therefore they call Panthers, as Bellunensis writeth. The second they call Pardals, and the third least of all they call Leopards, which for the same cause in England is called a Cat of the Mountain. And truely in my opinion, vntill some other can shew me better reason I will subscribe hereunto, namely that they are all one kinde of beast, and differ in quantitie onely through adulterous generation. For in Affrick there is great want of waters, and therefore the lyons, Panthers, and other beasts doe assemble them∣selues in great numbers together at the running riuers, where the Pardals, and the lyons doe engender one with another: I meane the greater Panthers with the lyonesses, Baytius. and the greater lyons with the Panthers; and so likewise the smaller with the smaller, & there∣by it commeth to passe that some of them are spotted, and some of them without spots. The Pardal is a fierce and cruell beast very violent, Pliny. hauing a body and mind like ra∣uening birds, and some say they are ingendred now and then betwixt dogs and Panthers, or betwixt leopards and dogges, euen as the Lycopanthers are ingendred betwixt wolues and panthers. It is the nature of these pardals in Affrick to get vp into the rough and thicke trees, where they hide themselues amongest the boughes and leaues, and doe not onely take birds, but also from thence leape downe vpon beasts and men when they espie their aduantage, and all these things doe belong vnto the panthers. Concerning the Leopard the word it selfe is new and lately inuented, Of the Leo∣pard. for it is neuer found among any of the auncients before Iulius Capitolinus, or Sparsianus. Syluaticus, maketh no difference betwixt pardalis and Leopardus, and the Italians generally call a pardal Leopardo, and neuer pardo, except some of the Poets, for breuitie sake in a verse. The leopard is like to a lyon in the head and forme of his members, but yet he is lesser and nothing so strong, by the sight of a leopards skinne Gesner made this description of the beast. The length (saith he) from the head to the taile, was as much as a mans stature, and halfe a cubite. The taile of it selfe three spans and a halfe, the breadth in the middle three spans, the colour a bright yellow distinguished into diuers spots, the haire short and mossie. The price of the skin was about fiue nobles or fortie shillings, for they differ in price, according to the regions out of which they are brought, they which come furthest are sold dearest, and they which come lesse way are sold cheapest. It is a wrathfull and an angry beast, and whensoeuer it is sicke it thirsteth after the blood of a wilde cat, and reco∣uereth by sucking that blood, or else by eating the dung of a man. Aboue all other things it delighteth in the Camphorey tree, and therefore lieth vnder neath it, to keepe it from spoile, and in like sort the panther delighteth in sweet gums and spices, and therefore no maruel if they cannot abide garlicke, because it annoyeth their sence of smelling: And it is reported by S. Ambrose, that if the wals of ones howse or sheep-coat be anointed with the iuice of Garlicke, both panthers and Leopards will run away from it, Albertus. but of this mat∣ter we shal saie more afterwards. The Leopard is sometimes tamed, and vsed in stead of a Dog for hunting, both among the TARTARIANS and other Princes, for they carry them behinde them on Horse∣backe, and when they see a Deere or Hart, or conuenient prey, they turne them downe vppon them suddainely, who take them and destroy them; yet such is the nature of this beast, as also of the PARDALL, that if hee doe not take his prey at the fourth or fift iump, he falleth so angry and fierce, that he destroyeth whomsoeuer he meeteth, yea many times his hunter. Therefore the hunters haue alwaies a regard to carry with them a lambe or a kid, or some such liue thing, wherewithall they pacifie him after he he hath missed his game, for without blood he will neuer be appeased: and thus much shall suffice to haue spoken of the difference betwixt Panthers, Pardals, and Leopards, and their seuerall names in Greeke and Latine, from whom almost all nations doe deriue their denomination, The names in other lan∣guages. for the Italians call it Leonpardo, the French Leopard, and Lyopard, the Germans Leppard, and Lefarad, and Pantherthier, the Spaniards Leonpardal, & Leopardo. The Illyrians Leuhart, the Caldeans Nimra, and some make no differenc betwixt this and the Arabian Wolfe: The reason of the Greeke word Pardalis, or Pordalis, (for they signifie both one) seemeth to me in most probabilitie to be deriued from the Hebrew word Pardes, signifying a Garden, because as colours in a Garden make it spotted and render a fragrant smell, so the Panther is diuers coloured like a Garden of sundry flow∣ers, and also it is said to carry with him a most sweete sauour whither soeuer he goeth, and therfore in auncient time they made their Iuory tables standing vpon pictures of Panthers, whereof Iuvenall writeth thus in one of his Satyres. Olim ex quauis arbore mensa fiebat At nunc diuitibus caenandi nulla voluptas ———nisi sustinet orbes. Grande ebur & magno sublimis Pardus biatu Dentibus ex illis quos mittit porta Hyenes Iam nimios capiti{que} graues, &c. For the same cause Pardalis was the name of a notable Harlot, for as the Panthers by their sweete smels drawe the beastes vnto them and then destroy them, so also doe harlots decke and adorne themselues with all alluring prouocations, as it were with in∣chaunted odors, to drawe men vnto them, of whom they make spoyle and rapine: Ther is a pretious stone also called Lapis Pantherus brought out of India, Euax. Syluaticus Albertus Ʋartoman whereupon if a man looke before the Sunne rising he shall see diuers colours, namely, blacke, red, greene, russet, purple, and rose colour, and they say it hath as many vertues as it hath colours, but I list not to follow the name any further. Countries of Panthers. The Countries breeding Panthers are Abasia in the kingdome of Melacha, in the Ile Sumatra. Likewise in ASIA, especially Syria, for there are none in Europe, all Affricke ouer they are plentiful, as in Lybia and Mauritania, where abound al store of wilde beasts. Likewise beyond Catadupa, for Apollonius and his companions saw there many Lyons & Panthers. In Arabia the furthest part, namly the promontory of Dyra towards the south, are the strongest Pardals of the world, as saith Strabo :) Likwise in the Mediteranean region beyond Barygaza toward the South, vnto Dachinabades, and towards the East are al sorts of wilde beasts, both Tygres and panthers: (and Diodorus writeth) that in that part of A∣rabia ioyning vpon Syria, there Lyons and pardals are both more in number and grea∣ter in quantity then in Lybia. Also it is said by Volateranus and Gyllius that the panther of Lycia and Caria are verye long, but yet weake and without carriage, being not able to leape farre, yet is their skin so hard as no yron can pierce. Betwixt the riuer Ganges and Hiphasis, Apollonius saw many panthers. Leo Affri The Indians also breed many and make them tame, and leopards do liue in the woods of BARBARIA. The seuerall parts of Pan∣thers. It is apparant by that which is already saide, that the Panther is the name of the greater pardall, and the Leopard of the lesser, which the Arabians call Alnemer, and Alfhead, Alne∣mer is bigger then a Linx, but like a Leopard, hauing greater and sharper nailes and feete, blacke and terrible eies, and therefore stronger, fiercer, and bolder then the Leoparde, for it setteth vppon men, and destroyeth them. Oppianus describeth both kinds in this manner. There are (saith he) two kindes of pardals, a greater and a lesser, the greater are broader backt, and bigger in quantity, the lesser being lesse in quantity, but not inferior in strength: both of them haue the same shape and colour of body, except in their taile: for the greater pardall hath the lesser taile and the lesser the greater: either of them haue solid and sound thighs, a very long body, bright seeing eies, the Apples whereof do gli∣ster vnder their eye-lids, which are gray and red within like to burning coales, their teeth pale and venemous, their skin of diuers colors, yet bright and pleasant, the spots standing like so many black eies vpon it, Thus far Oppianus. Such skins are oftentimes solde in the marts of Europe which are broght in bundles twenty or thirty togither, and it is not to be forgotten, which Volateran citeth out of Aelianus, that ther is in this kind of pardals a beast called Bitis, not vnlike to the vulgar Leopards in al parts, except that it wanteth a tail; & they say that if this beast be seene by a woman, it will instantly make her to be sick; but to proceed to the residue of the parts of these beasts, we must remember that which Aristo∣tle writeth in his physiognomy; as is recorded by Adamantius: Leo perfectissimam maris ideam praese fert Pardalis vero foemineam formum ex primit crucibus tantū exceptis, quibus ad inuadendum fortiter vtitur, that is to say: Among all beasts the lyon doeth most resemble the male, and the pardall the female, except in the legs which she vseth to take her prey. It hath a little face, a little mouth, little eies, somewhat white, plaine, and not much ho∣low, a long forehead, eares rather round then smooth or broad, a necke very longe and slender, the brest not wel set out with ribs, because they are small, the backe long, the but∣tockes and thighes very fleshy, the partes about the small of the belly or loines are more smooth, lesse hollow and bunchy; the colour diuers, and the whole body in articulate, & not well compounded for the outward sight: and it is to be remembred (saith Carden ) that all rauening beasts are like a Cat, as Lyons, panthers, Linces, and pardals, for they haue in common the length and strength of their claws, beautiful party coloured skins, alitle head and round face, a long taile, nimblenes of body, and wildnes of nature, liuing vppon the meat they get in hunting. The Persians call a pardall Barbact, and Scaliger describeth it thus. In his red or yellow haire he is like a Lyonesse, but set with diuers blacke spots both in length and bredth, as if they were painted. It hath a browne face, aspersed with blacke and white, and it is to bee remembred, that as other beasts are either all blacke, or all red, or all white, or all of one colour by nature, so also it is natural to pea-cockes and panthers, to haue diuers colours in them, for there are in Hircania panthers with little round spottes like eies, both blacke, Albertus. Pliny. white, blew, and green, as both Solinus and Claudius testifie, which caused Martial to write thus; Picto quod iuga delicata collo pardus sustinet. There is a land called Terra eremborum inhabited by the Troglodites and Sarazens in Ly∣bia, where the vper face of the earth is campared vnto the panthers skin, because through the heat of the sun it is burned, and died as it were into diuers colors, so that ye shal see di∣uers spots of white, black, and green earth, as if it wer done of purpose by the hand of man. The teeth of the panther are like sawes, as are also a Dogs and a Lyons: theyr tongue of such incredible sharpenesse, that in licking it grateth like a file. The females haue foure vdders in the midst of their belly, the heart is great in proporti∣on, because he is a violent beast, terifieng man. There are many fissures in their feet. Aristotle. Their former feet haue fiue distinct claws or fingers, and their hinder feet but four, for litle ones among foure-footed-beasts haue fiue fingers vpon their hinder fret: when they go, they hide their nailes within the skinne of their feet, as it were in sheaths, neuer bringing them forth but when they are in their prey, to the intent they should neuer be broken nor dul∣led. Their tails haue no long haires at the end like a Lyons or Oxes, and the Leopa d hath a wider mouth then the pardall. The female is oftener times taken then the male, the reason is giuen by Volateran, be∣cause she is inforced to seeke abroad for her owne meate and her yoong ones. The place of their aboad is among the mountaines and woods, The food of Panthers. and especially they delight in the tree Camphorie. They rauen vpon flesh both birdes and beastes: for which cause they hide themselues in trees, especially in Mauritania, where they are not very swift of foote, & therefore they giue themselues to take Apes, which they attaine by this pollicy: when they see the apes, they make after thē, who at their first approching climbe into the tops of trees, & there sit to auoyd the Panthers teeth, for she is notable to follow thē so hie, but yet she is more cunning then the Apes, and therefore diuiseth more shifts to take them, that where nature hath denied hir bodily power, there she might supply that want by the gifts of the mind. Forth therefore shee goeth, and vnder the tree where the Apes are lodged, she lieth downe as though she were deade, stretching out her limbes, and restraining her breath, shutting her eyes, and shewing all other token of expiration. The Apes that sitte on the toppes of the Tree behold from on high the behauiour of their aduersary, and be∣cause al of them wish her dead, they more easily beleeue that which so much they desire, & yet dare not descend to make tryall. Then to end their doubtes, they chuse out one from among them all, whom they thinke to be of the best courage, and him they send downe as it were for an espy, to certifie al the residue: forth then he goeth with a thousand feares in his mind, and leapeth from bough to bough with no great hast, (for dread of an il bar∣gain ) yet being come downe, dareth not approach nigh, but hauing taken a view of the counterfeite, and repressed his owne feare, returneth backe againe: After a little space he descendeth the second time, and commeth nearer the panther then before, yet returneth without touching him. Then he discendeth the third time, looking into his eies, and ma∣ke h tryall whether hee draweth breath or no, but the PANTHER keepeth both breath and lims immouable, by that means imboldning the Apes to their owne destruction; for the spy-Ape sitteth down beside the Panther and stirreth not: now when those which are aboue in the tree, see how their intelliger abideth constantly beside their aduersary with∣out harme, they gather their spirits togither and discend downe in great multitudes, run∣ning about the panther, first of all going vpon him, and afterwards leaping with great ioy and exultation, mocking this their aduersary with al their apish toyes, and testifieng their ioy for hir supposed death: and in this sort the Panther suffereth them to continew a great reason, til he perceiueth they are throughly wearied, and then vpon a sudden hee leapeth vp aliue againe, taking some of them in his claws, destroying and killing them with teeth and nailes, til he haue prepared for himself a rich dinner out of his aduersaries flesh. And like as Vlysses endeuored all the contumelies and reproaches, both of his maids and wiues suiters, vntill he had a iust occasion giuen him of reuenge, so doth the Panther the disdain∣full dealing of the Apes: whereupon came the prouerbe, Pardi mortem assimulat, Thana∣ton pardaleos hypocrimetai, against a cunning dissembling fellow, such a one as Brutus was, who counterfatted madnes that he might get the Empire. So great is the loue of this beast to all spices and aromaticall trees, that they come o∣uer all the mountaine Taurus through Armenia and Silia, when the winds bring the sauor of the sweet gum vnto them, Their loue pices. out of Pamphilia from the tree Storax : whereupon lyeth this story. There was a certaine panther which was taken by king Arsaces, and a Golden collor put vpon his necke, with this inscription: Rex Arsaces deo Nisaeo, that is, King Arsaces to the God Bacchus : for Bacchus was called Nisaey of a citty Nisa in India. This Beast grew ve∣ry tame, and would suffer himselfe to be handled and stroked by the hands of men, vntill the spring time that he winded the sauour of the Aromatical trees, and then he would run away from all his acquaintance, according to his kind, and so at last was taken in the nea∣ther part of the mountaine Taurus, which was many hundred miles distant from the kings court of Armenia. The sauor or mel of Pan∣thers. We haue shewed already how they loue the gum of Camphorey, watching that tree, to the end to preserue it for their owne vse, and indeed as Aelianus saith: Admirabilem quan∣tam odoris suavitatem olet pardalis, quam bene olendi praestatiam deuino munere donatam, cum sibi propriam plane tenet, tum vero caetera animalia eius hanc vni praeclare sentiunt : that is to say, the Panther or Pardall smelleth most sweetly, which sauor he hath receiued from a diuine gift, and doth not onely feele the benefit of it himselfe, but also bewray it vnto o∣ther beasts: Aristotle. Vol teranus. for when he feeleth himself to be hungry and stand in need of meat, then doth he get vp into some rough tree, and by his savour or sweet smel, draweth vnto him an in∣numerable company of wilde Goats, Harts, Roes, and Hinds, and such other beasts, and so vpon a sudden leapeth downe vpon them, when he espyeth his couenient time. And Solinus sayth, that the sweetnesse of his sauor worketh the same effect vppon them in the open fieldes, for they are so mightily delighted with his spotted skin and fragrant smell, that they wil alwaies come running vnto him from all parts, striuing who shal come nearest him to be satisfied with the sight, but when once they looke vppon his fierce and grim face, they all are terrified and turne away: for which cause the subtle beast, turneth away his head and keepeth that from their sight, offering the more beautiful parts of his body, as an alluring bayt to a mouse and destroy them: and from hence there are some which are of opinion, that he receiueth his name Panthera, of congregating togither all kind of beasts to look on him, for Pan signifieth all, and Therta signifieth beasts. Isidorus. Albertus is of opinion that the report of the Panthers sauour or sweet smell is but a fable, because (he saith) it is written as a Maximum among Philosophers, that Caetera animalia praeter homi∣nem ne{que} suaviter ne{que} moleste odoribus affici, that is: That no creatures (man excepted) can be said to smell either sweetly or sowerly, and Theophrastus writeth: Animal nullum penetus odoratum est nisi quis dixerit pardalin, belluarum censui bene olere, that is: There is no crea∣ture that can be said to be so odorifirous, except the pardal seem to smel wel to the scents of other beasts: for it is certain that there be som sauours and smels which beastes do fol∣low and refuse, being led thereunto onely for the choice of their meate: for by their no∣ses they choose that which is conuenient & agreeable to their natures, but that they shold be drawn by any smels or sauours meerly, and for no other cause but the pleasure of the scents, as it is a reasonable part in man, so it is vnreasonable, to attribute the very same vn∣to a beast. Yet heerein by the fauour of Albertus I discent from him, for it being granted which all men yeeld vnto, that either the spots of his skin, which seeme to be as many eies as co∣lours, or els the sweet sauour which commeth from him as the occasion of the beasts as∣sembling about him; then it followeth that when he is from the earth and lodged in a tree, and so not visible to the eies of the beasts, if then I say they assemble about the tree where∣in he is lodgd, there is no cause to draw the beastes vnto him, but the attractiue power of his sweete sauour: and what want of reason can it be iustly deemed to say that beasts loue sweet sauours, seeing both Albertus, and al other learned men that I know do confident∣ly affirme, that many wilde beasts do forsake their meat to heare musick, and also the Bad∣ger doth forsake his owne den when he perceiueth the Foxe hath emptied his bellye therein. Therefore I will conclude this point with admiration of the worke of the creator, to consi∣der how wisely he hath disposed his goodnesse, and how powerfully hee communicateth the affections of his diuinity euen vnto brute beasts, who doth not distinguish them asun∣der onely by their outsides and exterior partes, nor yet by their insides and qualities of their minds, but also by the ayre they draw in, and the sauour they send forth. Among all kinds of Beastes the male is most couragious and fierce, except in Beares and panthers, for the female panther is more generous then the male. At the time of their lust, they haue very peculiar voices, which caused the poet to write thus: Their time of lust. Panther caurit amans, Pardus hiando felit. At the sound of those voices other beasts come about them, as both Lyons, Lyonesses, Wolues, and Thoes. They neuer bear aboue once, because when the young ones begin to stirre in the dams belly, and gather strength for birth, they canot tarry the iust time of their deliuery, but teare out the womb or bag wherein they lie with the sharpnes of their nails and therefore their dam is forced for the auoiding of pain to cast them forth of the womb both blind and deformed, which yet she norisheth tenderly, but afterwards can ne¦uer conceiue againe, by reason that her wombe is so torne with the clawes of her firste whelpes, that it is not able to retaine to perfection the receiued seed of the male. Panthers liue togither in flockes or heards, Their loue and hatred, enemies and friends and greatly delight in their owne kind but in no other that I knowe, and therefore I wonder from what Author Isidorus wrote. Pan∣ther omnium animalium amicus est excepto Dracone ; That the panther is friendly to al beasts except the Draggon. It was not in vaine that the poets feigned the Nurses of Bacchus to bee turned into panthers, and that they deuoured Peutheus because he railed vppon Bac∣chus: for as a Lyon doeth in most thinges imitate and resemble the very nature of man, so after the very selfe-same manner doeth the panther of a Woman, for it is a fraudule t though a beautifull beast, or (as Adamantius writeth) Pantherae ingenium mol∣le est, effoeminatum, iracundum, in sidiosum, & frandulentum, timidum simul & audax, his moribus corporis etiam forma respondit: that is, The disposition of the Panther is wanton, effeminate, The descr p∣t n of . outragious, treacherous, deceiptfull, fearefull, and yet bold: and for this oc∣casion, in holy scriptures it is ioyned with the Lyon and the Wolfe, to make vp the tri∣plicity of rauening beasts: and therefore also we read, that the wisest among the EGYPTI∣ANS when they will signifie a cunning man couering the secret corruption and euil dispo∣sition of his mind, pretending good, and yet intending euill, they picture a PANTHER, for we haue shewed already how hee doeth couer both his heade and his bodie to take his prey. The aming of Panthers. This beast is neuer so tamed but that he faleth into his wilde fits againe. Their loue to their yong ones is exceeding great, for if at any time while they are abroad to forage, they meet with hunters that would take them away, they fight for them vnto death, and to saue them from blowes, interpose their owne bodies, receiuing mortall woundes, but if they find their young ones taken out of their denne in their absence, they bewaile their losse with loud and miserable howling. Demetrius the Phylosopher relateth this story of a Panther, that lay in the high waye to meet with a man to helpe hir young ones out of a ditch or deepe pit wherein they were fallen, at length there appeared in hir sight the father of Philinus a Phylosopher, who pre∣sently began to runne away as soone as he saw the beast, but the poore distressed Panther rouled after him in humble maner, as though she had some sute vnto him, and took him lightly by the skirt of his garment with one of her clawes: the man perceiuing that shee gaue sucke by the greatnesse of her Vdders hanging vnder her belly, beganne to take pit∣ty vpon her, and layed away feare, thinking that indeed which happened, that her young ones were taken from her by one meanes or other; therefore he followed hir, she draw∣ing him with one of her feet vnto the caue whereinto hir young ones were fallen, out of which he deliuered them to the mother as raunsome for his owne life, and then both shee and the young ones did follow him reioycing, out of the daunger of all beastes, and out of the wildernesse, dismissing him without all manner of harme, which is a rare thinge in a man to be so thankefull, and much more in a beast: and vnto this story of their loue and kindnesse to their young ones, I may adde another, woorthy to bee remembered out of Aelianus. A notable storie of a Panthers ue to his companion. There was (saith he) a man which brought vp a tame Panther from a whelpe, and had made it so gentle, that it refused no society of men, and he himselfe loued it as if it had bin his wife. There was also a little Kyd in the house brought vp tame, of purpose to be giuen vnto the Panther when it was growne to some stature or quantity, yet in the meane sea∣son the Panther plaied with it euery day: at last it being ripe, the maister killed it and layed it before the Panther to be eaten, but he would not touch it, wherevpon he fasted till the next day, and then it was brought vnto him againe, but he refused it as before, at last hee fasted the third daie, and making great moane for meat, according to his vsuall manner, had the Kyd laide before him the third time, the poore beast seeing that nothing woulde serue the turne, but that he must either eat vppe his chamber fellow, or else his mayster would make him continually fast, he ranne and killed another Kyd, disdaining to medle with that which was his former acquaintance, yea though it were dead; heerin excelling many wicked men, who doe not spare those that haue liued with them in the greatest fa∣miliarity and friendshippe, to vndooe and ouerthrow them aliue for the aduauncement of themselves. We haue saide already, that they most of all resemble Women, and indeed they are enimies to all creatures. The Leopards of BARBARY do little harme to men that they meet, The harmes of Panthers. except they meet them in some path waie where the man cannot decline the beast, nor the beast the man, there they leape most fiercely into his face, and pull awaie as much flesh as they can laie hold vpon, and manie of them with their nailes do pierce the brains of a man. Leo. Afer. Albertus. They vse not to inuade or force vpon flocks of sheepe or Goats, yet wheresoever they see a Dogge they instantly kill and devoure him. The great Panther is a tetror to the dra∣gon, and so soone as the Dragon seeth it, he flyeth to his caue. Auicen. The lesser Panthers or Leopards do ouercome Wolues being single, and hand to hand as we say, but by multi∣tude they ouermaister and destroy him, for if he endeuour to run away, yet they are swif∣ter and easily ouercome it. There is also great hatred and enmity betwixt the Hyaena and the Panther, for in the presence of the Hyaena, the Pardall dareth not resist, and that which is more admirable, Pliny. if there be a peece of an Hyaenaes skinne about either man or beast, Orus the Panther will ne∣uer touch it, & if their skins after they be dead be hung vp in the presence of one another, the haire will fall of from the Panther, and therefore when the Egyptians would signifie how a superiour was ouercome by a superiour, they picture those: two skinnes. The ter or of Panthers. Pliny Rasis Aesculapius. If any thing be annointed with broath wherein a Cocke hath beene sodden, neither Panthers nor Lyons will euer touch it, especially if there be mixed with it the iuce of Garlike. Leopards are afraid of a certaine tree called Leopardi arbor, Leopards-tree. Panthers are also afraid of the scull of a dead man, and runne from the sight thereof: yet it is repor∣ted that two yeare before the death of Francis King of France, two Leopards, a male and a female were let escape in France into the Woods, either by the negligence or the ma∣lice of their keepers, that is a male and a female, and about Orleance tore in peeces many men and Women; at last they came and killed a bride which was that day to haue beene married, and afterward there were found many carkases of Women destroyed by them, of which they had eaten nothing but onely their breastes: Such like thinges I might ex∣presse many in this place, whereby the vengeance of almighty God against mankind for many sins, might seeme to be executed by the raging ministery of wilde, sauage, and vn∣gentle beastes. For this cause we read in auncient time how the Senatours of Rome gaue lawes of pu∣nishment against them that should bring any Panthers into Italy, Lawes against Panthers especially any Affri∣can beastes: and the first that gaue dispensation against those lawes was Cneius Aufidius the peoples Tribune, who permitted them for the sake of the Circensian games: and then Scaurus in the office of his aedility brought also in an hundred and fifty: After him Pompey the great four hundered and ten, and lastly Augustus that euer remembred and re∣nowned Emperor, foure hundred and twenty. Thus lawes which were first made by great men and good Senators, for the safety of the common-wealth, became of no great valew, because as great or greater then the lawmakers, had a purpose to aduance themselues by the practise of those things which law had iustly forbidden, for if those decrees had stood effectuall, as the victorious Champions had loste that part of their vaine tryumphes, so many people had afterward beene preserued aliue, who by the cruelty of these beasts were either torne in peeces, or else receiued mortall wounds. It was not in vaine that the blessed martyr of Iesus Christ Ignatius, who was afterwards torne in peeces by wilde beastes at Rome, did write thus in his epistle to the Roman chri∣stians concerning his handling by the Roman Souldiers, as he was brought prisoner out of Syria to Rome. A Siria Romam vs{que} cum bestijs depugno per terram & mare die nocteque vinctus cum decem Leopardis, hoc est cum militari custodia, qui ex beneficijs deteriores fiunt. From Syria (saith he) to Rome I haue fought with beastes, beeing night and day held in bondage by ten Leopards, I meane ten Souldious, who notwithstanding many benifits I bestowed vpon them, yet do they vse me worse and worse: and thus much for the cruelty of Panthers and Leopards. We haue shewed already how they become tame, and are vsed in hunting, The nature of tamed Panthers. vnto which discourse (somewhat out of the place) I will adde a true narration of two Panthers or Leopards nourished in France for the king, whereof one was of the bignesse of a great Calfe, and the other of a great Dogge, and that on a day the lesser was brought forth for the King to behold how tame and tractable he was, and that he would ride behinde his keeper vppon a cloath or pillow being tyed in a chaine: and if a Hare had beene let loose in his presence and he turn d down to her, within a few iumpes or leapes he would attain and take her. When the keeper was to take vp the Leopard againe, he did come to him backeward, least if he should see his face, he should leape vpon him and wound him, (for as we haue said they are angry being chafed and are ready to flye into the Hunters face) therefore he turneth his face away from him, and betwixt his Legges reacheth him a peece of bread or flesh, and so he gently taketh him into his chaine and callar againe, lea∣ding him away to his house, and assoone as the man was mounted the beast also knew his seate and leaped vp after him. And the same party also related, that when as a Lyon was turned forth to a Bull, the Lyon very quietly without stirring lay downe and did no harme, or offer any violence or combate with the Bull: but afterward when as the two Leopardes were turned forth to the same Bull, they instantly ran and tooke the Bull by the throate, and without all doubt they had strangled and pulled out his throate, (had not their keepers which had long chaines tyed about their Neckes in their handes) restrained and pulled them off againe. By this may be coniectured how great is the rage of the wild and vntamed Leopards and Panthers, seeing the tame and gentle are so cruell; and therefore the Lord in the pro∣phets did most wisely compare the siedge of the Assirians abovt Ierusalem to a Leopard, watching at the gates of the Citty to destroy all that came out thereat. The taking of Panthers. Hauing thus discoursed of the nature, partes, kindnesse, loue, and hatred of these beastes in generall, it now followeth to expresse the best meanes to auoide and destroy them, that so we may not onely know our enimy but also learne the way to ouermatch and curbe him. There is a kind of Henbane which is called Pardalianches or Libbard▪bane which the inhabitants of Pharnacus, Dioscorides and the mount Ida, were wont to lay in the Mountaines for the destoying of Leopards, Pardals, and Panthers. This Hearbe is not much known at this day, yet I take it to be the same which groweth in many places of France and Sauoy, and it is called Tora, by the roote thereof beaten to powder and stopped vp in flesh, not only beastes, but also Wolues and Swine, as wilde Boares are destroyed if they tast thereof, when the beast perceiueth himselfe poysoned, presently he seeketh for mans dung, for without that he cannot bee deliuered; wherefore the Hunters do also place neere vnto it some vessell of it hanging in a tree, with the mouth or way open that leadeth into it, wher∣into the greedy beast leapeth, and being in, cannot get forth againe, but rather dyeth with hunger, Pliny. Aristotle or else is taken and killed, or else the vessell is hanged vp so high that the beast by strayning himselfe to leape into it and get his desired medicine, (but all in vaine) spen∣deth out the time of his recouery til the poyson hath throughly corrupted his body, and euery part and member, for otherwise so great is the life, spirit, and stomake of this beast, that he will fight and not yeald to his aduersary, although his guts and intrals hang about his legs out of his belly. Therefore the Panthers of Hircania do more often perish by poyson then by other vi∣olence of Swords, Speares, or Dogges: for by this poyson the beast many times falleth to such a loosenesse of his belly, and withall such a weakenesse thereby, that he is taken a∣liue. Likewise in Armenia there are certaine Fishes which are poyson to Lyons, Beares, Wolues, Lynces, and Panthers, the powder of this fish the inhabitants put into the sides and flesh of their Sheepe, Goates, and Kyds, without all harme to these beastes, but if the Panthers or any rauening beast come and deuoure any of those sheep so dressed, present∣ly they die by poison. When they are hunted and forced in the presence of the hunters, then they leape di∣rectly vnto their heades, and therefore the hunter taketh great care both of his standing and also of holding his speare, for if he receiue not the Panther in his leape and gore him to the heart, or else otherwise wound him mortally, he is gone, and his life is at an end. Op∣pianus also sheweth that he is taken as Lyons are, especially by these meanes following, for when the hunters perceiue the way or path which he vseth to his water, therein they make a deepe ditch (but not so great as they make for a Lyon) wherein they erect a wod∣den pillar or great post, vnto that they tie certaine engins, and withall a male little Dogge whose stones or tender coddes they bind with some string or cord, so as the young beast may whine and cry for paine, by which voice hee inuiteth and calleth the Panther to his destruction: For the greedy beast winding the voice of the Dogge, bestirreth himselfe to meete with his desired prey or booty; at last finding the ditch and seeing the Dogge downe, he leapeth, where the engins take present hold vpon him and destroy him, and so he describeth the same meanes to take great fishes by the sight of little Fishes swimming in a net. In hunting of wilde beasts the wary Wood-man must make good choice of his horse, Oppianus not onely for the mettell and agility which are very necessary, but also for the colour, as we haue already expressed in the story of the Horse: for the gray Horse is fittest for the Beare, and most terrible to him, the yellow or fire colour against the Bore, but the brown and reddish colour against the Panther. The Moores also vse other deuises to take Panthers and all such noysome beastes, they enclose in a house in a little house certaine rotten flesh, which by the sauour thereof when it stinketh, draweth the wilde Beasts vnto it: For they make a dore, or a gate of reedes vn∣to the said house, through which the filthy smell breaketh out and disperseth it selfe into the wide aire; presently the wilde beastes take it vp, and follow it withall speede they can, for there is not any muske or other sweete thing wherewithall men are so much deligh∣ted, as rauening beastes are with the sauour of carrion: therefore like an amorous cup it draweth them to the snare of perdition: for beside the rotten flesh, they erect many en∣gins and vnauoidable traps, to snare in the beast when he commeth to rauen. The Christians of AFFRICKE did institute a generall hunting of Leopards, inclo∣sing the ends of the waies through which the beastes were to passe: The Leopard when he was stirred ranne too and fro distracted, because in all his passages he found Horse-men ready to resist him, neither left they any way for him to escape: at length wearied with many windinges, turninges, and prouocations, the Horse-men might easily come vnto him and pearce him with their speares, but if it fortuned that the Leopard escaped, and brake away from the Hunters; then hee at whose corner he brake forth, was bound by an∣cient custome to make the residue a dinner or banquet. Among the Chaonians there was a certaine young Noble man which loued a Virgin called Anthippe, the which two louers were walking together a good season in a Wood; It happened while they were there, that Cichyrus the Kings Sonne prosecuted a Pardall in hunting, which was fled into that Wood, and seeing him, bent his arme against him and cast his Dart: the which Dart missed the marke and killed the Virgin Anthippe, the young Prince thought that hee had slaine the beast, and therefore drew neare on Horse-back to reioyce ouer the fall of the game, according to the maner of hunters; but at his approch he found it far otherwise, for in stead of the effusiō of the bloud of a beast, (that which was more lamentable) his right hand had shed the bloud of a Virgin: For when he came to them he saw her dying and drawing her last breath, and the young man held his hand in the wound to stanch the bloude: for sorrow whereof hee presently fell distracted in his mind, and ran his horse to the top of a sharp rocke, from whence he cast downe himselfe headlong and so perished. The Chaonians after they vnderstood this feareful accident, and the reason of it, com∣passed in the place where he fell with a wall, and for the honor of their dead Prince buil∣ded a Citty where he lost his life, and called it Cichyrus after his owne name. Their loue of Wine. Leopards and Panthers do also loue Wine aboue all other drinke, and for this cause both Bacchus was resembled to them, and they dedicated to him: Bacchum tauro assimu∣lant & Pardali, quod homines ebrij belluarum istarum ingenia referant, & omnia violenter a∣gant, quidam enim iracunda fiunt Taurorum instar, & pugnaces feri{que} vt Pardales : saith Plato in his second booke of lawes; they resemble and compare Bacchus to a Bull, or Pardall, because drunken men in all their actions do imitate the disposition of these wilde beasts, both in their folly and violence: For some of them are wrathfull like Bulles, and some of them wild apt to fight, like Pardals: Bac hus was also called Nebrides, because he wore the skinne of a hinde-Calfe, which is spotted almost like a Panther: and therefore a fearefull man, or a drunken, variable and in constant man, is said to weare a skinne of diuers colours: but the chiefe cause why Panthers were dedicated to Bacchus was for their loue of Wine; for all writers doe constantly and with one consent affirme, that they drinke wine vnto drunkennesse: the manner and end thereof is eligantly described by Oppianus in this sort: When the inhabitants of Lybia do obserue some little fountaine arising out of the sand, and falling downe againe, (as in the manner of small springes which can not encrease into great riuers) whereat the Panthers and Pardals vse to drinke early in a morning, before it be light. After they haue beene at their prey in the night time, the hunters come and poure twentie or thirtie pitchers of olde sweete wine into the saide fountaine, then a little way from it they lye downe and couer them selues with cloathes, or with straw, for their is no shelter either of tree or bushes in that Countrey. In the morning the Panthers ardently thirsting, and being almost dead for want of drinke, come vnto the same fountaine, and tasting of the wine drinke thereof great aboun∣dance, which presently falleth to worke vpon their braines, for they begin first of all to leape and sport themselues, vntill they be well wearied, and then they lye downe and sleepe most soundly, at which time the hunters that lye in waite for them, come and take them without all feare or perill: Thus farre Oppianus. Vse of their parts. Concerning the vse of their seuerall partes I finde little among the auncientes, except of their skinnes, for the foote-men and auncient souldiers of the Moores, did not onely weare them for garments, but also sleept vpon them in the night time. The shepheards of Ethiopia called Agriophagi doe eate the flesh of Lyons and Panthers, al∣though it be hot and dry. The medicines of the Panther, or Leopard. Auicenna If the skinne or hide of a Leopard being taken and flead be couered or laid vppon the ground, there is such force and vertue in the same that any venemous or poison some ser∣pentes dare not approch into the same place where it is so laid. The flesh of a Panther being roasted or boiled at the fire, and smelled by any one which is troubled with the pal∣sie, Albertus or shaking in the ioyntes, as also by them which are troubled with the bearing and continuall mouing or turning of the heart, is a very profitable and excellent remedy for the same. The same fat or sewet of a Leopard being mixed or mingled with the Oyle which pro∣ceedeth from the Bay-tree, and then mollified both together, and so annointed vpon any one which is troubled with the scurfe or Mangy, the scabs whereof doth cut or pierce the skinne, Rasis doth presently and without any griefe or paine cure the same. The twigges of a Vine-tree being dryed and beaten into small dust or powder, and mingled together with the fat or grease of a Leopard, and so annointed vppon the face of any one who is grieued with akings and swellinges thereon, will not onely cure and heale the same without any paine or sorrow, Arcteus Galen but also preserue the same free from blemishes in the time of healing. The grease also of a Leopard by it selfe, being annointed vpon the head of any one who doth shead or cast his haire or is troubled with the Foxes euill, doth immediately helpe and cure the same. The blood of a Panther being annointed vpon the vaines or sinnewes of either man or woman who is grieued with any swelling or akings therein, is very profi∣table and curable to expell the same away. The braines of a Leopard being mingled with a little quantity of the water which is called a Canker, and with a little Iasmine, and so mix∣ed together and then drunke, doth mittigate the paine or ach of the belly. The braines of the same beast being mixed with the iuyce of a canker & annointed vpon the genital of a∣ny man, doth incitate and stir him vp to lechery, but the marrow which commeth from this beast being drunke in wine doth ease the paine or wringing of the guts and the belly. The gall of a Panther being receiued into the body either in meate or drinke, doth instant∣ly and out of hand kill or poyson him which doth so receiue it. The right stone of a Leo∣pard being taken of a woman of a farre spent age, doth restore vnto her, her menstruall purgation being ceased, and doth make her to purge, if she doe hartely receiue hir meate more often. OF THE POEPHAGVS. T Here is a beast in India called Poephagus, because he fee∣deth vpon hearbes and grasse like a Horse, whose quantity he doth exceede double, for he is twice so big, his taile is most thicke and blacke, the haires whereof are thinner then the haires of a mans head: and therefore the Indian women make great account of them, for with them they binde vp their own haire, platting it, and folding it in cu∣rious manner, euery haire is two cubites in length, and vpon one roote twenty or thirty of them grow togither: this great beast is one of the fearefullest creatures in the World; for if he perceiue himselfe to be but looked at of any body he taketh him to his heeles as fast as he can goe, and yet although his heart bee light his heeles be heauy, for saith my Author, Magis studiose quam celeriter fugam peragit. That is, He hath a good will to run apace, but cannot performe it: but if he be followed vpon good swift Horsses, or with nimble Dogges, so as he perceiueth they are neare to take him, and he by no meanes can auoyde them, then doth hee turne himselfe, hiding his taile, and looketh vppon the face of the hunter with some confidence, gathering his wits together, (yet in fearefull manner, as it were to face out his pursuer or hunter, that he had no taile, and that the residue of his body were not worth looking after: but while he standeth staring on his hunter, another commeth behinde him and killeth him with a speare, so they take off the skinne and the taile, and throw away the flesh as vnprofitable, Aelianus. for the other recompence their labour for their paines. Volateranus relateth this a little otherwise, and saith that the beast biteth off his owne taile, and so deliuereth himselfe from the hunter, knowing that he is not desired for any other cause. Nicolaus Venetus an Earle, writing of the furthest part or prouince of Asia, Aene. Silui. which hee calleth Macinum, and I thinke he meaneth Serica, because hee saith it lyeth betwixt the Mountaines of India and Cathay, there are a generation of white and blacke Oxen which haue Horsses tailes, but reaching downe to their heeles, and much rougher. The haires whereof are as thinne as the feathers of flying Birds, these he saith are in great estimation, for the Knights and Horse-men of that Countrey doe weare them vpon the top of their lances and speares for a badge or cognisance of honor, the which I thought fitte to bee remembred in this place, because I take them to bee either the same with these Indian beasts, or very like vnto them. The Porcuspine or Porcupine. I Can not learne any name for this beast among the Hebrewes, and therefore by probabilitie it was vnknowne to them: The Graecians call it Acanthocoiros and Hystrix, The seuerall names. Bellonius. that is, sus setosa, a hairy, or bristly, or thorny hogge, for their quils which they beare vpon their backe, are called both Pili, setae, villi, pinnae, aculei, and spinae, that is, both haires, bristles, rough-haire, pins, prickles, and thornes. The Arabians call it Aduldull, and Adualbul, adubul, adulbus, and some Aherha which by A∣uicen and his Glossographer, is defined to bee Montanus Ericius habeus spinas sagittales, Bellonius an Hedghogge of the Mountaine, hauing qvils or thornes vppon his back which he shooteth off at his pleasure. The Graecians at this day call it Scan cha∣ros which is deriued or rather corrupted of Acanthocoiros. The Italians call him Porco-spi∣noso and Histrice or Istrice, without an Aspiration, the Spaniardes Puerco-espin, the French Porc espic, the Illirians Porcospino, the Illirians Morskaszwijnija, imitating therein the Germans which call a Sea-Hogge Ein Meerschwyn : The Germaines in some places call it Taran, and in other places Dornschweyn, that is a Thorny-hogge, by a fained name in imi∣tation of other Nations, and also Porcopick following the Italians, Spaniardes, French, English, and Illirians: I will not stand to confute them, who write that this beast is a Sea-beast, and not a beast of the land, nor yet those that make question whether it be a kind of Hedghog or not, for without all controuersie as the Arabians, Pliny, Albertus, Bellunensis, and other doe affirme, the vulgar Hedghog is Ericius Syluestris, and the Porcupine Erici∣us Montanus. These are bred in INDIA and AFFRICKE, and brought vp and downe in Europe to be seene for mony: Likewise about the Citty Cassem in TARTARIA, by the sight of one of these it appeared that it was three foot long, the mouth not vnlike to a Hares, but with a longer slit or opening: so also the head of the same similitude: the eares like to the eares of a man: The forefeete were like the feete of a Badger, and the hinderfeete like the feete of a Beare, it hath a mane standing vp in the vpper part right or direct, but hollow or bending before: Vpon the bunches of his lips on either side of his mouth, their groweth forth long blacke bristles. The quils & speares. The generall proportion of his body is like a Swines, and they neuer exceede the stature of a Swine of halfe a yeare old. The foure for most teeth hang ouer his lips, and that which is most admirable in him, the quils or thornes growing vpon his backe in stead of haire, he vseth for hands, armes, and weapons. They first grow out of his backe and sides, which are of two colours, that is partly black and partly white, which whensoeuer he pleaseth, he mooueth to and fro like as a Peacocke doth his taile: they grow in length two, three, or foure hands breadths, they stand not in any confused order of colours, but in well formed and distinguished rankes, being sharp at the points like a knife: When they are hunted the beast stretcheth his skin, and casteth thē off, one or two at a time, according to necessity vpon the mouths of the Dogs, or Legs of the Hunters that follow her, with such violence that many times they stick into trees & woods wherfore Solinus writeth thus, and also Paulus Venetus: Cum capiuntur, spinis suis sape homines, & canes ledunt: nam canes in eos prouocati adeo irritant fer as illas vt simul concur∣rentes terga sua, quibus spinae innituntur vehe enter commoueant, at{que} inuiciniores homines, & canes vibrent. That is to say, When they are taken they many times hurt both Dogs and men, for when the Dogges being prouoked by them, runne vpon the backes which beare the quils, they are so far stirred, that they cast them off vpon al that stand near them, and therefore they sight flying. The Hunters to saue their Dogges doe deuise engins and traps wherein to take them: beside the quils that grow vpon their backes, they haue also some vppon their heades and Neckes, which they never cast off, but keepe them on as a Horsse doth his mane. The pilgrimes that come yearly from Saint Ieames of Compostella in Spaine, doe bring backe generally one of these quils in their caps, The den and foode. but for what cause I know not. The pace of this beast is very slow and troublesome vnto it, and therefore it is hardly drawne out of his den, which it diggeth like a Badger, from which it neuer goeth farre, but feedeth vpon those thinges which are neare vnto it: It is a filthy beast, smelling ranke because it liueth so much in the earth, being wilde it neuer drinketh, and I thinke it eateth Apples, roots, and rindes of trees, and peraduenture snailes, and such reptile creatures, but being ta∣med, it eateth all kinde of fruite, likewise bread, pycrust, and such thinges broken small. It drinketh also water, but aboue all other wine mingled with water: In the day time it sleepeth and in the night time it waketh, by which we gather, that being wilde it feareth the light, and therefore trauelleth in the night time for his meat and liuing. It is a gene∣rall liue creature, and begetteth other in his owne kinde: the female bearing the yoong ones in her belly, as long time as a Beare, that is thirtie daies; and also it hideth it selfe foure monethes in the Winter time like a Beare, but whether for cold or any other cause the Authors doe not expresse. In my opinion for cold rather then for any other reason, although there be some that affirme it lyeth hid in the Summer time, and commeth abroad in the Winter time, contrary to the course of all other beasts, and therefore such a paradox doth want the testimony of some credible writers, which should affirme it vpon their owne experience, or else it were requisite to bring sufficient reasons to lead their Readers to beleeue it, but neither of both is discharged by them and therefore it is safer for vs to follow Aristotle and Pliny, who hold the first opinion, then Albertus and Agricola who encline to the later. In all other things both of their lying hid, of their procreation, of the comming out of their caue and nourishing their yoong ones, they imitate the manners and conditions of Beares. Concerning the vse of their parts I find none but onely of their quils, for with them it is said if men scrape their teeth they will neuer be loose, likewise women were wont in auncient time to vse them for parting asunder their haire in the toppe of their crownes. The vse of the flesh and other parts. The flesh of this beast is like a hedg-hogs, neither very naturall for meate and nourish∣ment, nor yet very medicinable: yet it is said to helpe a weake and ouerburthened sto∣macke, to procure loosenesse of the belly, and to diminish all leprosies and scabbed ex∣ulcerations and pustles: Being salted it is good against the dropsie, and also very profitable as Platina writeth to be eaten by them, that cannot containe vrine in their beds: yet the Graecians attribute no such qualitie vnto this, but to helpe the stomacke and loosen the belly they attribute to the sea-hogge, and against the leprosie scabs, and incontinencie of vrine to the hedg-hog, but peraduenture the saying of Pliny (Quae de Herniaceis dicuntur omnia tanto magis valebunt in Histrice) leadeth them to attribute these things to the Porcuspine. The powder of their quils burnt, drunk or eaten in meats or broth do promote and helpe conception: Thus saith Aui∣cen, and herewithall I conclude this short dis∣course of the Hedg-hogge. Of the Raeyner, or Rainger. T His beast is called by the Latines Rangifer, by the Germains Rein, Reiner, Raineger, Reinssthier, by the French Raingier, and Ranglier, and the later Latins call it Reingus. It is a beast altogither vnknowne to the auncient Graecians and Latins, Of the seue∣rall names. except the Machlis that Pliny speaketh of be it: but we haue shewd already in the story of the Elk, that Alces and Machlis are all one. This beast was first of all discouered by Olaus Magnus in this Northerne part of the world, towardes the poale Artique, as in Norwa , Swetia, and Scandinauia, at the first sight whereof he called it Raingifer, quasi Ramifer because he beareth hornes on his head like the boughes of a tree. The similitude of this beast is much like to a Hart, but it is much bigger, stronger, and swifter. It beareth 3. orders or rowes of hornes on the head, as by the direction of Valentinus Grauius, and Benedictus Martinus are heere expressed. This beast chaungeth his colour, according to the time of the yeare, and also acording to the quality of the place wherein he feedeth, which appeareth by this, because some of them are found to be of the colour of Asses, and shortly after to be like Hartes. Their breast is ful of long bristles, The colour and seuerall parts. being rough and riged through the same. The legges hairy, and the hooves hollow, clouen, and moouable, which in his course he spreadeth abroade vppon the deepest snowes, without pressing his footsteppes farre into them: and by his admirable celerity he auoideth all the wilde beasts which in the vallies lie in waight to de∣stroy him. He beareth very high and lofty horns, which presently from the root branch forth into two stems or pikes, I meane both the hornes seuerally into two, which again at the top disperce themselues into pikes like the fingers of ones hand; In the middle of the hornes there is a little branch standeth out like a knobbe, or as a huckle in the hinder part of a beasts legge, from thence againe they ascend vpwards a great heighth, and doe grow broad at the toppe, where they are diuided like the palme of a hand. The hornes are white, distinguished with long apparant vaines, differing both from the hornes of Elks, and the horns of Harts, from Elks in heighth, and from Harts in bredth and from them both in colour and multitude of braunches: When he runneth he layeth them on his backe, for when he stands stil, the lowest braunches comming foorth of the roots of the hornes, do almost couer his face with these lower braunches. In the winter time when he is a thirst, and commeth to the frozen waters he breaketh the yce: The vse of their lowest horns. being wilde he liueth vpon such fruits as he findeth in the woods, especially the gum that commeth out of the Trees, and also the mosse that groweth vpon them, making himselfe shaddowed dens and resting places in the mountaines: but in the deepest colde weather he commeth into the Mountaines of Norway, towards Mosiberg, and other hils. He is taken by the Countrey-people for priuate vses, for hee is profitable after he is ta∣med, both for the plow and trauailes in iournies. The people called Lappi or Lappones, do vse them instead of horses and Oxen, for they haue a kind of Cart made in forme and fa∣shion of a fishers boat, whereunto they ioyne these beasts to draw them, and the Carter hath a conuenient seat fitted for him on the forepart thereof, wherein he sitteth with his legs fast tyed to the cart, to the intent he be not cast off when the beast runs speedily: he carrieth the raines whereby he gouerneth them in his left hand, and in his right hande a staffe, wherewithall he sustaineth the cart when it is in daunger of falling, and in this course they wil continue indefatigable twenty Germain miles a day, which is more then threescore English miles. At night when the beasts are vnyoaked, of their owne accord, without guide or leader they wil go to their feeding places, or ac∣customed stables. It is a very sociable creature, for they do liue togither in heardes aboue a thousand in a flock, wherunto it may be the Lord aluded in the 50. Psalme, when hee saide by the mouth of Asaph, All the beasts of the fielde are mine, and the flockes of thousands which run wilde on the hilles. The females want hornes, and theyr milke is the greatest part of foode to those Northerne people: they haue bin seene at Auspurge in Germany sadled and bridled, for in their trauailes they need not haue any prouender carried with them, for if ye turne them out in the midst of the winter, they find certaine rootes and mosse vnder the snowe whereof they eat, and content themselues. Their best food is grasse. They are vsed both in Muscouia, Polonia, Bohemia, Scandinauia, and Massouia, yet they can endure no heate, for being brought into Bohemia they dy. Their cartes which they draw must be made with a sharp edge at the bottome like a boat or ship as we haue said already, for they are not drawne vpon wheeles, but like draies and sleads vpon the earth. There was a Laponian which brought one of these into Ger∣many in December, and he professeth he neuer felt so much heat of the Sun in al his life as hee did at that time, which is our coldest time in the yeare, and therefore how great is the cold which both men and beasts endure in that country. The hornes of these beastes are to be seene both in BERNE and at AVSPVRGE in GERMANY; the feet are somewhat white, being rounder then a Harts feete, and more clouen or deuided, wherefore at sometimes one part of his hoofe may be seene vppon a stone, while the other part resteth vpon the earth, and in the vper part of the hoof where it beginneth to be clouen neare the legge, there is a certaine thicke skin or membraine, by vertue whereof the foote may be stretched in the diuision without harme or paine to the beast. The king of SVVETIA had ten of them nourished at LAPPA, which he caused euery day to be driuen vnto the mountaines into the colde ayre, for they were not able to en∣dure the heat. The mouth of this beast is like the mouth of a cow, they many times come out of Laponia into Swetia, where they are wonderfuly anoied with wolus, but they gather themselues togither in a ring, and so fight against their enimies with their hornes. They are also in their owne naturall countrey annoyed with Gulons, and generally all beastes that liue vppon the spoile of flesh, are enemies vnto them, and desire to destroy and eate them. In their pace, both slow and speedie, the Articles of their legs make a noise like the craking of Nuts. Their was one of these beasts giuen vnto the Duke of Saxony in the year of our Lord 1561. In Scandiuania they vse them for the carriadge of mettels, drawing of Chariots and riding, and the nerues of them when they are dead make bows, and for want of nailes, they do fasten plankes and boords togither. OF THE RHINOCEROS. W E are now to discourse of the second wonder in nature, namely of a beast euery way admirable, both for the outward shape, quantity, and greatnesse, A praeface to the succee∣ding story. and also for the inward courage, disposition, and mildnes. For as the Elephant was the first wonder, of whom we haue already dis∣coursed, so this beast next vnto the Elephant filleth vp the number, be∣ing euery way as admirable as he, if he doe not exceede him, except in quantity of height of stature; And being now come to the story of this beast, I am hartily sorry, that so strange an outside, as by the figure you may perceiue, yealding no doubt through the omnipotent power of the creator, an answerable inside, and infinite testimo∣nies of worthy and memorable vertues comprized in it, should through the ignorance of men, lye vnfoulded and obscured before the Readers eyes: for he that shall but see our stories of the Apes, of the Dogs, of the Mice, & of other small beasts, and consider how larg a treatise we haue collected together out of many writers, for the illustration of their natures and vulgar conditions, he cannot chuse but expect some rare and strange mat∣ters, as much vnknowne to his minde about the storie of this Rhinoceros, as the outward shape and picture of him, appeareth rare and admirable to his eies: differing in euery part from all other beasts, from the top of his nose to the tip of his taile, the eares and eies excepted, which are like Beares. But gentle Reader as thou art a man, so thou must consi∣der since Adam went out of Paradice, ther was neuer any that was able perfectly to describe the vniuersall conditions of all sorts of beasts, and it hath bin the counsell of the almighty himselfe, for the instruction of man, concerning his fall and naturall weakenesse, to keep him from the knowledge of many deuine things, and also humane, which is of birds and beasts, Fishes and foule, that so he might learne, the difference betwixt his generation, & his degeneration, and consider how great a losse vnto him was his fall in Paradice; who be∣fore that time knew both God himselfe and al creatures, but since that time neither know∣eth God as he should know him, nor himselfe as he shall know it, nor the creatures as hee did know then. But for my part which write the English story, I acknowledge that no man must looke for that at my hands, which I haue not receiued from some other: for I would bee vnwil∣ling to write any thing vntrue, or vncertaine out of mine owne inuention; and truth on euery part is so deare vnto mee, that I will not lie to bring any man in loue and admiration with God and his works, for God needeth not the lies of men: To conclude therfore this Praeface, as the beast is strange and neuer seene in our countrey, so my eye-sight cannot adde any thing to the description: therefore harken vnto that which I haue obserued out of other writers. That there is such a beast as the Rhino¦ceros. First of all that there is such a beast in the world, both Pliny, Solinus, Diodorus, Aelia∣nus, Lampridius, and others, doe yeald erefrigable testimony. Heliogabalus had one of them at Rome. Pompey the great, in his publike spectacles did likewise produce a Rhino∣cerot (as Seneca writeth) When Augustus rode triumphing for Cleopatra, he brought forth to the people a sea-horse and a Rhinocerot which was the first time that euer a Rhinocerot was seene at Rome (as Coelius writeth.) Antoninus Pius the Emperor, did giue many gifts vnto the people, amongst which were both Tigers and Rhinocerots, (saith Iulius Capitali∣nus in his life.) Martiall also celebrateth an excellent epigram of a Rhinocerot, which in the presence of Caesar Domitian did cast vp a Bull into the aire vvith his horne, as if he had bin a tenyce ball, the epigram is this: O quam terribilis exarsit pronus in tram, Quantus erat cornu, cui pila Taurus erat. Lastly to put it out of all question that there is such a beast as this Rhinocerot, the picture & figure here expressed, was taken by Gesner from the beast aliue at Lysbon in Portugale, before many witnesses, both Marchants and others; so that we haue the Testimony both of antiquity and of the present age, for the Testimony of the forme and fashion of this beast, and that it is not the inuention of man, but a worke of God in nature, first created in the beginning of the World, and euer since continued to this present day. Concerning the name of this beast, the Graecians because of the horne in his Nose call him Rhinoceros, that is a Nose-horned-beast, and the Latins also haue not altered that inuention, . for although there be many beastes that haue but one horne, yet is there none that haue that one horne growing out at their Nose but this alone: All the residue haue the horne growing out at their foreheads. There be some that haue taken this Rhinoce∣ros, for the Monoceros the Vnicorne, because of this one horne, but they are deceiued, ta∣king the generall for the speciall which is a note of ignorance in them, and occasion of rr ur vnto others; yet it is better to take the Rhinoceros for the Monoceros, because there is nothing in the speciall which is not contained in the generall, according to the maxime of Logicke: Nihil est qui specie, quod non prius fuit in genere : And yet that is also absurd, considering that Monoceros is not onely a word of generality for all one-horned-beastes, but of particularity a name for the Vnicorne, whereby is ment the Indian -Asse, as we shall shew in the story of the Vnicorne. This beast in the Haebrew is thought to be called Reem, or and Karas, and there∣fore Munster so translateth it. Deutro. 33. Tauri decor eius, cornua Rhinocerotis, cornua e∣ius in eis ventilabit nationes ad summum vs{que} terrae. His beauty is like the beauty of a Bull, and his hornes like the hornes of a Rhinocerot, with the which he shall winnow the nations to the tops of the hils. And Tertullian writing against the heretique Praxeas, doth so translate it. If a man compare together the Greeke word Rhinoceros, and Reem, and Karas, or Rimna and Karas, hee will easily thinke that either the Graecians haue ioyned together the two Haebrew wordes, as Rhinoceros quasi Reem Karas, or Rimna Karas, or else the Haebrewes haue par∣ted asunder the Greeke word, for Reem and Rimna may very well come of Rhino, and Ka∣ras of Keros, yet heerein I leaue the Readers to their owne iudgment. The Indians cal this beast in their tongue, Oppianus. The quanti∣ty and seue∣rall parts. Scandabenamet, as Festus writeth, but wee will leaue the name and come to the description of it. In quantity it is not much bigger then an Orix: Pliny maketh it equall in length to an Elephant, and some make it longer then an Elephant, but withall they say it is lower, and hath shorter Legges. Strabo in his 16. booke speaking of the Ethiopian Region, neare India, calleth these Rhinocerots Aethiopian Buls, and saith that they are bred onely in that Country, and by the relation of Artemidorus he writeth thus: Outoi de micron apoleypont ton elephantoon oi rinokerotes, osper Artemidoros phesi, epi seirau, to mekei, kai per eorakenai phesas an Alexandria, alla schedon ti osoon to vpsei apogetou aph'emoon oruthentos, &c. That is to say, The Rhinocerotes are exceeded by the Elephantes in length, but in hight they al∣most equall them, (as Artemidorus said) he saw by one that was at Alexandria, and the co∣lour thereof was not like a Box-tree, but rather like an Elephantes, his quantity▪ greater then a Buls, or as the greatest Bvll, but his outward forme and proportion like a wilde Boares, especiallye in his mouth, except that out of his Nose groweth a horne, har∣der then any bones, which he vseth in stead of armes, euen as a Boare doth his teeth; hee hath also two girdles vpon his body like the wings of a Dragon, comming from his backe downe to his belly, one toward his necke or mane, and the other toward his loines and hinder parts. Thus far Strabo. Whereunto we may adde the description of other parts out of Oppianus, Pliny, and So∣linus. His colour like rinde or barke of a boxe-tree, (which doth not differ much from and Elephant) and on his forehead there grow haires which seeme a little red, and his back i distinguished with certaine purple spots vpon a yellow ground. The skinne is so firme and hard, that no Dart is able to pierce it, and vppon it appeare many deuisions, like the shelles of a Tortaeise set ouer with skales, hauing no haire vppon the backe. In like man∣ner, the Legs are scaled downe to the hooues which are parted into foure distinct clawes, vpon his nose their groweth a hard and sharp horne, crooking a little towards the crowne of his head, but not so high: flat and not round, so sharp and strong, Vt quicquid impetie∣ret, aut ve ilet, aut perforet, & ferrum etiam & saxa transigat: saith Oppianus & Aelianus▪ that is, whatsoeuer it is set to, either it casteth it vp into the aire, or else boreth it through though it be Iron or stones. Eucherius saith that the Rhinorerot hath two hornes in his nose, but that is vtterly false, as you may see by the picture: Although Martiall seeme to expresse so much in these ver∣ses; Nam{que} grauem cornu gemino sic extulit vrsum Iactat vt impositas Taurus in astra pilas. The Rhinocerot cast vp a Beare into the aire, euen as a Bull would do a ball which were layd vpon his two hornes: we shall not neede to apply Gemino cornu to the Bull, as Politianus doth, but rather take it figuratiuely for a strong horne, and if it must needs be litterall, it is apparant by the picture that there is another little horne, not vpon the nose, but vppon the wither of the beast, I meane the top of his shoulder next to his ecke, so that the error of Eucherius lyeth not in the number, but in the place, and that it may appeare that this horne is not a fained thing, Pausanius aboue two thousand yeare ago writeth thus; Rhino∣ceroti in summo naso cornu singulare est, & aliud supra ipsum non magnum in capite nullum. I do maruaile how it came to passe that men which can mocke and deride others cunning∣ly should be called prouerbially Nasuti homines, except the prouerbe were taken from the Rhinoceros, who by reason of his crooked horne is said to haue a crooked nose; for indeede a deformed nose is more subiect to derision then any other part or member of the body, which caused Martiall to write thus: Maiores nunquam rhonchi iuvenes{que} senes{que}, Et pueri nasum Rhinocerotis habent. And thereupon Horace also saith thus: Naso suspendis adunco. Oppianus saith, that there was neuer yet any destinction of sexes in these Rhinocerotes : for all that euer were found were males and not females, but from hence let no body gather that there are no females, for it were impossible that the breede should continue without females, and therfore Plinius and Solinus say, that they engender or admit copulation like Elephants, Camels, and Lyons. When they are to fight they whet their horne vpon a stone, and there is not only a dis∣cord betwixt these beasts and Elephants for their food, but a naturall description and en∣mity: for it is confidently affirmed, that when the Rhinocerot which was at Lisborne, was brought into the presence of an Elephant, the Elephant ran away from him. How and in what place he ouercommeth the Elephant we haue shewed already in his story, name∣ly, how he fastneth his horne in the soft part of the Elephantes belly. Hee is taken by the same meanes that the Vnicorne is taken, for it is said by Albertus, Isidorus, and Alunnus, that aboue all other creatures they loue Virgins, and that vnto them they will come be they neuer so wilde, and fall a sleepe before them, so being asleepe they are easily taken and carried away. All the later Physitians do attribute the vertue of the Vnicorns horne to the Rhinocerots horn, but they are deceiued by imitation of Isidorus and Albertus : for there is none of the auncient Graecians that haue euer obserued any medicines in the Rhinocerot. The Indians make bottels of their skins, wherein they put their Lycion, or succum medicatum, and there∣fore I wil conclude this story, with the riddle of Fraunciscus niger made vpon the excellen∣cy of the horne that groweth vpon the nose. Dic mihi quae superis sint acceptissima dona, Whereunto the answer is made in the next verse: Principium nasi Rhinocerotis amant. OF THE SHEEPE. T He Haebrewes haue diuers names, whereby they signifie a sheep, & al that kind, as Zon, and Zoneth, for which the Sep∣tuagints do alwaies render Probata, The seueral names. sheep or little cattle. The Arabians Genas. The Chaldeans Ana. The Persians Gospand, also Rachel in Haebrew: the plurall whereof is Rechelim which signifieth sheepe: Kebesch, and Kabsa, or Kibsa, Esay 53. Tahel, Neelamah, that is a dombe sheep, where the Hebrewes haue Rachel, there the Chaldes tran∣slate Rachlak. The Arabians Akalak. The Persians Chomes∣chan thu. Kebes and Kibsa signifie a Sheepe, male and fe∣male vnder a year old, and Aijl, and Eel for a sheep aboue a year old male & female. In Leuit. 22. the Chalde translateth for Kebij, Imar. The Arabians Egel : The Persians Bara, and Keseb in Haebrew is the same that Kebesch. Seh also signifieth a sheep, although it be sometime taken for a Lamb or Kid. Likewise Thalch and Theleh Esa. 40. signifieth a Lambe that sucketh. And Epiphanius writeth, that by the same word the Haebrew Astronomers signified the signe Aries in the Zodiacke. The Sarazens at this day call a sheep Ganeme, and cattle Garien, and the dung of cattle Hara Garien. The Graecians call a sheepe Oijs, and Probaton, the Latins Ouis, and by excellency Pecus, the Italians Pe∣cora, the French Brebis, the Spaniards Oueia, the Germans Schaff, the Illirians Owcze, or Skop. These and such like I might adde more concerning the names of this beast, and the aboundance of the names thereof in the Haebrew tongue, is a notable testimony of the singular account which God himselfe made of this beast. The Latins haue so honored it that after it they haue named many of their children, & stories make mention of most no∣ble and gallant men, so called. Such was Ouinius Camillus, Seuerus Ouinius, Fabius Max∣imus Ouiculus, Oilycus, Oileus Aiax, Oie, the wife of Charhippus, and many such other, if it were necessary to this story to relate them, but I will not trouble the Reader with any such vnnecessary circumstances. I wil therfore first of al begin with a relation of the sheep of other countries, The descrip∣tion of diuers kids of sheep according to their country Strabo. & so in the end make a more particular discouery of our own at home. For the difference of regions do very much enlighten the discription or history of sheep. It is reported that about Erythrea, one of the Islands of the Gades, there is such aboundance of good pasture and hearbs so grateful to sheep, that if they be not let blood once in thir∣ty daies, they perish by suffocation, and that the milke of those sheep yeeldeth no whay, wherewithall they make aboundance of cheese, although they poure water into it. The herbage of that Island is dry, & yet profitable to catle and milch beasts, and from thence came the originall of the fat cattle of Geryon. The sheepe of Graecia are lesser then the sheep of Egypt, and the Oues Pirrhicae, were like Boues Pirrhicae, namely, of exceeding stature, which name was deryued from Pyrrhus their maister and owner. Among the Psil∣lians in India, their Rams are no greater then our Lambs, and Aechylides in his books of husbandry affirmeth, that the sheepe of the Isle Chius, are very small, and yet their Milke maketh very lawdable cheese. In Spain their best sheep haue black fleeces: at Polentia near the Alpes they are gray or hony-wolled in Asia and Boetica, called Erythrea, they are red like Foxes, and from thence came the tearme of Erythreae Oues. At Canusium the sheepe are yellow, or Lion tauny, and so also at Tarentum. Istria and Liburnia, yeald sheep ha∣uing wooll which is so course and rough, that it may rather seeme to be haire then wooll, and therefore neuer fit for fine garmentes, nor for any other vse, except by the singular art of spinning in Portugal. And the like to this is the wooll of the sheep of Piscenae, and in Egypt, of which latter it is said, that if it be dyed againe after it is thred-bare, it will endure almost for euer. For the ancientes (as Homer writeth) had the vse heereof (although the thread were rough) in their workes of Tapistry, and this was dressed diuers waies, for the French in Europe dresse it one way, and the Parthians in Asia another way. The sheep of Apulia gaue the name to Lana Italica, for excellent wooll, and yet was it short and course, good for nothing but for clokes to ride in, and weare in rainy weather vnto these I may adde the Calabrian, Milesian, and Arentinean sheepe, yet in the dayes of Varro they couered their sheepe with other skins to keepe the Wooll both from losse, and other infection, so that it might be the better washed, dyed, and prepared, for these were nourished most of all in houses. The French Sheep about Altinas, and also those that are scabbed or folded in the plain and barren fields of Parma & Mutina. The sheep of Heluetia feed in the tops of the Moun∣taines, whiles the Goates keepe beneath among the trees and gather fruits on the sides of the hils. The Flemmish sheep haue a soft and curled haire. There be in generall two kinds of Sheep, one called Tectum, the other Colonicum, as if you would say house-sheep, and field-sheep, for the Graecian sheep which before we haue called Tarentinae, and were also called Terintinae, because of their soft wool liued in houses, and they were also called Pellitae, but the field-sheepe hauing by nature a greater, courser, and rougher haire, are suffered to lodge abroad in the fieldes. Likewise the sheepe of Myletum and Attica, and the region Gadilonea, reaching to Ar∣menia, haue very soft and gentle wooll, which thing sildome commeth to passe in Pontus or Capadocia. In Scotland also in a place thereof, called by Hector Boethius Buthuguhania are great store of sheepe, bearing good wooll, from whence almost all that country fetch their breed. The Sheepe of Ethiopia beare no wooll at all, but in stead thereof their haire is rough like Camels haire. Amongest the Abidene, and the Beudiani, both Aelianus and Nicomachus the Sonne of Aristotle do testifie, that all their sheepe are blacke, and that there was neuer white sheepe bred in those Countries. In Gortynis their Sheepe are red and haue foure hornes: In the fortunate Islands of the red-sea all their Sheepe are white, and none of them haue crooked hornes. In Beotia there are foure Riuers which worke strange effects vpon Sheepe after they drinke of them; namely, Melas, Cephisus, Penius, and Xanthus. The Sheep drinking of Melas and Penius grow black, of Cephisus white, and yet Pliny saith, that this Riuer commeth forth from the same fountaine that Melas doth. They which drinke of Xanthus grow red: I might adde hereunto another speciall obseruation of difference betwixt the Sheepe of Pontus and Naxus, for in Pontus they haue no gaule, and in Naxus they haue two gaules. In some parts of India their Sheepe and Goates are as big as Asses, and bring forth 4. Lambes at a time, but neuer lesse then three both Sheepe and Goates. The length of their tailes reacheth downe to their hinder Legs, and therefore the shepheardes cut them off by the secrets, to the intent that they may better suffer copulation, and out of them being so cut off, they expresse certaine oile; also they cut asunder the tailes of the Rams, the ends whereof do afterwards close so nearely and naturally together, that there appea∣reth not any scar or note of the section. In Syria and India, the tailes of their Sheepe are a cubit broad. There are two kinde of sheepe in Arabia, which are distinguished by the length and breadth of their tailes: the one sort haue tailes three cubits long, by reason whereof they are not suffered to draw them on the ground for feare of wounding; and therefore the shephards deuise certaine engins of wood to support them: the other kind of sheep haue tailes like the Syrian sheepe. Al sheepe that liue in hot and dry regions haue larger tailes, and harsher wooll, but those that liue in the moyst regions and fault places, haue softer wooll and shorter tailes. There were two of the Arabian Sheepe brought into England a∣bout the yeare 1560. whose pictures were taken by Docter Cay, and therefore I haue ex∣pressed them in the page following with their description. The Arabian sheepe with a broad taile. The Arabian sheepe with a long taile. The descrip∣tion of the Arabian sheepe. T His Arabian sheep (said he) is a little bigger then our vulgar sheepe in En∣land, but of the same wooll, figure of body, and colour, onely the shins, & forepart of their face, are a litle red: the broad tail in the top was one cu∣bit, but lower it was narrower, and like the end of a vulgar sheepes tayle. They being brought on ship-board into England, were taught thorough famine and hunger, to eat not onely grasse and hay, but flesh, fish, bread, cheese, and but∣ter. Heroditus saith, that such kind of sheepe are no where found but in Arabia : the longe-tailed sheepe he calleth Macrokercos, and the broad tailed sheepe Plateukercos : yet Leo A∣fer saith, that these are of the Affrican sheepe, for thus he writeth: His arietibus nullū ab alijs discrimien est, praeter quam in cauda quā latissimā circū ferunt quae cui{que} quo opinior est, crassior obtigit, ad eo vt nonnullis libras decem, aut vigintipendat, cū sua sponte impinguantur. There is no difference betwixt these Rams and other except in their broad tail, which euermore as it growes in fatnes groweth in bredth, for if they fat of their owne accord, it hath bin found that the taile of one of these sheepe haue weighed ten or twenty pound, and not onely there, but also in Egypt, where they cram and feede theyr sheepe with Barly, Corne, and Bran: by which meanes they growe so fatte, that they are notable to stirre themselues, so that their keepers are forced to deuise little engines like childrens cares, whereupon they lay their tailes when they remoue their beasts: and the same Leo Afer affirmeth, that he saw in Egypt in a towne called Asiota, standing vpon Ni∣lus, a hundred and fifty mile from Alcair, a taile of one of these sheepe that weyghed four∣score pound, and whilst he wondred at it, scarcely beleeuing that which his eies saw, there were some present; that affirmed it to be an ordinary thing, for they said according as he writeth; Se vidisse quae semi ducentes libras expendissent: That is, they had seene some of them waigh a hundred pounds, and except in the kingdome of Tunis in Africk, and Egypt, there are none such to be found in all the world, and by it, it appeareth, that all the fatte of their bodies goeth into their tailes▪ Among the Garamants their sheepe eate flesh and milke, and it is not to be forgotten which Aristotle, Dionisius, Afer, and Varro doe write, namely that all sheepe were once wild, and that the tame sheepe which now we haue, are deriued from those wild sheepe, as our tame goats, from wild goats; and therefore Varro saith, Flockes of wilde sheepe that in his daies in Phrigia there were flockes of wild sheepe, whereof as out of Africk & the Region of the Gadits, there were annually brought to Rome both males and females, of strange and admirable colours, and that his great Vncle bought diuers of them and made them tame: But it appeareth that these wilde sheepe or Rams were Musmons, of which we shall discourse afterwards: For wild sheepe are greater then the tame sheep, being swifter to run, stronger to fight, hauing more croked and piked hornes, & therefore many times fight with wilde Boares and kill them. The Subus doth also appeare to be a kind of wild sheepe, Oppianus. for after that Oppianus had discoursed of the sheep of Creete, he falleth to make mention of the Subus, which he saith is of a very bright yellow colour like the sheepe of Creete, but the wooll thereof is not so rough, it hath two large hornes vpon the forehead, liuing both on the water and on the land, eating fish, which in admiration of it in the water gather about it & are deuoured, as we shall shew afterwards in his due place. The Colus also spoken of before & called Snake, seemeth to be of this kind, for it is in quantity betwixt a sheep and a Hart. It hath no wooll, and when it is hunted, the hunters vse neither dogs nor other beasts to take it, but terrifie it with ringing of little bels, at the sound whereof it runneth to and fro distracted, and so is taken: And thus much I thought good to expresse before the generall nature of sheepe, of the diuers and strange kinds in other nations, that so the studious Reader, may admire the wonderfull workes of God, as in all beasts so in this, to whom in holy Scripture he hath compared both his Sonne & his Saints: and for as much as their story to be mingled with the others would haue been exorbitant and farre different from the common nature of vulgar sheepe, and so to haue beene mixed amongest them, might haue confounded the Reader: It was much better in my opinion to expresse them altogether, & so to proceede to the particular nature of vulgar sheepe. And first of all the description of their outward parts: The seuerall parts of sheep the sheepe ought to be of a large body, that so their wooll may be the more, which ought to be soft, deepe, and rough, especially about the necke, shoulders, and belly, and those that were not so the auntient Graetians called Apokoi, the Latins Apicae, that is, peild sheepe, for want of wooll, which alwaies they did reiect as vnprofitable for their flockes: for there is no better signe as Pliny saith, of an acceptable breede of sheepe, Quam crurium breuitas, & ventris vestitus. The shortnesse of the legs, and a belly well cloathed with wooll. The female is to be admitted to the male after two yeares old. Till they are fiue yeare old they are acounted young, and after seuen vnprofitable for breed. In your choise of sheep euermore take those which are rough with wooll euen to their eies, without any baulde place vpon them, and those females which beare not at two yeare olde vtterly refuse, a∣uoid likewise party colored or spotted sheep, but choose them that haue great eies, large tails, & strong legs: let them be yong also, & of breed, Nam melior est ea aetas, quā sequitur spes, quā ea, quā sequitur, mors, & probata est progenies, si agnos solent procreare formosos (saith Petrus Crescen :) that is, that age is better which hope followeth, then that which death fol∣loweth: and it is a good breed of sheepe which bringeth forth beautiful Lambs. And con∣cerning their wooll, it is to be obserued, that the soft wool is not alwaies the best, except it be thicke withal, for Hares haue soft but thin wool, and in sheepe it ought to be contra∣ry, and therefore the most fearefull haue the softest haire, the sheepe of Scythia in the cold countries haue soft wooll, but in Sauromatia they haue hard wool. Florentinus prescribeth that the fine wool of a sheepe is not curled but standeth vpright, for hee saith, that curled wooll is easily corrupted or falsified. The head of the sheepe is very weake, and his braine not fat; the hornes of the female are weake if they haue any at al, for in many places they haue none, like Hinds, and in En∣gland there are both males and females that want hornes: And againe the Rams of En∣gland haue greater hornes then any other Rams in the worlde, and sometimes they haue foure or six hornes on their head, as hath bin often seene. In Affricke their male-sheepe or Rams are yeaned with hornes, and also their females: and in Pontus neither males nor females haue euer any hornes. Their eies ought to be great, and of a waterish colour, and all beasts that want handes haue their eies standing farre distant on their heads, especially sheepe, because they had neede to looke on both sides, and because they are of a simple and harmelesse disposition, as we shall shew afterwards: for the little eie, such as is in Lyons and Panthers, betoken craft and cruelty, but the great eie simplicity and innocency. Their teeth stand in one con∣tinued row or bone, as in a horse, but in the vper chap there are no foreteeth: the male ha∣uing more teeth then the female. There be some that write, that Virgill calleth sheepe Bidentes, because they haue but two teeth, but they doe it ignorantly, for we may read in Seruius, Nigidius and Nonius, that Boares are called Bidentes, and al beasts of two years old, for they were first of all cal∣led Bidennes quasi Biennes, by interposition of the letter D. according to other words, as we do not say reire, but redire, nor reamare, but redamare, nor reargure, but redargure, and so Bidennis, for Biennis, because sacrifices were woont to bee made of sheepe when they were two yeares old. If euer it happen that a sheepe hath but two teeth, it is helde for a monster, and therefore a sheep is called Ambidens, and Bidens, because he hath teeth both aboue and beneath. The belly of a sheepe is like the bellie of a beast that chew the cud. The milke proceedeth from the ventricle or maw. The stones hang downe to the hinder legs. The females haue their vdders betwixt their thighes, like to Goats and Cowes: some of them haue galles, according to the ordinary custome of nature, and some of them haue none at al, for in Pontus where by reason they eat worme-wood they haue no gal. Likewise in Calsis : some we haue shewd haue two gals, and the Scithian sheep haue gals at one time and not at another, as ( Aelianus writeth) for he saith in the verie cold Countries, when snow and winter covereth the earth, there sheepe haue no gals, because they keepe within dores and vse no change of meat, but in the summer when they go abroad againe to feed in the fields, they are replenished with gals. There is a Region in Asia called Scepsis, wherein they say their sheepe haue little or no melts. The raines of a sheepe are equal, and there is no beast that hath them couered with fat like vnto it. Sheepe are also apt to grow exceeding fat, for in the yeare 1547. there was a fat sheepe giuen to the king of France in Pickardy, whereof the inward hooues or cloues of his forefeet were growne to be as long as 8. fingers are broad, the toppes whereof were recurued backward like the hornes of a wilde goat. Concerning their tailes we haue spo∣ken already, for the vulgar sheep haue hairy tailes like Foxes and wolues. And thus much shall suffice to haue spoken of their seuerall parts. In the next place we are to consider the food and diet of sheepe, and then their inclina¦tion, The food of sheepe and institution of shepheardes. and the vtility that ariseth by them, and lastly the seueral diseases with their medicins and cures. It is therefore to be remembred, that the auncients appointed Sheapheardes to attend their flockes, and there was none of great account but they were called sheap∣heardes, or Neat-heardes, or Goat-heardes, that is Bucolisi, Opiliones, and Aepoli, as we haue shewd already in the story of Goats; and the Gentiles do report, that the knowledge of feeding of Oxen and sheepe came first of all from the Nimphes, who taught Aristaeus in the Island of Co. The Graecians therefore call a shepheard Poimem, that is a feeder, of Poimanaime to feed; and the poets also vse Poimantor for a shepherd, and the shepheards Dogs that keepe the flocke from the wolfe, Pominitay kunes, for the sheep being not kept well, be ouercome by the Wolues, according to the saying of Virgill : Nam lupus insidias exptorat ouillia circum. And Ouid likewise saith: Incustoditum captat ouile Lupus. The whole care therefore of the shepheard must be, first for their foode, secondly for their folde, and thirdly for their health, that so he may raise a profitable gaine, either to himselfe or to him that oweth the sheep. To begin with the food. Their diet doth not much differ from Goats, and yet they haue some things peculiar which must now be expressed. It is good therefore, that their pastures and feeding places looke toward the sun setting, and that they be not driuen ouer far or put to too much labour: for this cause the good sheapheard, may safely feed his sheep late in the euening, but not suffer them to go early abroad in the morning. They eat all maner of hearbs and plants, and sometimes kill them with their bitings, so as they neuer grow more. The best is to giue them alwaies greene meate, and to feede them vpon land falowed or plowed to be sowne with corne: and al∣though by feeding them in fat pastures they come to haue a softer wooll or haire, accor∣ding to the nature of their food, yet because they are of a moyst temperament, it is better to feede them vpon the salt and short pasture: for by such a dyet, they both better liue in health, and also beare more pretious wooll. In dry pastures they are more healthy then in the fenny, and this is the cause why it is most wholesome for them to keepe in plowed groundes, wherein they meete with many sweet and pleasant hearbs, or else in vpland medowes, because all moysture breedeth in them rottennesse: he must avoid the woods and shadowy places euen as he doth the fens, for if the sun come not vpon the sheepes food, it is as hurtful vnto him as if he picked it out of the waters: and the shepheard must not thinke that there is any meate so gratefull vnto his cattle, but that vse and continuance wil make them to loath it, wherefore he must prouide this remedy, namely to giue them salt oftentimes in the summer when they re∣turne from feeding, and if he do but lay it in certaine troughs in the folds, of their own ac∣cord they wil licke thereof, and it will encrease in them great appetite. In the winter time when they are kept within doores, they must be fed with the softest hay such as is cut down in the autumne, for that which is riper is lesse nourishable to them: In some countries they lay vp for them leaues, especially green Ewe leaus, or Elme, three-leaued-grasse, sowed-vines, and chaffe or pease, when other things faile: where there are store of vines they gather their leaues for sheep to eat thereof without al danger and very greedily, and I may say as much of the Oliue, both wild and planted, & diuers such other plants, all which haue more vertue in them to fat and raise your beasts if they be aspersed with any salt humor: and for this cause the sea wormwood excelleth all other hearbs or food to make fat sheep. And Myndius writeth, that in Pontus the sheep grow exceeding fat by the most bitter and vulgar wormwood. Beanes encrease their milke, and also three-lea∣ued-grasse, for that is most nourishable to the Ewes with young. And it is obserued for the fault which in latin is called Luxuria segetum, and in English rankenesse of corne, there is no better remedy then to turne in your sheep in May when the ground is hard, if not be∣fore, for the sheep loueth wel to crop such stalks, and also the corne will thriue neuer the worse, for in some places they eat it down twice, and in the country about Babilon thrice, by reason of the great fertility thereabouts, and if they should not do so, Pliny. it would turn or run al into stalke and idle vnprofitable leaues. The same extasie is reported to follow sheep when they haue eaten Eryngia, that we haue expressed already in the history of goats, name¦ly, that they all stand still, and haue no power to goe out of their pastures, til their kee∣per come and take it out of their mouths It is reported that they are much delighted with the herb called Laserpitium which first purgeth them, and then doth fat them exceeding∣ly: It is therefore reported that in S. Cyrene there hath bin none of this found for many yeares, because the publicans that hier the pastures, are enimies to sheepe. For at the first eating thereof the sheep wil sleep, and the goat wil fal a neezing. In India, and especially in the region of the Prasians, it raineth many times a dew like liquid hony falling vppon the hearbs and grasse of the earth: wherefore the shepheards lead their flocks vnto those pla∣ces, wherwithal their cattle are much delighted, and such as is the food they eat, such also is the tast of the milke they render; neither neede they to mingle honny with their milk as the Graecians are constrained to do, for the sweetenesse of that liquor saueth them of that charge. Such a kind of dew the Haebrewes call Manna, the Graecians Aeromelos, and Dro∣somelos : The Germaines Himmelhung : and in English Honny-dew; but if this bee eaten vpon the herbs in the month of May, it is very hurtful vnto them. We haue shewed alrea∣dy that in some parts of Affricke and Ethiopia their sheepe eate flesh and drinke milke, and it is apparent by Philostratus, that when Apollonius trauailed towardes India, in the region Pegades, inhabited by the Orite, they fed their sheepe with fishes, and so also they doe a∣mong the Carmanian Indians, which do inhabit the Sea-coastes: and this is as ordinary with them, as in Caria to feed their sheep with figs, because they want grasse in that coun∣try: and therefore the flesh of the sheep do tast of fish when it is eaten, euen as the flesh of sea-soules. The people of that country are called Ichthyophagi, that is fish-eaters: Likewise the sheepe of Lydia and Masidonia, their sheepe grow fat with eating of fishes. Aenius also writeth of certain fishes about the bignesse of Frogs which are given vnto sheep to be ea∣ten. A eanus In Arabia in the prouince of Ade their Oxen, Camels, and sheep, eate fishes after they be dryed, for they care not for them when they be green: the like I might say of ma∣ny other places, generally it must be the care of the shepard to auoid all thorny and stony places for the feeding of his sheep, according to the precept of Virgill ; Si tibi lamitium curae, primum aspera sylua Lappae{que} tribuli{que} absint. Because the same thing as he writeth maketh them bald, and oftentimes scratcheth their skin asunder, his words are these; Scabras oues reddit cum tonsis illotus, Ad hesit sudor, & hir suti secuerunt corpora, Vepres. Although a sheep be neuer so sound, and not much subiect to the pestilence, yet must the shepard regard to feede it in choice places: for the fat fields breed straight and tall sheep, the hils and short pastures broad and square sheepe: the woods and Mountaine places, small and slender sheep: but the best places of all are the new plowed grounds. Although Virgil prescribeth his shephard to feed his flock in the morning, according to the maner of the country wherein he liued, for the middle part of the day was ouer hot, and not fit for cattel to eat in: yet other nations, (especially Germany and England) and these Nor∣thern parts of the world may not do so. The whole cunning of shephards is excellently de∣scribed, The discripti¦on of a sheap¦heardes eare out of Virgil. for the ordering of their sheepe in these verses following; Ergo omni studio glaciem, ventos{que} niuales, Quo minus est illis curae mortalis egestas, Auertes: victum{que} feres, & virgea laetus Pabula: nec tota claudes foenilia bruma. At vero Zephyris cum laeta vocantibus aestas, In saltus vtrum{que} gregem (oues & capras) at{que} in—pascua Mittes. Carpamus: dum mane novum, dum gramina canent: Luciferi primo cam sydere frigida rura Inde vbi quarta, sitim cali collegerit hora: Et ros in tenera pecori gratissimus herba est. Ad puteos, aut alta greges ad stagna iubeto Et cantu querulae rumpent arbusta cicadae: Aestibus at medijs vmbrosam exquirere vallem Currentem ilignis potare canalibus vndam. Ingentes tendatramos: aut sicubi nigrum Sicubi magna Iouis antiquo robore quercus Tum tenues dare rursus aquas: & pascere rursus Ilicibus crebris sacra nemus accubet vmbra. Temperat: & saltus reficit iam roscida luna: Solis ad occasum: cum frigidus aera vesper Littora{que} halcyonen resonant, & acanthida dumi. When they returne from their feeding, the shepheard must regard that he put them not into the foldes hot, and if the time of the yeare bee ouer hot, let them not bee driuen to pastures a far off, but feed them in those which are neare and adiacent to their folds: that so they may easily haue recourse vnto the shaddow: they ought not also to bee turned out clustering altogether, but disperced abroad by little and little, neither must they bee milked while they are hot, vntil they be cold a little, so likewise in the morning, let them be milked so soone as day appeareth, and the little Lambs be turned out vnto thē which were shut from them. But if their appeare vpon the grasse Spiders-webs, or cob-webs which beare vp little drops of water, then they must not be suffered to feede in those places for feare of poisoning, and in times of heate and raine, driue them to the hiest hils or pastures, which do most of all lie open to the winds, for there shall the cattle feed most temperately: They must auoid all sandy places, and in the month of Aprill, May, Iune, and Iuly, they must not be suffered to feed ouermuch, but in October, September, and Nouember, let them haue their full, that so they may grow the stronger against the winter time. The Ro∣mans had a speciall regard to chuse some places for the summering of their sheepe, and some place for their wintering, for if they summered them in Apulia, they wintered them in Samnius ; and therefore ( Varro saith) the flockes of Apulia betimes in the morning in the summer season are lead forth to feeding, because the dewy grasse of the morning is much better then that which is dry in the middle of the day, and about noone when the season groweth hot, they lead them to shaddowey trees and rocks, vntill the coole aire of the euening begin to returne, at which time they driue them to their pasture againe, and cause them to feed towards the sun rising, for this is a general rule among the shepehards: Quod mane ad solis occasum, & vespere ad solis ortum pascantur oues. That is, That in the morning they feede their sheep towards the sun setting, and in the euening towardes the sun rising, and the reason of it is: Quia infermissimum peccori caput, auerso sole passe cogen∣dum. Because the head of sheepe is most weake, therefore it ought to be fed turned from the sun. In the hot countries a little before the sun setting they water their sheep, and then lead them to their pasture againe, for at that time the sweetenesse seemeth to be renewed in the grasse, and this they do after the autumnall equinoctium. It is good to feede them in corne fields after haruest, and that for two causes. First, because they are exceedingly filled with such hearbs as they find after the plough, and also they tread downe the stub∣ble, and dung the land whereby it becommeth more fruitfull against the next year. There is nothing that maketh a sheep grow more fat then drinke, and therefore we read in holy scripture how Iacob watered his Sheep, and the Daughters of Iethro their sheep, at what time Moyses came vnto them, therefore it is best oftentimes to mingle their water with salt, according to these verses; At cui lactis amor, cytisum lotos{que} frequentes, Ipse manu salsas{que} ferat praesepibus herbas Hinc & amant fluvios magis: & magis vbera tendunt, Et salis occultum referunt in lacte saporem. There bee many that trouble themselues about this question; namely, The reason why the sheepe of England do not drinke for what cause the sheep of England do neuer thirst, except they see the water, and then also seldom drink, & yet haue no more sheep in England then are in any other country of the world: Insomuch as we thinke it a prodigious thing that sheepe should drinke: but the true cause why our English sheepe drinke not is, for there is so much dew on the grasse that they neede no other water; and therefore Aristotle was deceiued, who thinketh that the Northern sheep had mor neede of water then the Southern. In Spaine those sheep bear the best fleeces of wooll that drinke least. In the Iland of Sephalene as we haue shewed in the story of the Goate, all their cattle for want of water do draw in the could aire, but in the hotter coun∣tries euery day once at the least about 9. or ten at clocke in the morning they water their sheepe; and so great is the operation of drinke in sheepe, that diuers Authors do reporte wonders thereof, as Valerius Maximus, and Theophrastus, who affirme that in Macidonia when they will haue their sheep bring forth white Lambs, they lead them to the riuer Ali∣atmon, and when they will haue them to bring forth black Lambs, to the riuer Axius as we haue shewed already. It is also reported that the riuer Scamander doth make all the sheep to be yellow that drinke thereof: Likewise there are two Riuers in Antandria which turne sheepe from blacke to white, and white to blacke, and the like I might adde of the Riuer Thrases, of the two Riuers of Beotia, al which things do not come to passe by miracle, but also by the power of nature, as may appeare by the History of Iacob, when he serued his fa∣ther in law Laban. For after that he had couenanted with Laban to receaue for his stipend all the spotted sheepe, the Scripture saith in this manner: Then Iacob tooke rods of greene Poplar; and of Hayesell, and of the Chesnut tree, and pilled white strakes in them and made the white appeare in the rods. Then he put the rods which he had pilled, into the gutters and watering troughes, when the sheepe came to drinke, before the sheepe, and the sheepe were in heate before the rods, and af∣terwards brought foorth yoong of partie colour, and with small and great spots. And Iacob par∣ted these Lambes, and turned the faces of the flocke towards these partie-coloured Lambes, and all manner of blacke among the sheepe of Laban, so he put his owne flockes by themselues, and put them not with Labans flocke. And in euery Ramming time of the stronger sheepe, Iacob layed the rods before the eyes of the sheepe in the gutters, that they might conceaue before the rods, but when the sheepe were feeble he put them not in, and so the feebler were Labans, and the stronger were Iacobs. Vpon this action of the Patriarke Iacob it is cleare by testimony of holy Scrip∣ture, that diuers colours layed before sheepe at the time of their carnall copulation, doe cause them to bring forth such colours, as they see with their eyes: for such is the force of a naturall impression, as we reade in stories, that faire women by the sight of Blacka∣mores, haue conceaued and brought forth blacke children, and on the contrary, blacke and deformed women, haue conceaued faire and beautifull children; whereof there could be no other reason giuen in nature, but their onely cogitation of and vpon faire beautifull men, or blacke and deformed Moores, at the time of their carnall copulation. So that I would not haue it seeme incredible to the wise and discrete Reader, to heare that the power of water should change the the colour of sheepe: for it being once gran∣ted, that nature can bring forth diuers coloured lambs, being holpen by artificial means, I see no cause, but diuersitie of waters may wholy alter the colour of the elder, as well as whited sticks ingender a colour in the yoonger: And thus much shall suffice to haue spo∣ken concerning the Summering of sheepe. For their Wintering I will say more when I come to entreate of their stabling or housing. Of the copu∣lation of sheepe. Now then it followeth in the next place to discourse of copulation or procreation; for there are diuers good rules & necessary obseruations, whereby the skilfull shepheard must be directed, & which he ought to obserue for the better encrease of his flocke. First of all therefore it is cleare, that Goates will engender at a yeare old, and sometime sheepe also follow that season, but there is a difference betwixt the lambes so engendered, & the other that are begotten by the elder: therefore at two yeare old they may more safely be suffered to engender, and so continue till they be fiue yeare old, and all their lambs be pre∣serued for breeding; but after fiue yeare old their strength and naturall vertue decreaseth, so that then neither the damme nor the lambe is worthy the nourishing, except for the knife, for that which is borne and bred of an old decayed substance, will also resemble the qualities of his sires. There be some that allow not the lambe that is yeaned before the parents be foure yeare olde, and so they giue them foure yeares to engender and breede, namely till they be eight yeare olde, but after eight yeares, they vtterly cast them off: and this opinion may haue some good reason, according to the qualitie of the region wherein they liue, for the sooner they begin to beare yoong, the sooner they giue ouer, and herein they dif∣fer not from Cowes, who if they breede not till they be foure yeare olde may continue the longer, and for this cause I will expresse the testimony of Albertus who writeth thus: Oues parere vs{que} ad annum octauum possunt, & si bene curentur vel in vndecimum facultas pariendi protrahitur, quod tempus est tota fere vita, oues in quibusdam tamen terris marinis vbi sicca & salsa habent pascua viuunt per vigintie annos & pariunt. That is to say, sheepe may breede vntill they be eight yeare olde, & if they be well kept vntill they be eleauen, which time is for the most part the length of their daies, although in some countries vpon the Sea costes, they liue till they be twenty yeare old, and all that time breed yoong ones, because they feede vpon dry and salt pastures, and therefore Aristotle also saith, that they bring forth yoong ones all the time of their life. The time of their copulation as Pliny and Varro write, is from May 'till about the mid∣dle of August, and their meaning is, for the Sheepe of those hot countries. For in Eng∣land and other places the Shepheardes protract the time of their copulation, and keepe the Rammes and Ewes asunder till September or October, because they would not haue their Lambes to fall in the cold Winter season, but in the spring and warme weather: and this is obserued by the auncient Shepards, that if the strongest Sheepe doe first of all be∣gin to engender and couple one with another, Aristotle Albertus. that it betokeneth a very happy and fortu∣nate yeare to the flocke, but on the contrary, if the younger and weaker Sheepe bee first of all stirred vp to lust, and the elder be backward and slow, it presageth a pestilent and rot∣ten yeare. They which drinke salt Water are more prone to copulation then others, Helpes for the copulati¦on of sheep. and com∣monly at the third or fourth time, the female is filled by the Male. There is a great simi∣litude and likenesse betwixt Sheep and Goates. First, for their copulation, because they couple together at the same time. Secondly, for the time they beare their young, which is fiue months, or a hundred and fifty daies: also many times they bring forth twins like Goates, and the Rams must be alwaie so admitted as the Lambes may fall in the spring of the yeare, when all things grow sweete and greene; and when all is performed, then must the Males be seperated from the females againe, that so all the time they goe with young they may go quietly without harme. In their conception they are hindered if they bee ouer fat, for it is with them as it is a∣mong Mares and Horsses, some are barren by nature, and others by accident, as by ouer much leanenesse or ouermuch fatnesse. Plutarch maketh mention of an ancient custome among the Graecians, that they were wont to driue their Sheepe to the habitation of A∣genor, to be couered by his Rammes: And I know not whether he relate it as a story, or as a Prouerbe to signifie a fruitefull and happy Ramming time, I rather encline to the latter because he himselfe saith in the same place, that Agenor was a wise and skilfull King, Mai∣ster of many flockes, whose breede of Sheepe was accounted the best of all that Nation, and therefore either they sent their females to be couered by his Rammes, or else they sig∣nified a happy coniunction of the Rammes and Ewes together. Pliny writeth that if the right stone of a Ram be tyed or bound fast when he leapeth vpon an Eew, Meanes to make the Rams get males or fe∣males. he will engender a male, but if the left stone be tyed he will beget a female. Neare the Citty Patrae there are two Riuers, one of them called Milichus, and the other Charadrus, and the cattle that drinke of this water in the spring time, do beget males, and therfore the shepheards when they bring their Sheep and Goats to that Riuer, they driue them to the farther side of the Riuer, because they would haue more females then males: for that vertue lyeth in one of the sides, but their Kyne they suffer to drinke on that side, because among their heards the male is best, for Buls and Oxen serue them for sacrifice and to till the earth, and therefore the male in that kind, but in al other the female is more acceptable. Both males and females are begotten as wel by the vertues of waters, as by the vertue of the Rammes, and likewise by the vertue of the winde: for when the North wind blow∣eth for the most part males are conceiued, but when the South wind females: and there∣fore ( Aristotle saith:) In admissur ae tempore obseruare siccis diebus habitus septentrionales, vt contra ventum gregem pascamus, & eum spectans admittatur pecus, at sifeminae generandae sunt, austrinos flatus captare, vt eadem ratione matrices ineantur. That is to say, In the Ramming time you must obserue the blowing of the Northerne wind in dry dayes, and not onely feede the flocke against the wind, but also cause the Ram to leape the Eew with his face to the North: but if you would engender females, then must you in like manner obserue the South winde. Vnto this experiment doe Palladius, Aelianus, and Col u∣mella, agree, and these thinges are necessary to bee obserued about the engendering of Lambs. Now after that the Ewe is filled by the Ram, the diligent shephard must haue as great regard to keepe her from abortement, or casting of her Lamb: therefore Aristotle saith, if presently after copulation there fal a shower, or if when they are great with young they eat Wall-Nuts, or Acorns, they wil cast their Lambs: and likewise if in time of thunder the Ewe with yoong be alone in the fielde, the claps of thunder wil cause abortment, Albertus. and the remedy thereof, for the auoyding of that mischiefe, is prescribed by Pliny. Tonitrus (saith he) Solitarijs ouibus abortus inferunt remedium est congregare eas vt coetu inventur, that is to call them together in times of thunder, is a remedy against abortment. There∣fore he requireth of a skilfull shepheard a voyce or whisell intelligable to the sheepe, whereby to call them together if they bee scattered abroad feeding, at the first appea∣rance and note of thunder. It is also reported, that there are certaine vaines vnder the tongue of a Rambe, the colour whereof doe presadge or fore-shew, what will be the co∣lour of the lambe begotten by them: for if they be all white, or all blacke, or all party co∣loured, such also will be the colour of it that they engender. The yeaning of lambes. Bathius Ewes bring foorth for the most part but one at a time, but sometimes two, some∣times three, and sometimes foure, the reason whereof is to be attributed either to the qualitie of the foode whereof they eate, or else to the kinde from which they are deri∣ued: For there bee certaine sheepe in the Orchades, which alwaies bring foorth two at one time, and many of them sixe. There are also sheepe in Magnetia, and Affrick, that bring foorth twice in the yeare: And Aristotle in his wonders writeth, that the sheepe of Vmbria bring foorth thrice in a yeare, and among the Illirians there are sheepe and Goates, that bring forth twice in the yeare, two at a time, yea sometimes three, or foure, or fiue, and that they nourish them altogether, with their aboundance of milke, and be∣sides some of their milke is milked away from them. Egypt is so plentifull in grasse that their sheepe bring foorth twice in a yeare, and are likewise twice lipped: so likewise in Mesapotamia, and in all moist and hot countries. Many times it falleth out that the Ewe dyeth in the yeaning of hir lambe, and ma∣ny times they bring foorth monsters: so also doe all other beastes that are multipara, be∣twixt a Goate and a Ramme, Albertus is a Musmon begottten, and betwixt a Goate bucke and an Ewe is the beast Cinirus engendred, and among the Rhaetians many times there are mix∣ed monsters brought foorth, for in the hinder partes they are Goates, and in the fore∣parts sheepe: for Rammes when they growe strong, olde and wanton, leape vppon the female Goates, vpon which they beget such monsters, but they die for the most part im∣mediatly after the yeaning. Sometimes wilde Rammes come to tame sheepe, and beget vppon these Lambes, which in colour and wooll doe most of all resemble the father, but afterward when they beare yongue, their wooll beginneth to be like to other vulgar sheepe: when the Ewe is ready to be deliuered, she trauaileth and laboureth like a woman, and therefore if the Shepheard haue not in him some mid-wiues skill, that in cases of extremitie, he may drawe out the lambe when the members sticke crosse in the matrix, or else if that be vn∣possible because it is dead in the dams belly, yet to cut it out without perill and daunger to the Ewe, in such cases the Graecians call a Shepheard Embruoulcos. Custody of Ewes and yoong lambs and meanes to encrease their milke. Hauing thus brought the sheepe to their deliuery for the multiplication of kinde, it then resteth to prouide that the new borne lambe may be secured from Dogs, Wolues, Foxes, Crowes, Rauens, and and all enemies to this innocent beast, and also to prouide that the Ewe may render to her yongue one sufficient foode out of her vdder; therefore they must bee well and extraordinarily fed. We haue shewed alreadie the vse of Salt, and then also it is very profitable when the Ewe is newly deliuered of her lambe, for it will make her eate and drinke more liberally. In the Winter time for the encrease of their milke in steede of greene pastures, and such other things as we haue expressed, it is requisite to giue them corne, and especially plenty of beanes. For this cause some prescribe to bee giuen to their sheepe the hearbe Lanaria, which they affirme to be profitable to be giuen to encrease milke, some the stone Ga∣lacites to be beaten to powder, and annointed vppon the Ewes vdder, and some pre∣scribe to sprinckle water and salt vppon them euery morning in the house or fielde, be∣fore the Sunne rising. But herein I leaue euery man to his owne iudgement, hoping it will not be offensiue to any, to relate those things before expressed, and resting in opinion that both the foode that is receiued inwardly, and also the ointments that are applied outwardly, will be suffi∣cient meanes to procure aboundance of milke in the Sommer and Winter seasons. Now therefore it followeth to entreate likewise of the Wintering of sheepe, Of the Win∣tering and stabling of sheepe. for as there is more cost to keepe them in cold weather then in warme, so it doth require at our handes some discourse thereof. Then it behooueth you to prouide for them warme folds and stables whereof the Poet writeth in this manner: Incipiens, stabulis edico in mollibus herbam Carpere oueis, dum mox frondosa reducitur aestas: Et multa duram stipula filicumque maniplis Sternere subter humum, glacies ne frigida laedat, Molle pecus scabiem{que} ferat turpeis{que} podagras. Whereby it is euident that the colde Winters doe beget in sheepe diuers and many diseases, and for that cause it was the counsell of a wise and learned man, that our sheepe should not be turned out to feeding neither in cold or warme weather, vntill the frost were dissolued and thawed from off the grasse and earth. The Tarentine, Graecian and Asian sheepe, were wont to be altogether kept in stables within doores, lying continually vpon plancks and boords boared through, Palladius Pet. Cres∣cent. that so their precious fleeces might be the better safe-garded from their owne filth and vrine, and three times in the yeare they let them out of their stables, to wash them and annoint them with oyle and wine: and to saue them free from serpents, they burned in their stables, and and vnder their cratches, Galbanum, Ceder-wood, womans haire, and Harts hornes: and of these Tarentine and Graecian sheepe, Columella writeth in this manner. It is in vaine for any man to store himselfe with those Tarentine sheepe, for they aske as much or more attendance and costly foode then their bodies are worth; for as all beastes that beare wooll are tender and not able to endure any hardnesse, so among all sheepe, there are none so tender as the Tarentine or Graecian sheepe, and therefore the keeper of them, must not looke to haue any playing daies, nor times of negligence of sluggishnesse, and much lesse to regard his couetous minde, for they are cattell altogether impatient of cold, being sel∣dome led abroad, and therefore the more at home to be fed by hand; and if by couetous∣nesse or negligence, one withdraw from them their ordinary foode, he shall be penny wise, and pound foolish: that is, suffer a great losse in his cattell, for sauing from them a little meate. Euery one of them all the Winter long, were fed with three pintes of Barley, or Pease, or Beanes, three times a day, beside dryed Ewe leaues, or vine leaues, or hay late mowen, or fitches, or chaffe. Besides, there cannot be any milke taken from the dams, for at the first yeaning there is no more then to serue the little or least lambes, and after a few daies, euen while they smell and tast of their dammes belly, they were to be killed for want of sucke, that euery lambe which was to be preserued for breede might haue two dammes or Ewes to sucke, and so the poore Ewe was forced to a double miserie; first to loose her yoong one, and afterward to lend her paps and milke to a stranger. And moreouer, they were forced to nourish more males then females, for that at two yeare olde they were either gelded, or killed, to sell their beautifull skins to the Merchants, for their wooll was most pretious, by reason that neuer or seldome they went abroad to the fieldes: Their cu∣stodie in the house from serpents and other annoyances, is thus described by the Poets: Disce & odoratam stabulis incendere cedrum Galbaneo{que} agitare graues nidore chelydros. Saepe sub immotis praesepibus, aut malat actu Vipera delituit; coelum{que} exterrita fugit Aut tecto assuetus coluber. In consideration whereof, and of all the paines about the housing of these tender sheepe, the Poet teacheth the Shepheard or sheepe-master to kill the serpents, and dash out the braines of snakes, saying: Cape saxa manu, cape robora pastor Tollentem{que} minas, & sibila colla tumentem. Deijce. Concerning the auncient formes of their sheepe stables, The fashion of sheepe coates or stables. I find this to be recorded by the auncients. First, they made them low and not of any high or loftie building, so stretch∣ing them out in length and not in heigth, that it may be warme in the Winter time, for although there be no creature better cloathed by nature then a sheepe, yet is there not any more impatient of cold, nor more apt to take harme thereby. It must not be ouer-broad yet so as the Ewe and her lambe may lye both together, and the breathing place not left open at the top of the house or the sides, for that wil let in too much ayre, but at the doore or porch of their entrance, and that very low, that so the fresh ayre may quickly & easily come to their low heads & bodies, & also their breath the better auoide out of the stable. They also had a care to couer all the flower with strawe or dry boared boords, or some such other matter, whereby they might stand continually dry and warm, and also cleane and sweete, to the end they might not be annoyed in their owne standings; and therefore the floore was made sheluing or falling low on the one side, or else of hurdles like baskets to let out their vrine, for they often make water: and these were often changed, cleansed, and turned. In this stable there ought to be diuisions or partitions wherein in time of ne∣cessitie or sicknesse, they may easily abide alone and be parted from the residue, & feede without anoyance of one another, and especially that one may not ride another, and du∣ring the time of Winter, they did not let their cattell drinke aboue once a day. The manner how in olde time they bought and sold sheepe. And these were the cures of the auncients about their flocks of sheepe. For vppon them they liued, they bought and sold, and herein also it is profitable to obserue the an∣cient manner of their bargaines about these creatures: for when a man came and bought sheepe, he made this protestation to the seller: Tanti sunt mihi emptae ? To whom the sel∣ler answereth, sunt : Then the buyer draweth his money with these words; Sic illasce o es, qua de re agitur sanas recte esse, vti pecus ouillum, quod recte sanum est, extra luscam minam . ventre glabro, ne{que} de pecore morboso esse, habere{que} recte licere, haec si recte fieri respondes? &c. First, the Buyer saith, shall I buye these sheepe for thus much money: and so draweth his money, to whom the Marchant or seller answereth, you shal: Then saith the chapman or buyer againe to him, do you promise me then that these sheepe are as sound as sheepe should be, without fault of winde or limbe, without blindnesse, without deafenesse, with∣out peild bellies, not comming out of any infected flocke; and so as it shall be lawfull for me to inioy them without all mens contradiction, If these things be true, then I will strike vp the bargaine: and yet doth not the seller change the propertie of his sheepe, nor loose his lordship ouer them vntill the money be paid. And hereupon it commeth to passe that the buyer may condemne the seller if the cattell be not so good as his bargaine, or if he doe not deliuer them; euen as the buyer is subiect to the same iudgement, if he doe not deliuer the price. And concerning Shepheards and the custodie of flockes I may adde a word or two more: First of all for the number of the sheepe, how many may safely be kept in euery flocke. There is no neede that I should giue any rules about this businesse, for the auncients were wont to set one Shepheard ouer a hundred rough or course wolled sheepe, and two Shepheards ouer a hundred fine wolled sheepe: the common flockes were seauentie, or foure-score, and the Shepheard that followed them, was charged to be both vigilant and gentle, The generall disciplin of Shepheards▪ and therefore his discipline was: Duci propior esse quam domino, & incogendis, re∣cipiendisque ouibus, ad clamatione, ac baculo minetur nec vnquam telum emittat neque ab his longius recedat, nec aut recubet, aut concidat, nam nisi procedit, stare debet quoniam grex quidem custodis officium sublimem celsissimam{que} oculorum, veluti speculam, desiderat, vt ne{que} tardiores, & grauidas dum cunctantur ne{que} agiles & foetas dum procurrunt seperari à cateris sinat, ne fur aut bestia hallucinantem pastorem decipiat : saith Columella, He must rather be a guide vnto them then a Lord or master ouer them, and in driuing them forward, or recei∣uing them home after they haue stragled, he must rather vse his chiding voice and shake his staffe at them, then cast either stone or dart at them: neither must he goe far from them at any time, nor sit downe but stand stil, except when he driueth them, because the flocke desireth the direction of their keeper, & his eye like a loftie watch-tower, that so he suffer not to be separated asunder either the heauy Ewes great with yong because of their slow pace, nor yet the light & nimble ones which giue sucke, & are deliuered of their yoong, which are apt to run away lest that some rauening beast or theefe deceaue the loytering shepheard by taking away frō him the hinmost or the formost. There may also be more in a flock of sheep then in a flock of goats, bicause the goats are wanton & so disperse them∣selues abroad, but the sheep are meeke and gentle, and for the most part keepe round to∣gether: Yet it is better to make many flockes then one great one, for feare of the pesti∣lence. In the story of the Dogges we haue shewed already how necessary a sheapheards Dog is to the flocke, to defend them both from Wolues and Foxes, and therefore euery shep∣heard must obserue those rules there expressed, for the prouision, choyce, and instituti∣on of his Dogge: and to conclude this discourse of the sheapheard, when the Lambs are young he must not driue their dams farre to pasture, but feede them neare the Towne, village or house, and his second care must bee to picke and cull out the aged and sicke Sheepe euery yeare, and that in the Autumne or Winter time, least they dye and infect their fellowes, or least that the whole flocke do go to decay for want of renewing and sub∣stitution of others, and therefore he must still regard that when one is dead, he supply the place with one or two at the least, and if he chance to kil one at any time for the houshold, the counsell of Antiphanes is profitable to bee followed; Illar tantum mactare debes oues ex quibus nullus amplius fructus, vel casij vel veleris, vel lactis, vel agnorum perniet. That is to kil those sheepe from whom you can neuer expect any more profit by their Lambs, milke, Cheeses, or fleeces. Of the diseases of Sheepe, and their causes in generall. I N the next place it is necessary for the wise and discret sheapheard to a∣voide all the meanes whereby the health of his flocke should be endange∣red, and those are either by reason of their meate and foode that they eat, Of the disea∣ses of sheep. or else by reason of naturall sicknesses arising through the corruption of blood, and a third way is by the biting of venomous beastes, as Serpents, and Wolues, and such like; and a fourth way, Scabbes, Gowtes, swellings, and such like outward diseases. Of venomous meates or Hearbes vnto Sheepe. T Here is an herb which the Latins cal Herba Sanguinaria, pilosella, numularia, and by the Germans & English cald Faenegreek, and by the French because of the hurt it doth vnto sheepe, they vse this circumscription of it: L'herbe qui tue les brebis. The Hearbe that destroyeth Sheepe. It is called also Ser∣pentine, because when Snakes and Adders are hurt therewith, they reco∣uer their woundes by eating therof; when a Sheep hath eaten of this Hearbe, the belly thereof swelleth aboundantly, and is also drawen together, and the Sheepe casteth out of his mouth a certaine filthy spume or froath, which smelleth vnsauourly, neither is the poore beast able to eseape death, except presently hee be let blood in the vaine vnder his taile next to the rumpe, and also in the vpper lip, yet is this Hearbe wholsome to all other cattle exeept Sheepe alone, wherefore the Sheapheards must diligently auoide it. It is a little low Hearbe, creeping vpon the ground with two round leaues, not much vnlike to Parsly, it hath no sauour with it, or smelleth not at all, the flower of it is pale and smelleth strong, and the stalke not much vnlike the flower. It groweth in moist places, and neare hedges and woods. If in the spring time Sheeepe do eate of the dew called the Hony-dew, it is poyson vn∣to them and they dye thereof: Likewise canes in the Autumne do make their belly swell vnto death, if they drinke presently after they haue eaten thereof, for that meat breaketh their guts asunder. The like may be said of Sauine, Tamariske, Rhododendron, or Rose∣tree, and al kindes of Hen-bane. The female Pimpernell doth likewise destroy Sheepe, except assoone they haue ea∣ten of it they meete with the Hearbe called Ferus oculus Wilde-eye, but heerein lyeth a wonder, that whereas there are two kinds of this Hearb, a male and a female, they should earnestly desire a male, and eagerly avoyde a Female, seeing that both of them haue the same tast in the pallate of a man, for they tast like the raw roots of Beets. There is an Hearbe in Normandy called Duua, not much vnlike Rubarbe, or great Gen∣tian, but narrower leaues and standing vpright, the Nearue whereof in the middle is red, and it groweth about the waters, and therefore I coniecture it may be Water-Sorrell, or Water-planton, whereof when Sheep haue eaten, they fall into a disease called also Du∣ua, for there is bred in their liuer certain litle black Worms or Leeches, growing in smal bagges or skinnes, being in length halfe a finger, and so much in breadth, wherewithall when the beast is infected, it is vncurable; and therefore there is no remedy but to take from it the life: and that this is true, the Butchers themseles affirme, how many times they doe find such little Wormes in the Sheepes Lyuer, and they say, they come by drinking of Fenny or marshy-water. And to conclude, there is a kinde of Pannicke also whereof when Sheepe haue eaten it destroyeth them, and there be other Hearbes which euery common Sheapheard knoweh are hurtfull vnto Sheepe, and the beast it selfe though in nature it bee very simple, yet is wise enough to chuse his owne foode, except the vehe∣ment necessity of famine and hunger causeth him to eate poysoned hearbs. In cases when their bellyes swell, or when they haue Wormes in their belly which they haue deuoured with the Herbs they eat, then they poure into their bellies the Vrin of men, and because their bellies presently swell and are puffed out with wind, the Sheap∣heards cut off the tops of their eares, and make them bleede, and likewise beate their sides with their Staffe, and so most commonly they are recouered. If Sheep chaunce to drink in their heate, so as their greace be cooled in their belly, which Butchers do find many times to be true, then the Sheaphard must cut off halfe the Sheepes eare, and if it bleede the beast shall be well, but if it bleed not, he must be killed and eaten, or else he will starue of his owne accord. If at any time a Sheep chance to deuoure a leach, by pouring in oyle into his throat he shall be safe from danger. Of the colds of Sheepe. S Heep are knowne to be subiect to cold, not onely by coughing af∣ter they haue taken it, but also by their strength before they take it, for the Sheapheards do diligently obserue that when any frost or yce falleth vppon a Sheepe, if hee endure it and not shake it off, it is a great hazzard but the same Sheep will die of cold, but if he shake it off and not endure it, it is a signe of a strong, sound, and healthy constitution: Likewise for to know the health of their Sheep, they open their eies, and if the vaines appeare red and small, they know they are sound, but if they appeare white, or else red and ful, they know they are weake, and will hardly liue out Winter or cold weather: also when they are taken in their hands, they presse their backe bone neare the hips, and if it bend not they are sound and strong, but if they feele it bend vnder their hand, they hold them weake and feeble: Likewise if a man take them by the head or by the skinne of the Necke, if he follow him easily when he draweth him, it is a signe of weakenesse and imbicility, but if it doth striue, and follow with great difficulty, then it is a token of health and soundnesse. Of Scabs, and the causes of them. The original cause of Scabs. T He true originall of Scabs is either as we haue said already leanenesse, or else cold, or wet, or wounds in the flesh by clipping, or to conclude by the heate of the beast in summer not washed off, by thornes and prickings of bushes, or by sitting vpon the dung of Mules, Horsses, or Asses. Now when this first of al beginneth, it is easie for the sheapheard to obserue by these signes and tokens, for the tickling or itching humour, lying betwixt the skin and the flesh, causeth the poore sheep either to bite the place with his teeth, or to scratch it with his horne, or to rub it vpon a tree or wall, or if he can do none of these stamp hard vppon the ground with his forefeet, for which it is good presently to separate the sheepe so af∣fected from the flocke. The discription and cure whereof is thus expressed by Virgill : Turpis oues, tentat scabies, vbi frigidus hymber, Altius ad vivum persedit, & horrida cano Bruma gelu: vel cum tonsis illotus ad haesit Sud r, & hir suti secuerunt corpora vepres. Dulcibus id circo fluuijs pecus omne magistri Per fundunt, vdis{que} aries in gurgite villis Mersatur, missus{que} secundo, defluit amni. Aut tonsum tristi, contingunt corpus amurca: Et spumas miscent argenti, viua{que} sulphura, Idaas{que} pices, & pingues vnguine ceras, Scillam{que} helleboros{que} graues, nigrum{que} bitumen. Non tamen vlla magis praesens fortuna laborum est, Quam si qui ferro potuit rescindere summum Vlceris os: alitur vitium, viuit{que} tegendo, Dum medicas adhibere manus ad vulnera pastor Abnegat. which may be englished in this maner: When the poore sheep throgh wet shewers, cold winter, summers sweate, or prickings of thornes, doth incurre the filthy disease of scabs, then it concerneth his maister to wash him in sweet riuers ouer head and eares, yea to cast him in to swimme for his owne life, or else to annoint his body after it is clipped with the spume or froth of oyle, and of siluer with Brimstone, and soft Idean Pitch, with wax, Helli∣bor, black-earth, or the flesh of shrimps, or if it be possible to cut off the top of the wound with a knife. Of the Scabs of Sheepe, the first remedy. THis disease the French-men call Letac, and of all other it is one of the most contagi∣ous, for our english prouerbe iustifieth, one scabbed sheepe infecteth a whole flocke, and Textor writeth thus of it. Oues frequentius quam vllum aliud animal infestantur scabie, quam facit macies vt maciem exiguitas cibi, huic morbo nisi occurratur vnica totum pecus coin∣quinabit, nam oues contagione vexantur. That is to say, Sheep are more oftentimes infected with scabs then any other creature, whereinto they throgh for leanes, as they fall into lea∣nesse through want of food; and therefore if a remedy be not prouided for this euill, one of them infected will defile all the residue, for sheep are subiect to contagion: for remedy wherof in France they vse this medicine. First of all they sheare the sheep, and then they mingle together the pure froath of oyle and water, wherein Hops haue bin sod, and the leeze of the best wine, and so let it soke in two or three daies together: afterwardes they wash them in sea-water, and for want of sea water in salt water, and this medicine is appro∣ued, wherby both scabs and tikes are remoued from the sheep, and also the wooll groweth better afterwards then euer it did before, but it is better if a man can cure them without shearing then by shearing (as Varro writeth,) and furthermore to wash sheep oftentimes with this medicine doth preserue them from scabs before they be infected: and others adde vnto this medicine little stickes of Cypresse wood soked in water, and so wash them therewith, some again make another medicine of Sulphur or Brimstone, Cypresse, white lead, and Butter, mingled altogether, and so annoint their sheep therewith. Some again take earth which is as soft as durt, being so softned with the stale of an Asse, but euermore they shaue the scabbed place first of all, and wash it with cold or stale vrin, and generally in Arabia they were neuer wont to vse other medicine then the gum of Cedar, wherwith∣all they purged away by ointment all scabs from sheep, Camels, and Elephants: but to conclude, there is no better medicine for this euill then vrin, Brimstone, and oyle, as Di∣ophones writeth. Another medicine for the Scabs. TAke the leeze of wine, the froath of Oyle, white Hellibor mingled with the liquor of sod hops, also the iuyce of greene Hemlock which is expressed out of the stalke before it hath seede, after it is cut downe and put into an earthen vessell with any other liquor mingled with scorched salt, so the mouth of the vessel being made vp close, set it in a dung∣hill a whole year together, that so it may be concocted with the vapor of the dung, then take it forth, and when you will vse it, warme it, first of al scraping the vlcerous or scabbed part with an Oyster shell, or else with a sharp pumise stone, vntill it be ready to bleed, and so annoint it therewith. Another medicine for the same. TAke the froath of oile sod away to two parts, I mean 3. parts into two, put therinto the stale vrin of a man, which hath bin heated by casting into it hot burning Oyster-shels, and mingle a like quantity of the iuyce of Hemlock, then beat an earthen pot to powder, and infuse a pinte of liquid Pitch and a pinte of fryed or scorched salt, al which being pre∣serued together, do cure the scabs of sheep so often as they are vsed. Another medicine. A Drinke being made of the iuyce of hops, and the hearb Camaelion, and giuen vnto them cureth them. Likewise the same being sod with the roots of black Camaelion, & annointed warm vpon the place, according to Dioscorides haue the same operation. Like∣wise Pliny writeth, that the scabs of sheepe may be cured by salt water alone, either taken out of the sea or made by art, & forasmvch as there is great danger in the decoction there∣of, least that the water ouercome the salt, of the salt ouercome the water, he prescribeth a mean how to know it, namely the equall and iust temperament thereof, for (saith he) if it will beare vp an Egge then is it well tempered, so that the Egge will swim and net sinke, which you shall find by addition of aequall and iust quantity of water and salt, that is, two pints of water, a pinte of salt, and so lesse to lesse, and more to more. But if there be any bunch or great scab which couereth any part of the skinne, then open the scab and bunch and poure into it liquid pitch and scortched salt: and thus much for the disease of the scabs. Of the holy fire which the Sheapheards call the Pox, or the Blisters, or Saint Anthonies fire. THis euill is vncurable, for it neither admitteth medicine nor resication by knife, and therefore whensoeuer a beast is infected therewith, it ought presently to be seperated from the residue of the flocke, for there is nothing that spreadeth it selfe more speedily: whensoeuer you aduenture to apply any thing vnto it, it presently waxeth angry, and per∣plexeth the whole body except it bee the milke of Goates, and yet my Author speaketh thus of it: Quod infusum tantum velet, vt & blandiatur igneam saeuitiam differens magis oc∣cisionem gregis, quam prohibens. That is, It seemeth to close with raging fire, as it were to flatter it a little, rarher deferring the death of the beast, then doing away the disease. It is therefore prescribed by the most memorable Author of al the Egyptians, that men doe oftentimes looke vpon the backes of their sheep to see the beginning of this sicknesse, and when they find a sheep affected herewith, they dig a ditch or hole fit for him at the ente∣ring in of the sheepe-coate or stable, wherin they put the sheep aliue with his face vpward, and backe downeward, and cause all the residue of the flocke to come and pisse vpon him, by which action it hath bin often found (as Columella writeth) that this euill hath bin dri∣uen away, and by no other meanes. Of the warts, and cratches of Sheepe. THis disease is called by the vulgar sheapheardes the Hedghog, and it doth anoye the sheep two manner of waies; first when some gauling or matter ariseth vppon the pa∣ring of the hoofe, or else a bunch arise in the same place hauing a hayre-growing in the middle like the haire of a dog, and vnder that a little worme, the worme is best drawne out with a knife, by cutting the top of the wound, wherein must bee vsed great warinesse and circumspection, because if the worme bee cut asunder in the wound, there issueth out of her such a venemous pustulate matter, that poysoneth the wound, and then there is no remedy but the foot must be cut off. But the wound being opened and the worme taken out aliue, presently with a wax-candle you must melt into it hot burning sewet, and if there be no bunch but onely scabs, take Allum, liquid Pitch, Brimstone, and Vineger, ming∣led all together, and apply it vnto the wound, or else take a young Pomgranate before the graines grow in it, and bake it with Allum, casting vppon it vineger, sharp wine, and the rust of yron fryed altogether. Of the falling sicknesse. IT commeth to passe sometimes that sheepe are infected with the falling sicknesse, but the cure hereof can neuer be knowne, nor yet the sicknesse well til the beast be dead, and then (as Hippocratus writeth) by opening of the braine it wil euidently appeare, by the o∣uer great moystnesse thereof. Of the paines in the eies. IT is reported by Theophrastus and Pliny, that for cloudes and other paines in the eie of a sheepe, horned-poppy and Chamaelia are very wholsome. Of phlegme in Sheepe. FOr the remedy of this disease take Peniroial, or Margerum, or wild Nep made vp togi∣ther in wooll, and thrust into the nose of the sheepe, there turned round vntill the beast begin to neeze, also a stalk of blacke Hellibor boared through the eare of the sheepe, and there tyed fast for the space of foure and twenty hours, and then taken out at the same time of the day that it was put in, by Pliny and Collumella is affirmd to be an excelent remedy a∣gainst the Phlegme. Of the swelling in the iawes. THere is sometimes an inflammation or swelling in the iawes of sheepe, which the La∣tins call tonsillae, comming by reason of a great flux of humours from the head vnto that place, which may be cured two manner of waies, first, by incision or opening the skin where the bunch lyeth, wherby all the watery tumors are euacuated, and the beast cured, or else if through the coldnes of the weather or some other accident you list not to cut the skin, then annoint it with liquid pitch, prepared in such manner as is before expressed for the scabes, by operation whereof, it will be dissolued and dispersed: When this euill ariseth in the beginning of the spring, many times it is cured without all reme∣die, because the beast for the greedinesse of the sweete grasse stoopeth downe her head, and stretcheth her necke, by which the straining and sorenesse of her iawes and throat de∣parteth, and this sicknesse in a sheepe is like the Kings euill in a man. There be some that cure it by putting salt among the meate of these beasts, or by Guniper berries, and Harts∣toong leaues beaten to powder. For the cough, and paine in the lungs. SHepheards for these diseases do take the powder of the root of Foale-foot, and mingle it with salt, so giue it vnto the sheepe to lick, whereby they are perswaded, that the lungs of the beast are much comforted and strengthned, and furthermore against the cough, they take blanched Almonds, and beat them to powder, and so tempering them in two or 3. cups of wine, do infuse it in at the sheeps nostrilles, and likewise veruine which is cal∣led a kind of Germander, but falsely, because it hath no good smel, is giuen by shephards at this day vnto their sheep against the cough. Of sighing, and shortnesse of breath. FOr sheepe that are affected with much sighing, they vse to bore a hole with an yron through their eares, and remoue the sheepe out of the place where they feed to some other place, and if it come from the sicknes of the lungs, then the hearb called Lungwort or Creswort, is the most present remedy in the world: If the root therof be drunke in wa∣ter, or a piece thereof tyed vnder the sheepes tongue, or (as Celsus saith) giue vnto it as much sharp vineger as the beast can endure, or halfe a pint of a mans stale vrine warmed at the fire, and infused into the nostril with a little horn, this also is a remedy against flegme in the summer time. Of the loathing of Sheepe, and encreasing of their stomacke. IF at any time the sheepe forsake his meate, then take his taile and pull off from it all the wooll▪ afterwards binde it as hard as euer you can, and so he will fall hard to his meat a∣gaine: and Pliny affirmeth, that the same part of his taile which is beneath the knot wil die after such binding, and neuer haue any sence in it againe. Of the fluxes of sheepe, and loosenesse of the belly. FOr this disease the Sheapheardes take no other thing but the Hearbe Tormentia, or Set-foyle wherwithall they stop all manner of laxes, but if they cannot get the same Hearb, then they take salt and giue it vnto them, and so hauing encreased their thirst, they giue vnto them black wine, whereby they are cured. Of the melt of Sheepe. IN Aprill and May through the aboundance of thicke grosse blood, the melt of sheepe is stopped and filled, then the sheaphards will take two of their fingers, and thrust them within the nostriles of the sheep, there rubbing them vntill they make them bleed, and so draw from them as much blood as they can. Of the sicknesse of the Spleene. FOr as much as a Horse, a Man, and a Sheep, are troubled with the same diseases, they are also to be cured with the same remedies, and therefore Spleen-wort giuen vnto sheep, as to a man and a Horse (as wee haue already expressed) is the best remedy for this Malady. Of the Feauers of Sheepe. SOmetimes a shaking rage through an incensed and an vnnaturall heat of the blood in the sheepe begetteth in him a Feauer, the best remedy whereof is to let him bloud, ac∣cording to these verses; Quin etiam iam dolor balantum lapsus ad ossa, Cum furit, at{que} artus depascitur arida febris: Profuit incensos aestus auertere: & inter Ima ferire pedes salientem sanguine venam, Quam procul aut molli succedere saepius vmbrae Videris, aut summas carpentem ignauius herbas, Extremam{que} sequi, aut medio procumbere campo Pascentem, & serae solam decedere nocti. Continuò ferro culpam compesce: priusquàm Dira per in cautum serpant cantagio vulgus. In which verses the Poet defineth the signes of this disease and the cure. The signes he saith are solitarinesse, and a carelesse feeding, or biting off the top of his meat, following alwaies the hindmost of the flock, and lying down in the middle of the field, when others be a fee∣ding, also lying alone in the night time, and therefore he wisheth to let them bloud vnder the pasterne or ankle bone of their foot, but by often experiment it hath bin proued that to let them bloud vnder the eies or vpon the eares, is as availeable as in the legs, but con∣cerning the Feauer we will say more in the discourse of the Lambes. Of the pestilence or rottennesse of Sheepe. THis sicknesse first of al commeth vnto Sheepe out of the earth, either by some earth∣quake, or else by some other pestilent humor corrupting the vitall spirit, for Seneca writeth, that after the Citty Pompeij in Champania was ouerthrowne by an earth-quake in the winter time, there followed a pestilence which destroyed sixe hundered sheep about that citty in short time after, and this he saith did not happen through any naturall feare in them, but rather through the corruption of water and aire which lyeth in the vpper face of the earth, and which by the trembling of the earth is forced out, poysoning first of all the beasts because their heads are downeward and feede vpon the earth; and this also will poyson men if it were not suppressed and ouercome by a multitude of good aire which is aboue the earth. It were endlesse to describe all the euils that come by this disease, how some consume away by crying and mourning, filling both fields and hils with their lamen∣tations, leauing nothing behinde them, no not their skins or bowels for the vse of man: For the cure whereof: First change the place of their feeding, so that if they were infected in the woods or in a cold place, driue them to the hils or to sunny warme fields, and so on the contrary, if in warme places & clementaire, then driue them to more turbulent and cold pastures: remoue and change them often, but yet force them gently, waying their sicke and feeble estate, neither suffering them to dye through lazinesse and idlenesse, nor yet to be oppressed through ouermuch labour. When you haue brought them to the place where you would haue them, there deuide them asunder, not permitting aboue two or three together, for the disease is not so powerfull in a few as in a multitude; and be well assured that this remouing of the aire and feeding is the best phisicke. Some do pre∣scribe three-leaued-grasse, the hardest roots of reeds, Sand of the Mountaine, and such other Hearbs for the remedy of this, but herein I can promise nothing certain, only the sheapheard ought oftentimes to giue this vnto his sheepe when they are sound. I wil con∣clude therefore this discourse of the pestilence with the description of Virgil ; Balatu pecorum, & crebris mugitibus amnes, Arentes{que} sonant ripae colles{que} supini Iam{que} cateruatim dat stragem: at{que} aggerat ipsis In stabulis, turpi dilapsa cadauera tabo, Donec humo tegere, ac foueis abscondere discunt, Nam ne{que} erat corijs vsus: nec viscera quisquam Aut vndis abolere potest, aut vincere stamma. Nec tondere quidem morbo, illuvie{que} peresa Vellera, nectelas possunt attingere putres. Verum etiam inuisos si quis tentarat amictus Ardentes papulae, at{que} immundus olentia sudor Membra sequebatur: nec longo deinde moranti Tempore, contactos artus sacer ignis edebat. It is reported by Iohn Stowe, that in the third yeare of Edward the first, and in Anno 1275. there was a rich man of Fraunce, that brought a sheepe out of Spaine (that was as great as a calfe of two yeare olde) into Northumberland, and that the same sheepe fell rotten, or to be infected with the Pestilence, which afterward infected almost all the sheepe of England: and before that time the pestilence or rottennesse was not knowne in England, but then it tooke such hold, and wrought such effects, as it neuer was cleare since, and that first Pestilence gaue good occasion to be remembred, for it continued for twentie and sixe yeares together. And thus much for this disease of the Pestilence caused in England for the most part in moist and wet yeares. Of Lice and Tikes. I F either Lice or Tikes doe molest sheepe, take the roote of a Maple tree, beate the same into powder, and seeth it in water, afterwards clip off the wooll from the backe of the sheepe, and poure the said water vpon the backe, vntill it hath compassed the whole body: some vse for this purpose the roote of Man∣dragora, and some the rootes of Cypresse, and I find by good Authors, that all of them are equiuolent to rid the sheep from these anoyances: to conclude therfore the discourse of sheeps diseases, it is good to plant neare the sheepe-coates, and pa∣stures of sheepe, the hearbe Alysson, or wilde gallow-grasse, for it is very wholesome for Goates, and sheepe, likewise the flowers of worme-wood dryed and beaten to powder gi∣uen vnto sheep with salt, doth asswage all inward diseases and paines, and also purge them throughly. The Iuice of Centorie is very profitable for the inward diseases of sheepe, & likewise the flowers of Iuey, the hoome tree hath foure kinds of fruite, two proper, the nut, and the grraine, two improper, the line, and hiphear, this hipheare is very profi able for sheep, and it is nothing else but a confection made out of the barks of the hoome-tree▪ the word itselfe is an Arcadian word, signifying no other thing then viscus and stelis. Sheep also delight in the braunches of maiden-haire, and generally the wooll of sheepe burned to powder and giuen them to drinke, is very profitable for al their inward dise ses: And thus much shall suffice to haue spoken of the seuerall infirmities and sicknesses of sheepe, which I desire the English Reader to take in good part, wondering very much at the ma∣ny fold wits, and stirring pens of these daies, wherein I thinke our times may be compa∣red to the most flourishing times that euer were since the worlds beginning; yet none haue aduentured to apply their times and wits for the explication of the seuerall sicke∣nesses of sheepe and cattell. I know there are many Noble men, Knights, and Gentlemen of the land, and those also which are very learned, that are great masters of sheepe and cattell, and I may say of them as the Prophet Dauid saith: Their Oxen are strong to labor, and their sheepe bringeth forth thousands and ten thousands in their fieldes : Whereby they are greatly inritched, and yet not one of them haue had so much commisseration, either towards the poore cattell in whose garments they are warmed, or charitie to the world. For the better direction to maintaine the health of these creatures, as to publish any thing in writing for the benefite of Adams children, but such knowledge must rest in the brests of si ly Shepheards, and for the masters either they know nothing, or els in strange visitation and mortalitie of their cattell, they ascribe that to witchcraft and the diuell, which is peculiar to the worke of nature. Horses, Dogs, and almost euery creature, haue gotten fauour in Gentlemens wits, to haue their natures described, but the silly sheepe better euery way then they, and more necessary for life, could neuer attaine such kindnesse, as once to get one page written or indighted for▪ the safegard of their natures, I do therfore by these presence from my soule and spirit, inuite all Gentlmen and men of learning, not onely to giue their mindes to know the defects of this beast, but also to inuent the best remedies that nature can afford, for it is a token of highest mercy vnto bruite beasts to feede them when they are hungry, and to recouer them when they are sicke. Columella and Varro two great Romanes, and such as had attained to some of the grea∣test place of the Common-wealth, being men of excellent wits and capacitie, yet had their names been forgotten & they neuer remembred, if they had not written of rustick and countrey matters, and it is no little honor vnto them to haue left that behind them in Print, or writing, which themselues had obserued from following the plough. Therefore it shal be no disgrace for any man of what worth soeuer to bestow his wits vpon the sheep, for certainely it is no lesse worthy of his wit, then it is of his teeth; and how necessarie it is for the nourishment of man, we all know to this daye, and besides there is nothing that so magnifyeth our English Nation as the price of our Wooll in all the kingdomes of the World. But what account the auncients made of Sheepe, I will now tell you: for their greatest men both Kings and Lordes were Sheapheardes, and therefore you which succeede in their places shall bestow much lesse labour in writing of sheepe then they did in keeping: with the picture of a Sheepe they stamped their auncient mony, and it is reported of Mandrabulus, that hauing found a great treasure in the earth, in token of his blind thankefulnesse to God, did dedicate three pictures of Sheepe to Iuno, one of Gold, another of Syluer, and a third of Brasse; and besides the ancient Romans made the penalties of the lawes to be Oxsen and Sheep, and no man might name an Oxen vntil he had named a sheep. Among the Trogladites they had their Wiues common, yet their Tyrants had lawes to keepe their wiues to themselues, and they thought it a great penalty for the adultery of their wife, if the adulterer payed them a sheepe. The Poets haue a pretty fiction, that Endimion the Sonne of Mercury fell in loue with the Moone, who dispised him, and that therefore he went and kept Sheepe: afterward the Moone fell in loue with his white Sheepe, and desired some of them, promysing to grant his request, if he would gratifie her choyce: whereupon the Wise-man (as Probus writeth) deuided his flock into two partes, the whiter on the one side which had the cour∣ser Wooll, and the blacker on the other side which had the finer Wooll, so the Moone chose the white one, and graunted him her loue, whereupon Virgill thus writeth: Pan munere niueo lunae captum te luna fefellit. It may appeare also in what great regard Sheepe were in auncient time, for that their Priestes made holy Water and sacrifices for their santification, whereof I finde these re∣lations, in Gyraldus, Virgil, and others. At the lustration of Sheepe there was another manner of sanctifieng then at other times, for the Sheapheard rose betimes in the mor∣ning, and sprinkled his Sheepe all ouer with Water, making a perfume round about the fold, with Sulphar, Sauine, Lawrell, Wine and fire, singing holy verses, and making sa∣crifice to the God Pan, for they did beleeue that by this lustration the health of their Sheepe was procured, and all consuming diseases driuen away. It is reported that when Sheepe of strange colours were sprinkled with this water, it signified great happinesse to the princes of the people, and they were gifts for the Empe∣ror, whereupon Virgill made these verses; Ipse sed in pratis, aries iam suaue rubenti Murick, iam croceo mutabit vellera luto. When men went to receiue answers of the Oracles, they slept all night in the skinnes of Sheep. There was a Noble sacrifice among the Pagans called Hecatombe, wherein were sacrificed at one time a hundred Sheepe at a hundered seueral alters. It is reported of King Iosias, that hee sacrificed at one time twelue hundered Oxen, and eight and thirty hundered sheepe, so great was the dignity of this beast, that God himselfe placed in the death thereof one part of his worship: and whereas it was lawfull among the heathens to make their sacrifices of Seepe, Goates, Swine, Oxen, Hennes, and geese, they made reckoning that the lambe and the Kid was best of all, for that God was not pleased with the quantitie but with the qualitie of the sacrifice. The auncient Egyptians for the honor of sheepe, did neither eate nor sacrifice them, and therefore we reade in holy Scripture, that the Israelites were an abhomination to the Egyptians, because they both killed, and sacrificed sheepe, as all Diuines haue declared. There is a noble story of Clitus who when he sacrificed at the Altars, was called away by King Alex∣ander, and therefore he left his sacrifices and went to the King, but three of the sheep that were appointed to be offered did follow after him, euen vnto the Kings presence, whereat Alexander did very much wonder (and that not without cause,) for he called together all the wise men & South sayers to know what that prodegy did fore-shew, whereunto they generally answered that it did fore-shew some fearefull euents to Clitus, for as much as the sheepe which by appointment were dead, that is, ready to die, did follow him into the presence of the King, in token that he could neuer auoid a violent death, and so afterwards it came to passe; for Alexander being displeased with him because (as it is said) he had raild on him in his drunkennes, after the sacrifice commanded him to be slaine, and thus we see how diuine things may be collected from the natures of sheep. These things are reported by Plutarch, & Pausanias. Another note of the dignity of sheep, may be collected from the custome of the Lacedemoniās : When they went to the wars they droue their goats & their sheep before them, to the intent that before they ioyned battell they might make sacrifice to their Gods: the goats were appointed to lead the way for the sheep, for they were droue formost, and therefore they were called Cataeades, and on a time this miraculous euent fell out, for the wolues set vpon the flocks, & yet contrary to their rauening nature, they spa∣red the sheepe, and destroyed the goats; which notable fact is worthy to be recorded, be∣cause that God by such an example among the heathen Pagans, did demonstrate his loue vnto the good in sparing the sheepe, and his hatred vnto the wicked in destroying the goates, and therefore he reserued the sheepe to his owne Altar: Idibus alba Ioui, grandior agna cadit So saith Ouid : Nigram hiemi pecudem zephyris falicibus albam So saith Virgil. And againe: Huc castus Hibilla Nigrarum multo pecudum te sanguine ducet. To Iupiter and to the sunne, they were wont to sacrifice white sheepe or lambes, but to Pluto and to the earth, they sacrificed blacke sheep or lambes, in token of deadnes: There∣fore Tibullus writeth: Interea nigras pecudes promittite Diti And Virgil saith: Duc nigras pecudes ea prima piacula sunto. When the Graecians sent their spies to the tents of the Troyans, to discouer what order strength, and discipline they obserued: Nestor and the ancients of Greece, vowed vnto the Gods for euery one of the captaines a seuerall gift, that was, Oin melainan, thelen hyporre∣non, that is a black sheep great with yong: the reason whereof is giuen by the Scholiast, they vowed (saith he) a blacke sheep, because the spies went in the night time, blacknesse being an emblem of darkenes, and a sheepe great with young because of good fortune, for they spedde well in Troy. In Apolonia there were certaine sheepe that were dedicated to the sunne, and in the day time they fed neere the riuer in the best pasture, being lodged euery night in a goodly spatious caue neere the Cittie, ouer whom the greatest men both for wealth, strength, and wit, were appointed euery night to watch by turnes for their better safegard, and the reason of this custody, and the great account made of these sheepe, was for that the Oracle had commanded the Apolonians to do so vnto them, and make much of them: Afterwards Euenius a noble man among them keeping watch according to his turne, fell asleep, so that threescore of the said sheep were killed by wolues, which thing came in question among the common magistrats to know the reason of that fact, Coelius Herodotus & how it came to passe whether by negligence or by some other violent incursion: Euenius being no waies able to defend it, was condemned to haue both his eies put out, that so he might be iudged neuer more worthy to see the light with those eyes, which wold not wake ouer their charge, but winke and sleep when they should haue been open: and to conclude, I will but adde this one thing more, that whereas the Egyptians worshipped the sheep for a God, God permitted the same vnto the Iews to be eaten among cōmon & vulgar meats, and also to be burned at the Altar for sacrifice; and whereas the said Egyptians did not onely eat but sacrifice swines flesh, God himselfe did forbid his people that they should neuer eate nor taste of swines flesh as an abhominable thing: by which he signifieth how contrarie the precepts of men are to his owne lawes, for that which hee forbiddeth, they allow, and that which they allow, he forbiddeth; and therefore how farre the people of God ought to be from superstition, and from the traditions of men, is most manifest by this comparison, for that was neuer sanctified that came not into the Temple, and that was neuer lawfull which was not approoued by God: and those things which in his law haue greatest appearance of crueltie, yet are they more iust and equall then the most in∣different inuentions of men, which seeme to be stuffed out with mercie, and gilted ouer with compassion. And these things most worthy Readers, I haue thought good to expresse in this place for the dignitie and honourable account which the greatest men of the world in former times haue made of sheepe, and thereby I would incite and stir you vp, if it were but one noble spirited learned man, which is furnished with witte, meanes, and opportunitie, to diue and pierce into the secrets of English sheepe, and Shepheards, and to manifest vn∣to the world the best, and most approoued meanes and medicines, for the propulsing and driuing away of all manner of diseases from those innocent profitable beasts, and for their conseruation in all manner of health and welfare. I am sorry that our times are so farre poysoned with couetousnesse, that there is no regard of God, man, or beast, but onely for profit and commoditie: for as for the ser∣uice of God we see that the common deuotion of men, and practise of their religion, is founded vpon a meer hope that therfore God wil better prosper them in worldly affaires, and if it were not for the reward in this world, the professors of religion would not be halfe so many as now they are; and that is true in them which the diuell slaunderously ob∣iected to Iob, namely that they doe not serue God for nothing, and they had rather with iues haue the diuels fauour in rich garments and delicate fare, then with Lazarus with misery and contempt, enioy the fauour of God, and to set vp their hopes for an other world. As for men we see that the sonne loueth his Father but for patrimony, and that one man ma∣keth much of an other, for hope to receaue benefite and recompence by them; and there∣fore it is no maruell if the silly beastes haue obtained so little mercy, as to be loued, nor because they are Gods creatures, but for that they are profitable and seruiceable for the necessities of men: for this cause you nourish them, and not like the Apolonians aforesaid for the Oracles sake, but for their fleeces and their flesh. Therefore if you haue any com∣passion, learne how to helpe their miseries, and publish them to the world for the general benefite, for he cannot be good which is not mercifull vnto a beast, and that mercie doth easily die which groweth but in one hart of one mortall man. There were a company of people in Egypt called Lycopolitae, who worshipped a wolfe for a God, and therefore they alone among all the Egyptians did eate sheepe, because the Wolfe did eate them; euen so I can make no better reckoning of those men that nourish sheepe for their profit onely, then I do of the Lycoplitaes, which worshipped a Wolfe, for such men haue no other God but their belly, and therefore I trust these reasons shall perswade some one or other to write a large discourse of our English sheepe. Now in the next place we are to discourse of the vtilities that commeth by sheep, Of the s ue∣ral by . for as it is the meekest of all other beastes, so as the rewarde of meekenesse, there is no part of him but is profitable to man: his flesh, blood, and milke is profitable for meat, his skin and wooll both togither and assunder for garments, his guts and intrals for Musicke, his hornes and hooues for perfuming and driuing away of Serpentes, and the excrements of his belly and egestion or dung, for the amending and enriching of plowed lands, and for these occasions did the Egyptians worship it for a God, for that they could see no creature in the world, but had some parts altogither vnprofitable vnto men, but in this they found none at all. First of al therefore to beginne with their flesh, although Physitians haue their seuerall conceites thereof, as Galen, (who saith) that the flesh of Hares is better then the flesh of Oxen and Sheepe: and Simeon Sethi. who being forced to confesse the goodnesse of Mut∣ten or Sheepes-flesh in the beginning and middle of the spring, (yet writeth) that it is ful of superfluities and euil iuice, and hurtfull to al flegmy and moist stomackes▪ Crescentien∣sis also writeth, that the flesh of a Sheepe hath an vnpleasant tast through ouermuch hu∣midity, and fit for none but for country-labouring-men: Indeed I graunt the opinion of Platina, who writeth thus concerning Rams: Ouem arietem dentibus ne atting as, non modo enim eius caro non prodest, verum etiam vehementer ouest, that is, That Rammes flesh wee ought neuer to touch, for it is not onely vnprofitable, but it is much hurtfull: yet in En∣gland the flesh of Rammes is vsually eaten, either through the craft or subtilty of the but∣chers, or else through couetousnes. But in many houses (as I haue hearde) there is a kind of Venison made of the flesh of Rammes, which is done by this meanes: First they take the Ramme (and beat him with stripes on all parts til the flesh grow redde, for such is the nature of the blood, that it wil gather to the sicke affected places, and there stande to comfort them, so by this meanes after the Ramme is killed the flesh looketh like Venison: But as in other discourses, namely, Hares and Conies, wee haue already shewed our ha∣tred of all cruel meates, so also I vtterly dislike this, for if it be not sufficient to kill and eat the beast, but first of all put it to Tyrrannical torments, I cannot tell what wil suffice, ex∣cept we will deale with beastes, as PILATE did with CHRIST, who was first of all whipped and crowned with thornes, and yet afterward did crucifie him. But for the taking away of that Rammy humour and ranke moistnes which is founde in the Male-sheep, they vse to geld them when they are young and sucke their dammes, or else within the compasse of a yeare after their yeaning, whereby the flesh becommeth so temperate, sweet, and sauoury, as any other flesh in the worlde; and if they passe a yeare, then do they vse to knit them, and so in time their stones depriued of nourishment from the body by reason of knitting, do drie and consume away, or vtterly fall off, whereby the whole flesh of the beast is made very seasonable and wholesome: It is granted by al, that when they are young, that is to say a yeare old, their flesh is very wholesome, & fit for no∣rishment of mans nature, but that they increase much phlegme, which euil is alaied by eating Viniger and drinking wine vnto it. In many places they salt their Muttens when they are killed, and so eat them out of the pickle, or else roast them in the smoake like Ba∣con. Within the territory of HELVETIA, there is a publicke law whereby the Butchers are forbidden to buy any forren sheep, after the feast of Saint Iames, that is, the fiue and twentie day of Iuly, for although that after that time they grow fat, yet is their flesh then lesse wholesome, and their fatte more hurtful, then that which is gotten in the springe of the yeare. It were needlesse for me to set downe the diuision of a deade sheepe into his quarters, shoulders, legges, loines, rackes, heades, and purtinances, for that they are commonly knowne, and the relation of them can minister smal learning to the reader, but euery part hath his vse, euen the blood that is taken from him when his throat is cut, hath his pecu∣liar vse for the norishment of man, and aboue al other thinges the fat of his loines com∣monly called his sewet wherein it excelleth al other beasts whatsoeuer for their reines, are couered al ouer with fat. of their milk. Their is no lesse vse of their milke not onely for young, but for old persons, and aswel for the rich to beautifie their tables, as for the poore to serue their hungry appetites, and there be some people in Affricke that haue no corne in al their country, and therefore in∣steede of bread, their common food is milke, the goodnesse whereof is thus expressed by Fierra. Quod praestat? Caprae, post? Oues, inde boues. Euermore the milke of an Ewe is best that is newest and thickest, and that which com∣meth from a blacke Sheepe is preferred before that which is milked from a white, and ge∣nerally there is no beast whereof we eate but the milke thereof is good and nourishable, therefore the milke of sheepe is preferred in the second place, and there is no cause that it is put in the second place but for the fatnesse thereof, otherwise it deserued the first, for as the fatnesse maketh it lesse pleasant to the palate and stomack of man, yet is it more pre∣tious for making of Cheese; and we haue shewed already that in some places as in the I∣sland Erythrea, the milk of a Sheep yeildeth no whaie, and that they can make no cheese therof, but by mingling abundance of water with it; they make abundance of cheese in the Apenine hils, and in Lyguria : the Cheese of Sicilia is made of Goates and sheepes milke, and generally Cheese made of sheepes milke is the better the more new it is. The nature of a sheepe is to giue milke eight moneths togither, and in Italy they make Butter also of the milke of sheepe, al the Summer time vnto the feast of Saint Michaell they milke them twice a day, but after that, vntil they coople with their Rammes they milke them but once a day, the faults of cheeses made of their milke is either because they are ouer dry or hol∣low, and full of eyes and holes, or else clammy like burd-lime, the last proceedeth from the want of pressing, the second through ouermuch salt, and the third by ouermuch dry∣ing in the Sun. And thus much shal suffice to haue spoken of those things in sheep which are fit to be eaten. In the next place we come to discourse of their wool, and of the shearing or clipping of sheepe, for although their flesh be pretious, yet it is not comparable in value of their flee∣ces, for that when they are once dead they yeild no more profit, but while they liue, they are shoarne once or twice a yeare, for in Egypt they are shoarne twice a year, and also in some parts of Spaine. And it appeareth that in auncient times there were great feastes at their sheepe-shearings, as is apparant in the holy scripture in many places, and especially by the History of Absalon, who after he had once conceiued malice against his Brother Ammon, he found no opportunity to execute the same, vntill his sheepe shearing-feast, at which time in the presence of all his brethren the kings sons (euen at dinner) when no man suspected harme, then did Absalon giue a signe to his wicked Seruants to take away his life, which they performed according to their maisters malice. It appeareth by the wordes of Pliny who writeth thus, Oues non vbi{que} tondentur durat quibusdam in Locis vellendimos, qui etiam nunc vellunt ante triduo ieiunas habent, quo lan∣guida minus radices lanae retinent: That is, Sheepe are not euery where shoarne, for yet vnto this time in many places they do commonly obserue the old custome of pulling the wooll off from the sheepes backe, and they which doe now pull the wooll and not sheare it, do alwaies cause their sheepe to fast three daies before, that so being made weake the roots of the wooll may not sticke so fast, but come off more easily. And indeed I am confirmed in this opinion by the Latine word Vellus which signifi∣eth a fleece, which can bee deriued from no other Radixe or Theame, nor admit any other manner or kinde of notation, then A ellendo, that is, from pulling. Cato also in his booke of Originalles writeth thus, Palatini collis Romae altera pars velleia appellata fuit, à vellenda lana ante Hetruscam tonsuram incolis monstratam, That is, to say: There was one part of the hill Palatine at Rome, which was called Velleia from the pulling of wooll, for it was their custome there to pull their wooll, before the inha∣bitauntes learned the Hitrutian manner of shearing sheep, by which testimony we see euidently the great torment that the poore sheepe were put vnto when they lost theyr fleeces, before the inuention of shearing, for it is certaine by the auncient pictures and statues of men that there was no vse of shearing either haire or wooll, from men or sheepe. But the haire of men grew rude, and in length like womens, and sheepe neuer lost their fleeces but by pulling off, and therefore Varro writeth, that foure hundred and fifty yeares after the building of Rome there was no Barber or sheep-shearer in al Italy, and that Publius Ticinius Menas was the first that euer brought in that custome among the Romans, for which there was a monument erected in writing in the publicke place at Ardea, which vntill his time was there sincerely preserued. Now concerning the times and seasons of the yeare for the shearing of sheepe, it is not onely hard, but also an impossible thing to set downe any general rule to hold in al places. The best that euer I read is that of Didimus. Nec frigido ad huc, nec iam aestiuo tempore, sed medio vere Oues tondendae sunt, That is, sheepe must neither bee shoarne in extreame colde Weather, nor yet in the extreame heate of Summer, but in the middle of the spring. In some hot countries they sheere their sheepe in Aprill, in temperate countries they sheere them in Maie, but in the cold countries in Iune, and Iuly, and generally the best time is betwixt the vernall equinoctium, & the summers solstice, that is before the longest day, and after the daies & nights be of equall length, there be some that sheere their sheep twice in a yeare, not for any necessitie to disburden the beast of the fleece, but for opinion that the often shearing causeth the finer wooll to arise, euen as the often mowing of grasse maketh it the sweeter. Columella In the hot countries the same day that they sheere their sheepe they also annoint them ouer with oyle, the leeze of old wine, and the water where∣in hops are sod, and if they be neere the sea side, three daies after they drench them ouer head and eares in water, Palladius Celsus but if they be not neere the sea side, then they wash them with raine water sod with salt; and hereby there commeth a double profit to the sheepe: First, for that it will kill in them all the cause of scabs for that yeare, so as they shall liue safe from that infection: and secondly, the sheepe doe thereby grow to beare the longer and the softer wooll. Some do sheare them within doores, and some in the open sunne abroad, and then they chuse the hottest and the calmest daies, and these are the things or the neces∣sary obseruations, which I can learne out of the writings of the auncients about the shea∣ring of sheepe. Sharing time in Eng∣land. Now concerning the manner of our English nation, and the customes obserued by vs about this businesse, although it be needlesse for me to expresse, yet I can not con∣taine my self from relating the same, considering that we differ from other nations. First therefore, the common time whereat we sheare sheepe is in Iune, and lambes in Iuly; and first of all we wash our sheepe cleane in running sweete waters, afterward letting them dry for a day or two, for by such washing all the wooll is made the better and clea∣ner: then after two daies we sheare them, taking heede to their flesh, that it be no maner of way clipped with the sheares, but if it be, then doth the shearer put vpon it liquid pitch, commonly called Tarre, whereby it is easily cured and kept safely from the flies. The quantitie of wooll vpon our sheep is more then in any other countrey of the world, for euen the least among vs (such as are in hard grounds) as in Norfolke, the vpper most part of Kent, Hertfort-shier, and other places, haue better and weightier fleeces then the greatest in other nations: and for this cause the forraine and Latine Authors doe ne∣uer make mention of any quantitie of wooll they sheare from their Sheep, but of the quallitie. The quantitie in the least is a pound, except the sheep haue lost his wooll, in the middle sort of sheepe two pounds or three pounds, as is vulgar in Buckingham, Northampton, and Leicester shieres; But the greatest of all in some of those places, and also in Rumney marsh in Kent, foure or fiue pounds: and it is the manner of the Shepheards and sheepe masters to wet their Rams, and so to keepe their wooll two or three years together grow∣ing vpon their backs, and I haue credibly heard of a Sheepe in Buckingham-shiere in the flocke of the L.P. that had shorne from it at one time, one and twentie pound of wooll. After the shearing of our sheepe, we doe not vse either to annoint or wash them, as they doe in other nations, but turne them foorth without their fleeces, leauing them like mea∣dowes new mowen, with expectation of another fleece the next yeare. The whole course of the handling of our sheepe is thus described by the flower of our English-Gentlemen husbands master Thomas Tusser. Wash Sheepe for the better where water doth runne, And let him goe clanely and dry in the Sunne Then sheare him and spare not, at two daies an end, The sooner the better his corps will amend, Reward not thy Sheepe when yee take off his coate With twitches, and flashes as broad as a groat: Let not such vngentlenesse happen to thine Lest flie with her gentles doe make him to pine, Let Lambes goe vnclipped till Iune be halfe worne, The better the fleeces will grow to be shorne, The Pye will discharge thee for pulling the rest, The lighter the Sheepe is, then feedeth it best. And in another place of the husbandry of sheepe he writeth thus: Good farme and well stored, good housing and dry, Good corne and good dairy, good market and nigh, Good Sheapheard, good till man, good Iack and good Gill, Makes husband and huswife their coffers to fill: Let pasture be stored and fenced about, And tillage set forward as needeth without. Before you do open your purse to begin, With any thing doing for fancy within, No storing of pasture with baggagely tit, With ragged and aged as euill as it: Let carren and barren be shifted away, For best is the best, whatsoeuer you pay. And in another place speaking of the time of the yeare for gelding Rams, and selling of wooll which he admonisheth should be after Michelmas, he writeth thus: Now geld with the gelder, the Ram and the Bull, Sew ponds, amend dams, and sell Webster the wool. But of the milking of sheepe he writeth thus: Put Lambe fro Ewe, to milk a few, Be not to bold, to milke and fold, Fiue Ewes alow, the euery Cow, Sheepe wrigling taile, hath mads without faile. And thus far Tusser, The value of English wool and the vse thereof besides whom I find little discourse about the husbandry of Sheepe in any English Poet. And for the conclusion or rather farther demonstration of this part, concerning the quallity of our English wooll, I can vse no better testimony then that of worthy M. Camden, in his Brittania, for writing of Buckinghamshire he vseth these words: Hac tota fere campestris est, solo item argillacos tenaci & foecundo, Papulosis pratis innumeros o∣uium greges pascit, quarum mollia & tenuissima vellera ab Asiaticis vs{que} gentibus expetuntur. That is to say, The whole county of Buckingham is of a clammy, champaigne, fertile soile, feeding innumerable flocks of sheep with his rich and well growen pastures or med∣dowes, whose soft and fine fleeces of wooll are desired of the people of Asia; For we know that such is the trade of Marchandise and transportation of English cloath, the rare fine∣nesse, and smoothnesse thereof is admired in Asia; namely, in Palestina, and other king∣domes of the Turke, and therefore they haue English houses of Marchants, both at Alep∣po, Tripoli, and other places. Againe speaking of Lemster ore, or Lemster wooll in Herford∣shire, he writeth thus: Sed ei precipua hodie gloria est a lana in circum vicinis agris (Lemster o∣re vocant) cui excepta Apula & Tarentina, palmam deferunt Europoei omnes. The greatest glo∣ry of that soile is in their wool, which ariseth from sheep, feeding in the fildes and pastures adioyning thereunto, (which wooll they call Lemster ore ) and all Christendome yealdeth praise and price vnto it next after the Apulian and Tarentinian wooll. And indeed so sweet is the gaine that commeth by sheep, that in many partes of the land there is a decay of tillage and people, for their maintenance, and therefore the saide M. Camden saith most worthily, euen like himselfe, that is honest and vnpartiall in all his writings, for in the beginning of his description of Northamtonshire, where I thinke a∣boue all parts depopulation and destroying of townes is most plentiful, (so that for Chri∣stians now you haue sheepe, and for a multitude of good house-holders, you shall haue one poore Sheapheard swaine and his Dogge lyuing vppon forty shillinges a yeare, or little more,) hee writeth in the wordes of Hythodaeus after the commendation of the Sheep and Wooll of that Country: Ouibus oppleta & quasi obsessa, quae (vt Hythodaeus il∣le dixit) tam miles esse tamque exigno ali solebant, nunc (vtifertur) tam educes atque indo∣mita esse corperunt vt homines deuorent, ipsos agros, domos oppida vascent, ac depopulentur: which words I canot better english then in the words of an Epigrammatarian in our ages, for to this effect, according to my remembrance he writeth, Sheepe haue eate vp our pastures, our meddowes, and our downes, Our Mountaines, our men, our villages and Townes; Till now I thought the common prouerb did but iest, That saies a blacke sheepe is a biting beast. Concerning the goodnesse of english wool, and the difference of it from others, the rea∣son is well giuen by Gesner and Cardan: Lanae earum molles & crispae sunt, ideo{que} nunc vt o∣lim milesia celebratur nec mirum cum nullum animal venenatum mittat Anglia, & sine lupo∣rum metu pecus vagetur nulli enim in Anglia hodie lupi reperiuntur, Rore caeli sitim sedant gre∣ges ab omni alio potu arcentur quod aquae ibi ouibus sint exitiales. That is to say, The wool of English sheep is soft and cur ed, and therefore it is now commended as highly as euer was the Meletian wooll in ancient time, and not without iust cause, for they are neither anoid with the feare of any venemous beast, nor yet troubled with Wolues, and therefore the strength of their nature and peaceable quiet wherin they liue, doth breed in them the bet∣ter wooll; and besides they neuer drinke, but quench their thirst with the dew of heauen: And thus much for the discourse of English wooll. The wool of ther coun∣tries. I am neuer able sufficiently to describe the infinite commodities that come vnto men by wooll, both for gardens, for hangings, for couerings, for hats, and diuers such other things, and therfore it shal not be vnpleasant I trust vnto the reader, to be troubled a little with a farther discourse heereof, if I blot some paper in describing the quality of the best wooll in other nations. First of al therefore we are to remember these two things that the best wooll is soft and curled, and that the wool of the old sheep is thicker and thinner then the wooll of the younger, and the wooll of the ram followeth the same nature, of whom we will speake more in his story. Onely in this place our purpose is to expresse the exami∣nation of wooll as we finde it related by Authors, according to their seuerall countries. Therfore as we haue said already out of M. Chambdens report, the Tarentinian and Apuleian wooll must haue the first place, because the sheep of those countries liue for the most part within doores, and besides that, are couered with other skins. In Spaine they make grea∣test account of the blacke wooll, and it appeareth by good History, both in our English chronicle and others, that the sheepe of Spaine were of no reckoning til they were stored with the breed of England. There is a little country called Pollentia neare the Alpes, of the wooll whereof Martial maketh mention, as also of the Canucine red wooll, and there∣fore Ouis Canucina was an Emblem for pretious wooll, his verses are these: Non tantum pullo, lugentes vellere lanas, Roma magis fussis vestitur gallia ruffis Canucinatus nostro syrus assere sudet. We haue spoken already of the wooll of Istria and Liburnia, which if it were not for the spinning in Portugall, and the web-sters Art thereupon, it were no better for cloth then haire. Strabo writeth, that the wooll of Mutina, whereby he meaneth all the country that lyeth vpon the riuer Seutana, is very soft and gentle, and the best of Italy; but that of Li∣guria and Myllain, is good for no other vse but for the garments of seruants. About Padu their wooll is of a meane price, yet they make of it most pretious workes of Tapistry, and Carpets for tables, for that which was rough and thicke in ancient time was vsed for this purpose, and also to make garments, hauing the shags thereof hanging by it like r gs. There is a citty called Feltrum, and the wooll thereof by the Marchants is called Feltriolana, felt-wooll, they were wont to make garmentes hereof neither wouen nor sewed▪ but baked together at the fire like hats and caps, whereof Pliny writeth thus: Lanae & per se coactae vestem faciunt, & si addatur acetum etiam ferro resistunt imo vero etiam ignibus nouissimo sui purgamento quippe ahenis coquentium extracte indumentis vsu veni∣unt ga earum vt arbitror inuento, certe gallicis hodie nominibus discernuntur. Wooll hath this property, that if it be forced together it will make a garment of it selfe, and if vineger bee put vnto it, it will beare off the blow of a sword, dressed at the fire and purged to the last, for it being taken off from the brazen coffer whereon is was dressed, it serued for clo∣thing, being as hee thought an inuention of the Gals, because it was knowne by French names, and from hence we must see the beginning of our felt-hats. The Betican wooll is celebrated by Iuuenall, when he speaketh how Catullis fearing shipwrack, was about to cast him out into the water; Infecit natura pecus, sed & egregius fons, Viribus occultis & Boeticus adiuuat aer. For the colour of Wooll in that country groweth mixed, not by any art, Of the co∣lors of wooll but naturally through their food, or their drinke, or the operation of the aire. The Lauoditian wooll is also celebrated, not onely for the softnesse of it, but for the colour, for that it is as blacke as any Rauen, and yet there are some there of other colours, and for this cause the Spa∣nish wooll is commended, especially Turditania, and Coraxi (as Strabo writeth,) for hee saith the glasse of the wooll was not onely beautifull for the purity of the blacke, but also it will spin out into so thin a thread as was admirable, and therefore in his time they sold a ram of that countrey for a tallent. I may speake also of the wooll of Parma, and Altinum, whereof Martiall made this disticon; Velleribus primis apulia: Parma secundis Nobilis altinum tertia laudat ouis. We may also read how for the ornament of wooll, there haue bin diuers colours inuen∣ted by art, and the colours haue giuen names to the wool, as Simatulis lana, wooll of Sea∣water-colour, some colour taken from an Amethist stone, some from brightnesse or clear∣nesse, some from Saffron, some from Roses, from Mirtles, from Nuts, from Almonds, from Waxe, from the Crow, as Colorcoraxicus, and from the purple fish, as from the Co∣lassiue, or the Tyrean, whereof Virgill writeth thus; Hae quo{que} non cura nobis leuiore tuendae, Nec minor vsus erit, quamuis Milesia magno, Vellera mutentur tyries in cocta rubores. From hence commeth the chalke colour, the Lettice colour, the Loote-tree-root, the red colour, the Azure colour, and the star-colour. There is an Hearb called Fullers-herb, which doth soften wooll, and make it apt to take colour, and whereas generally there are but two colours, black and white that are simple, the ancients not knoing how to die wool, did paint it on the outside for the triumphing garments, in Homer wore painted garments. The Phrigian garments were colours wrought with needle-worke, and there was one At∣talus a King in Asia, which did first of all inuent the weauing of wooll and gold together, whereupon came the name of Vestis Attalica, for a garment of cloath of gold. The Babilonians and the Alexandrians loued diuersity of colours in their garments also; and therefore Mettellus Scipto made a law of death against all such as should buy a Babilonish garment, that was carpets or beddes to eate vpon for eight hundered Cesterses. The shea∣ring of cloth or garments made of shorne cloth, did first of all begin in the daies of S. Au∣gustine, as Fenistella writeth. The garments like poppies had the original before the time of Lucilius the Poet, as he maketh mention in Tarquatus. There was a fashion in ancient time among the Romans, that adistaffe with wooll vpon it, The lasting of wooll. was carried after virgins when they were going to be married: the reason therof was this (as Varro writeth) for that there was one Tanaquilis or, Cayea cecilia, whose distaffe and wooll had endured in the Temple of Sangi many hundered yeares, and that Seruius Tullus made him a cloke of that wooll, which he neuer vsed but in the temple of Fortune, and that that garment afterwards conti∣nued fiue 500 & 60. years, being neither consumed by moaths, nor yet growing thread∣bare, to the great admiration of all which either saw it or heard of it. And thus much I thought good to adde in this place concerning the diuersity of wooll, distinguished natu∣rally according to seuerall regions, or else artificially after sundry tinctures. Likewise of the mixing and mingling of Wooll one with another, and diuersities of garmentes, and lastly of the lasting and enduring of wooll and garments, for it ought to be no wonder vn∣to a reasonable man, that a wollen garment not eaten by mothes, nor worne out by vse, should last many hundered yeares, for seeing it is not of any cold or earthly nature, but hot and dry, there is good cause why it should remaine long without putrification: and thus much instead of many things for the wooll of sheepe. As we haue heard of the manifold vse of the Wooll of Sheepe, so may we say very much of the skins of Sheep for garments and other vses: and therefore when the wool is detracted and pulled off from them, The vs of ep-skins they are applyed to Buskins, Brest-plates, Shooes, Gloues, Stomachers, and other vses, for they are also dyed and changed by tincture into other colours, & also when the wool is taken off from them, they dresse them very smooth and stretch them verye thin, whereof is made writing parchment, such as is commonly vsed at this day in England, and I haue knowne it practised at Tocetour, called once Tri∣pontium in the county of Northampton: and if any part of it will not stretch but remaine stiffe and thicke, thereof they make writing tables, whereon they write with a pensil of iron or Brasse, and afterward deface and race it out againe with a spunge or linnen cloath: Here of also (I mean the skins of sheep) commeth the coueringes of bookes, and if at any time they be hard, stubborne, and stiffe, then they soften it with the sheepes-sewet or tallow. The bones of Sheep haue also their vse and employment for the hafting of knifes. The Rhaetians of the vrine of sheep do make a kind of counterfeit of Nitre. And Russius saith, that if a man would change any part of his Horses haire, as on the forehead, take away the black haires and put them into white, let him take a linnen cloth and wet it in boyling milk of sheep, and put it so whot vpon the place that he would haue changed, so oftentimes to∣gether til the haire come off with a little rubbing, afterward let him wet the same cloth in cold sheeps milke, and lay it to the place two or three daies together, and the haire will arise very white, thus (saith he:) and there are certain flyes or mothes which are very hurt¦full to gardens, if a man hang vp the panch of a sheepe, and leaue for them a passage or hole into it, they will all forsake the flowers and hearbs, and gather into that ventrickle, which being done two or three times together, make a quit riddance of all their hurts, if you please to make an end of them. Ruellius The Swallowes take off from the backes of Sheepe flockes of Wooll, wherewithal the prouident Birds do make their nestes to lodge their young ones after they bee hatched. With the dung of Sheepe they compasse and fat the earth, Of the dung of sheepe. it beeing excellent and aboue all other dung necessary for the benifit and encrease of Corne, except Pigeons and Hens dung which is whotter, and the sandy land is fittest be amended with Sheeps dung, also piants and trees if you mingle therewith ashes. Now we are to proceed to the gentle disposition of Sheep, and to expresse their inward quallities and morall vses, The inward qualities of sheepe and their moral vses Hermolaus and first of all considering the innocency of this beast, I mar∣uaile from whence the Gortynian Cretian custome proceeded, which caused adulterers for their punishment to ride throughout the whole Citty crowned with Wooll, except that so they might signifie his tender and delicate effeminacy; and therefore as some are crow∣ned with gold in token of vertue and valiant acts▪ so vice (especially the wantonesse of the flesh) deserueth to be crowned with wooll for the loosenesse and beastlinesse thereof, not because such a crowne was a sufficient punishment, for an opprobry and continuall badge of ignomny, euen as forgerers and periured persons ride with papers on their heads, vp∣on bare horse backs, and so forth. By the behauiour of Sheepe at their rutting or ramming time the Sheapheardes ob∣serue tempests, Aratus. raines, and change of weather. If they be very lustfull and leape often vp∣on their females, but if they be slow and backward, then is the poore naked man glad, for that thereby hee conceiueth hope of a gentle Winter, and temperare weather. Also if in the ende of Autumne they stampe vppon the grounde with their feete, it betokeneth hard weather, colde Winter, much Frost and Snow, about the time of the first ry∣sing of the Pleiades or seauen Starres. Which thing is thus poetically expressed by A ie∣nus ; —Si deni{que} terram, Lanigerae fodiant caput aut tendantur in arcton, Cum madidus per marmora turbida condit, Pleiadas occasus, cum brumae in frigora ce it, Frugifer Autumnus, ruet aethra concitus Imber. Concerning the simplicity of sheep, I must say more, and also of their innocency, yet the simplicity thereof is such, and so much, that it may well be termed folly, or Animal inep∣tissimum, for Aristotle writeth thus of it: Repit in deserta sine causa, hyeme obstante ipsum sae∣pe egreditur stabulo, occupatum à niue, nisi pastor compulerit, abire non vult, sed perit desistens, nisi mares à pastore ducantur ita enim reliquum grex sequitur. That is, Without cause it wan∣dereth into desert places, and in the winter time when the aire is filled with cold windes, and the earth hardened with hoare frostes, then it forsaketh and goeth out of his warme coate or stable, and being in the cold Snow, there it will tarry and perish, were it not for the care of the sheapheard, for he taketh one of the Rams by the hornes, and draweth him in a doores, then do all the residue follow after. They are also very obedient to the voice and cal of the sheapheards, and to the barking and cry of their Dogs, and no lesse is their loue one toward another, euery way commendable, for one of them pittieth and sorrow∣eth for the harme of another, and when the heate of Sunne offendeth them, Albertus wri∣teth, that one of them interposeth his body to shaddow the other. Their dam o Ewe loueth her Lambe, and knoweth it by smelling to the hinder partes, and if at any time he dam do not loue or make reckoning of her young one, they giue hir the Hearbe Penny wo t or Water-wall to drinke in water, and then as the Scholiast affir∣meth▪ natural affection increaseth in hir. Of the foolishnesse of sheep, ther was an Emblem to signifie by a man riding vpon a golden fleece, one ruled by his seruant or wife; Tranat aquas residens pretioso in vellere Phryxus, Et flauam impauidus per mare scandit ouem. Ecquid id est? vir sensu hebeti sed diuite gaza. Coningis aut serui quem regit arbitrium. And therefore Aristophanes reprouing the stolidity of the Athenians, calleth them sheepe: And Origen writing vpon Leuiticus saith: Ouiū immolatio affectuum stultorum, & irrationa∣bilium correctio. The sacrificing and killing of sheep, is nothing else but the correction of our foolish and vnreasonable affections. We haue shewed already in the story of the goat, of a Goat that nourished a Wolues Whelpes, which in the end did destroy her, and the selfe same is ascribed also to a sheep. They obserue great loue and concord with Goats, and liue in flocks together, Loue and ha¦tred of sheep and for this cause it happeneth that moe goates are destryed by Wolues then sheepe, for that the Goates forsake their fellowes, and straggle abroad for food, but the sheepe very sildome: Aristotle and it is obserued that if a Wolfe kill a sheepe, and afterwardes any garments be made of the wooll of that sheepe, they easily and more speedily breed Lice and vermin then any other, and also procure itch in the bodies of them that weare them, whereof Cardan gi∣ueth this reason: Haud mirum videri debet ouis pellem a lupo dilantatae pruritum mouere, nam ob vehementem metam, tum etiam ob contrariam naturam mali afficitur, et si mori enim vltimū sit supplicium, mag is tamen afficitur corpus in vno quam in altero genere, metuit homo magis in mari fluctuans quam coram hostibus. It ought not (saith he) moue any man to wonder that the wooll of a sheep torne asunder by a wolfe should beget and breed itch, for that affecti∣on ariseth from both, from the vehemency of the feare before it bee dead through the sight and sence of the wolfe, and also by reason of a contrary nature that it is oppressed and deuoured by, and although death be the last punishment, yet we see diuers affections fol∣low dead carkases after death, and as a man is more afraid of the sea when he is in perrill of death therein, then of the face of his enemy, so is it in this case, betwixt the Sheepe and the wolfe. The same Cardan affirmeth▪ that sheepe are afraid of wolues euen after death, for the Wooll of a sheepes skinne will fall of in the presence of a Wolfe. Vnto this subscribeth Oppianus, or rather Albertus receiued it from Oppianus, and furthermore (it is said) that if the strings of a Sheepes and Wolues guts be fastened to one and the same instrument, they will neuer make good Harmony; and furthemore if a drumme be made of a Sheeps skinne, and another of the Wolues skinne, the drum of the Sheepes skinne will iarre and sound vnpleasantly in the presence of the Wolues skin: but of these things I haue no cer∣taine grounds, onely I say that there may be naturall reason from the substance and mat∣ter, both of one and other, why this accident may chance without discorde and hatred of each other, but from the difference and solidity of the matter; as for example, the guts of a wolfe are strong and hard, and wil abide greater strain then the guts of a sheep, if there∣fore the musitian will straine the one like the other, it must needes fly asunder: likewise the skin will giue a deeper and lowder sound vpon a drum, by reason of the substance then a sheepes: and so some may ignorantly ascribe that difference to an antipathy in nature, for as a Candle in the presence of a great Torch or fire, giueth lesse light to they eye, so doth a drum made of a Sheepes skin, lesse sound to the sence of hearing, in the presence of another made of stronger and harder beastes skin: and to conclude, as a twine thread will not hold stretching in the presence, (I meane in comparison of a silke thread) al∣though it be of the same quantity, euen so will not a Lute string made of a Sheepes gut, in comparison of another made of out of a Wolfe. But all the question is how it com∣meth to passe, that one of the skinnes hanged vp in the presence of the other should bee consumed before the other, that is a Sheeps skinne in the presence of the Wolfes, as a Gooses skinne will loose the feathers before the Eagles. The answe s easie, for the dry∣er that the body is, the lesse excremen tall humor it conteineth, and so wil last the longer, and all wilde siluestriall beastes are dryer then the tame, moder , and domesticall, as for example, the Wolfe then the Sheepe, the Lyon then the Dogge, the Pheasant then the Cocke, the Eagle then the Goose: and for these causes the skinne of the one doe wast be∣fore the other, not for feare or secret opposition, but for want of better enduring sub∣stance. Coelius The Poets do ascribe vnto their Gods Laneos pedes, feet made of Wooll, for that they come softly and suddainely without noyse to take vengeaunce vppon male-factors; and therefore when they discribe Saturne tyed vp a whole yeare with bandes of Wooll, their meaning is, to shew how with patience he forbare his wrath and indignation. Bees are enimies to Sheepe, and there are no cattell that doe so much inrich men as Sheepe and Bees. There is a story in Suidas and Hesychius, of one Crysamis, who was very rich in Sheepe in the Island of Cous, and there came euery yeare an Eele and stole away his best Sheepe among all the flocke, at last he met with it and slew it; afterward the ghost of the Eele ap∣peared to him in the night, warning him (for feare of other harme) to see him buryed. Chrysamis neglected it, and therefore he and all his family perished. By which story I can∣not ghesse any other meaning, but that some man stole away his Sheepe, and for that hee tooke vpon him a priuate reuenge, most inhumanly suffering him to lye vnburyed, and setting more by a beast then the life of a man, as a iust punishment of God he perished: and thus I conclude this naturall and morall discourse of the Sheepe with that fiction of Esop, who writeth that on a time as the Sheapheardes were making merry in a cottage, and ea∣ting a Sheepe, the Wolfe came and looked in, saying vnto them: Atqui ego sitantum fa∣cerem, quantum cieretis tumultum. If I should eate a Sheepe as you doe, you would all rise in an vprore: which is fitted against them that make good lawes and obserue none them∣selues. OF THE RAM. H Auing thus made a general description of the sheepe, wherein we haue spent no more time then was fit and conuenient, The seueral names of Rams. we are nowe forced to the seuerall species and kinds, and first of al, order and na∣ture teacheth vs to discourse of the male, which in our English lan∣guage is called a Tup or Ramme, deriued I do not doubt from the French Ran, although also they call him Belier, the Germaines Ho∣den wider and Hammell, the Italians Montone, and Ariete, the Spani∣ardes Carnero, the Heluetians Ramchen, the Graecians in auncient time Krios, Ariacha, Ceraste, and now in these daies Kriare, the Haebrewes Ail, or Eel, the Chaldees plurally Dikerin, the Arabians Kabsa, and the Persians Nerameisch. Now con∣cerning the Greeke and Latine names, there is some difference among the learned about their notation, Etymology, or deriuation; for although they all agree that Aries est dux & maritus pecorum, yet they cannot consent from what root, stem, or fountaine, to fetch the same. Isidorus bringeth Aries ab aris, that is, from the Altars, because the sacrifising of this beast was among all other sheepe permitted, and none but this except the Lambs. Other deriue it of Aretes, which signifieth vertue, because that the strength and vigor of sheepe lyeth in this aboue all other, for there is in his hornes incredible strength, in his mind or inward partes incredible courage and magnanimity, but the truest deriuation is from the Greeke word Arneios. Some Latines call him also Nefrens, and plurally Nefrendes, for distinction from the weather or gelded sheepe, for the stones were also called Nefrendes, and Nebrundines, and the Epithets of this beast are, horne-bearer, insolent, violent, fighting, fearfull, writhen, swift, wool-bearer, leaping, head-long, warriour, and in Greeke, meeke, gentle, and fa∣miliar, and is not known by the name Ctilos, for that it leadeth the whole flock to the pa∣stures, and backe againe to the foldes. And thus much may suffice for the name and de∣monstratiueappellation of this beast, now we will proceed forward to the other partes of his story, not reiterating those things which it hath in common with the sheepe alreadie described, but onely touching his speciall and inseperable proper qualities. First of all for the election of Rams fit to be the father of the flocke, The chiefe of Rams for breed. and to generate and increase yssue, and therefore Varro and others call him Admissarius Aries, a stallion Ram. They were woont to make choise of such an one from an Ewe that had brought foorth twinnes, for that it is conceiued, he will also multiply twins; for first in the choyse of a Ram they looke vnto his breed and stocke from whence he is discended, and then to his forme and outward partes, as in Horses, Oxen, Dogges, Lyons, and almost all crea∣tures. There are races and stockes which are preferred one before another, so is it also in Sheepe, and therefore require that he be Boni seminis pecus, a Ram of a good breede, and next of the forme and outward parts, although some neuer look further then colour, but Collumella aduiseth that his wooll, palate of his mouth, and toongue be all of one co∣lour, for if the mouth and tongue be spotted, Palladius such also will be the yssue and lambes he be∣getteth, for we haue shewed you already, that the Lambe for the most part followeth the colour of the Rams mouth, such a Ram is thus described by the Poet: Illum autem quamuis aries sit caudidus ipse, Nigra sub est vdo tantum eui lingua palaeto Reijce, ne maculis infuscet vellera pullis Nascentum. And therefore forasmuch as the young ones do commonly resemble the father, Crescentiu and bear some notes of his colour, let your Ram be all blacke or all white, and in no case party-co∣loured, and for the stature and habite of his body let it bee tall and straight, a large belly, hanging downe and well cloathed with wooll, a taile very long and rough, a broad fore∣head, large stones, crooked-winding-hornes towards his snowt, hauing his eares, couered with wooll, a large breast, broad shoulders and buttockes, his fleece pressed close to his body, and the wooll not thin nor standing vp. And for the hornes, although in all Regi∣ons Rams haue not hornes, yet for windy and cold countryes the great horned beastes are to be preferred, Columell for that they are better able through that defence to beare off winde and weather, yet if the climate be temperate and warme, it is better to haue a Ram with∣out hornes, because the horned beast being not ignorant what weapons he beareth on his head, is apter to fight then the polde sheepe, and also more luxurious among the Ewes, for he will not endure a riuall or companion-husbande, although his owne strength and nature cannot couer them all: but the pold Ram on the otherside is not ignorrnt how na∣ked and bare and vnarmd is his head, and therefore like a true coward, sleepeth in a whole skin, being nothing so harmful to his coriuals, nor to the females, but well indureth part∣nership in the worke of generation. There is no beast in the world that somuch participateth with the nature of the sunne as the Ram, for from the autumnall Equinoctium vnto the Vernall, Albertus The re em∣blance be∣twixt the un and the Ram as the sunn keepeth the right hand of the Hemisphere, so doth the Ram lie vpon his right side; and in the summer season as the sunne keepeth the other hand of the Hemisphere, so doth the Ram lie vp∣pon his other side. And for this cause the Lybians which worshipped Ammon, Macrobius that is the sun, did picture him with a great pair of Rams-horns. Also, although in the heauenly or celestiall sphere or Zodiacke there be nothing first or last, yet the Egyptians haue placed the Ram in the first place, for theyr Astronomers affirme that they haue found out by di∣ligent calculation, that the same day which was the beginning of the worldes light on the face of the earth, then was the signe Aries in the midst of heauen, and because the middle of heauen is at it were the crowne or vpper-most part of the world, therefore the Ramme hath the first and vppermost place, because it is an Equinoctiall signe, Coelius. The signe of the Ram in the Zodiack. making the daies and nightes of equall length, for twice in the yeare doeth the sunne passe thorough that signe, the Ramme sitting as it were iudge and arbiter twice euery yeare, betwixt the daye and night. Ther be poetical fictions how the ram came into the Zodiake, for some say, that when Bac∣chus led his army through the deserts of Lybia, wherein they were all ready to perish for water, there appeared to him a goodly ram, who shewed him a most beautifull and plen∣tifull fountain which releeued and preserued them al; Poetical ficti¦ons & ridles. afterward Bacchus in remembrance of that good turn erected a Temple to Iupiter, Ammonius also in that place for so quench¦ing their thirst, placed there his Image with Rammes hornes, and translated that ramme into the zodiacke among the starres, that when the Sunne should passe through that sign, all the creatures of the world should be fresh, green and liuely, for the same cause that he had deliuered him and his host from perishing by thirst, and made him the Captaine of all the residue of the signes, for that he was an able and wise leader of souldiors. Other againe tell the tale somewhat different, for they say, at what time Bacchus ruled Egipt, there came to him one Ammon, a great rich man in Affrica, giuing to Bacchus great store of wealth and cattell to procure fauour vnto him, and that he might be reckoned an inuen∣ter of some things: for requitall whereof Bacchus gaue him the land of Thebes in Egypt to keepe his sheepe and cattell, and afterward for that inuention, he was pictured with rams hornes on his heade, for remembrance that he brought the first sheepe into Egypt, and Bacchus also placed the signe of the ram in heauen: These and such like fictions there are about all the signes of heauen, but the truer obseruation and reason wee haue shewed be∣fore out of the Egyptians learning, and therefore I will cease from any farther prosecuti∣on of these fables. Dydimus Aristotle They ought to be two yeare old at least before you suffer them to ioyne in copulation with the Ewes, & for two moneths before to bee seperat and fed more plentifully then at other times, that so at their returne they may more eagerly and perfectly fill the Ews: and then also before copulation, & at the time that they are permitted in some Contries they giue them barly, and mixe Onions with their meat, and feede them with the hearbe Salo∣mons seale, for all these are vertuous to stirre vp and increase their nature. And likewise one kind of the Satyrium and salt water, as we haue said in the discourse afore going. Now, at the time of their copulation they haue a peculiar voice to draw and allure their females, differing from the common bleating, wherof the poet speaketh. Bloterat hinca∣ries, & pia balat ouis: This beast may continue in copulation, and be preserued for the ge∣neration of lambes till he be eight yeare olde, and it is their nature the elder they bee, to seeke out for their fellowes the elder Ewes or females, forsaking the younger by a kind of naturall wisedome. Now concerning the time of their admission to copulation, althogh we haue touched it in the former Treatise, yet we must adde somewhat more in this place. In some places they suffer them in April, The best tim of copulatiō. & some in Iune, that so they may be past daun∣ger before winter, and be brought forth in the Autumne when the grasse after haruest is sweet, but the best is in Octob for then the winter wil be ouerpassed before the lamb com¦forth of his dams belly. Great is the rage of these beasts at their copulation, for they fight irefuly til one of them haue the victory, & for this cause Arrietare among the writers is a word to expresse singular violence, as may apeare by these verses: Arietat in portas & du∣ros obijce postes, Their rage in Ramming ime. and Siluis of Dioxippus, Arietat in primos obijcit{que} immania membra. And so Seneca in his booke of Anger. Magno imperatori aretequamacies inter se arietarent, cox exi∣luit : and indeed great is the violence of rams, for it is reported that many times in Rhatia to try their violence, they hold betwixt the fighting of rams a sticke or bat of Corne-tree, which in a bout or two they vtterly diminish and bruse in peeces. There is a knowne fable in Abstenius of the wolfe that found a coople of rammes, and told them that he must haue one of them to his dinner, and bad hem agree betwixt themselues, to whose lot that death should happen, for one of them must die, the two rams agreede togither, that the wolfe should stand in the middle of the close, and that they twain should part one into one cor∣ner, and the other into the other corner of the field, and so com running to the wolfe, & he that came last should loose his life to the wolues mercy▪ the wolfe agreed to this their deuice, and chose his standing, while the rams consented with their hornes, when they came vpon him to make him sure inough from hurting any more sheepe: forth therfore went the rams, each of them vnto his quarter, one into the East, and the other into the west, the wol e standing ioyfully in the midst, laughing at the rams destruction, then be∣gan the two rams to set forward with all their violence, one of them so attending and ob∣seruing the other, as that they might both meet togither vpon the wolfe, and so they did with vengeance to their enimy, for hauing him betwixt their horns, they crushed his ribs in pieces, and he fel down without stomack to rams flesh. This inuention (althogh it haue another morrall, yet it is material to be inserted in this place to shew the violence of rams, and from this came so many warlike inuentions called Arietes, wherwithal they push down the wals of citties, Martial and warlike inuē¦tions called Rammes as the Readers may see in Vitruuius, Valturnis and Ammianus, for they say that the warlike ram was made of wood, & couered ouer with shels of Torteyses, to the intent it should not be burned when it was set to a wall, and it was also couered with the skins of sacke-cloath by rowes artificially contriued, within the same was a beame which was pointed with a crooked yron, and therefore called a ram, or rather because the front was so hard that it ouerthrew wals, when by the violent strength of men it was forced vp∣on them, and wheras it was shaped ouer with Tortoise shels, it was for the true resemblāce it bare therewith, for like as a Torteise doth sometime put forth his head, and again som∣time pull it in, so also doth the ram sometime put forth the sickle, and sometime pul it in, and hide it within the frame, so that by this engine they did not ouerturn the wals, but al∣so they caused the stones to flie vpon the enimies liue thunder-bolts, striking them downe on euery side, and wounding with their fal or stroke like the blowes of an armed man; and against these forces there were counter-forces deuised on the part of the besieged, for be∣cause the greatnes thereof was such as it could not be moued without singular note and o∣stentation, it gaue the besieged time to oppose against it their instruments of war for their safegard, such were called Culcitrae, Laquei, Lupi ferrum, made like a paire of tongs, wher∣by as Polyaenus writeth, many times it came to passe, that when the wall was ouerthrowne the enimies durst not enter, saying: Cerle hostes sponte ab obsessis destructa moenia metu∣entes ingredi in vrbem non audebant. And thus much for the force of rams both their true and naturall strength, and also their artificial imitation by men. Now on the otherside the wise shepheards want not deuises to restraine the wrath of these impetious beasts. For E∣picharmus the Syracusan saith, if ther be a hole bored in the backer part of his crooked horn neer his eare, it is very profitable to be followed, for seeing that he is captaine of the flock, and that hee leadeth all the residue, it is most necessary that his health and safeguarde be principally regarded, and therefore the auncient shepheards were woont to appoint the captaine of the flocke from the prime and first appearance of his hornes, and to giue him his name, whereof he tooke knowledge and would leade and goe before them at the ap∣pointment and direction of his keeper. When he is angry he beateth the ground with his foot, and they were woont to hange aboord of a foote broad, wherein were drouen many sharp nailes with the points toward the head, so that when the beaste did offer to fight, with his owne force he woundeth his forehead. They were wont also to hange a shrimpe at the horne of the ram, and then the Wolfe will neuer set vpon their flockes. Morral vses of ramshorns Aelianus And concerning their hornes which are the Noblest parts of their body most regar∣ded, yet I must speake more, for there was wont to be euery yeare amonge the Indians a fight betwixt men, wilde beasts, bulles, and tame rams: and a murtherer in auncient time was wont to be put to death by a ram, for by art the beast was so instructed, neuer to leaue him till he had dashed out his braines. It is reported of a rams hornes consecrated at Delos, Plutarch. broght from the coasts of the red sea, that weighed twenty and six poundes, being two cubits, and eight fingers in length. There was a ram in the flocks of Pericles, that had but one horn, wherupon when Lampon the poet had looked, he saied: Ex duabas quae in vrbe vigerent factionibus, fore vt altera ob∣scurata ad vnum periclem, apud quem visum foret portentum resideret ciuitatis potentia, Coelius That whereas there were two contrary-raging-factions in the citty, it should happen that Peri∣cles from whose possessions that monster came, shuld obscure the one, and take the whole gouernment of the citty. Cardan It is reported by Rasis and Albertus, that if the hornes of a ram bee buried in the earth, they will turne into the hearbe sperrage, for rottennesse and putrification is the mother of many creatures and hearbes. There was as Aristotle reporteth in his wonders, a childe borne with a rams head: and it is affirmed by Ouid, that Medea inclosed an old decrepite ramme in a brazen vessell, with certaine kinde of medicines, and afterwards at the ope∣ning of the saide vessell, she receiued a young lambe, bred vpon the metamorphosis of his body. Concerning Phrixus, whereof wee haue spoken in the former part of our discourse of the sheepe, there is this story. He was the he sonne of Athaman, and Nepheles: Afterward his mother being dead, he feared the treachery of his mother in law, and step-dame Inus, The story of Phrixus and the ram with a golden fleece. Apollonius. and therefore with his sister Helle, by the consent of their father, he swam ouer a narrowe arme of the sea vpon the backe of a ram, carrying a golden fleece, which before that time his father had bestowed vpon him. His sister Helle being terrified with the great roaring of the Water, fell off from the rams back into the sea, and thereof came the name of Hellesponte, of Helle the Virgin, and Pontus the sea, but he came safely to Colchis to king Hetes, where, by the voice of a Ram who spake like a man, hee was commaunded to offer and dedicate him to Iupiter, surna∣med Phryxus, and also that golden eece was hanged up and reserued in the Temple of Colchis, vntill Iason by the helpe of Medea aforesaid, did fetch it away, and the ram was pla∣ced among the stars in his true shape, and was called Phrixeus, of Phrixus, who was the father of the Phrygian Nation. Of this fabulous tale, there are many explications and coniecturall tales among the ler∣ned, not vnprofitable to bee rehearsed in this place. Coelias and Palaphatus say, that the ram was a ship, whose badge was a ram, prouided by Athaman for his sonne to saile into Phrygia : and some say, that Aries was the name of a man that was his foster-father, Hermol us. by whose counsell and charge he was deliuered from the step-mother Inus. Other say, that there was a booke of parchment made of a rams skin, containing the perfect way to make golde, called Alchymye, and that thereby Phrixus got away. But in Athens there was reserued the ymage of this Phrixus, Apollonius Gyraldus. The fleece of Colchis offering the ram (vpon which hee was borne ouer the Sea) to the God Laphystius : and whereas there are in Colchis certaine riuers out of which there is gold growing, and oftentimes founde, whereuppon some of them haue receiued their name, as Chrysorrhoa, and the men of that country sayed to bee greatly inriched thereby, Tzetzes. they gaue occasion of al the poeticall fictions about the golden fleece. There are in some places of Affricke certaine sheepe, whose wooll hath the co∣lour of gold, and it may be, that from this occasion came the talke of golden fleeces. It is said that when Atreus raigned in Pelopomesus, hee vowed to Diana the best whatsoeuer should be brought foorth in his flocke, and it fortuned that there was yeaned a golden lambe, and therefore he neglecting his vow did not offer it, but shut it vp in his chest. Af∣terward when he gloried and boasted of that matter, his brother Thrystes greatly enuied him, and counterfetting loue to his wife Aerope, receiued from her the golden lambe. Then being in possession thereof, he contradicted Atreus before the people, affirming that he that had the golden Lambe ought to be king, and to raigne among them, and so layed a wager of the whole gouernment or kingdome thereof with Atreus, whereunto he yeelded, but Iupiter by Mercury discouered the fraud, and so Thyestes took him to flight and the lambe was commaunded to bee offered to the sunne, and so I conclude this dis∣course with the verses of Martiall : Mollia Phryxei secuisticolla mariti Hoc meruit tunicam qui tibi saepe dedit. And seeing that I haue entered into the discourse of these poeticall fables, or rather Rid∣dles which seeme to bee outwardly cloathed with impossibilities, Transmuta∣tion of rams. I trust that the Reader will giue mee leaue a little to prosecute other Narrations, as that Neptune transforming himselfe into a ram, deceiued and deflowred the Virgin Bisabpis, and the auncients when they swore in iest and merriment were wont to sweare by a Ram or a Goose. When the Gyants waged warre with the Goddes, all of the Gods (as the poets write) took vnto them seuerall formes, and Iupiter the forme of a ram, whereof Ouid writeth, he was called Iupi∣ter Ammonius: Vnde recuruis Nunc quo{que} formatis lybis est cum cornibus Ammon. There be some that say that at what time Hercules desired very earnestly to see Iupiter, whereunto he was very vnwilling, yet hee cut off a rams heade, and pulled off his thicke-woolly-rough-skinne, Herodotus and put it vppon him, and so in that likenes appeared to Hercules, and for this cause the Thebanes to this day doe not kill rams, but spare them like sanctified thinges, except one once in a yeare, which they sacrifice to Iupiter, and say, that Iupiter was called Ammonius aries, because that his answeres were misticall, secret and crooked, like a rams horne. Strabo. Sacrificing of Rams amōg the Gentiles Now concerning the sacrificing of rams, we know that God himselfe in his word, per∣mitted the same to the people of the Iewes, and therefore it cannot bee but materiall for vs to adde something also to the discourse before recited in the story of the sheepe. The gentiles when they sacrificed a ram, they roasted his intrals vpon a spitte or broach, and there were certaine daies of sacrifice called Dies Agonales, wherein the principal ram of e∣uery flocke after combate or fighting was slaine and sacrificed for the safegard of the resi∣due to Ianius, and others by the king: Ita rex placare sacrorum Numina lunigerae coniuge debet Ouis. There was at Tanagrum a statue of Mercury, carrying a ram (and therefore he is called Kro∣phoros Hermes, and by that name was worshipped of all the Tanagreans. Now there was a cunning workeman of Calamis that made that statue, for they say, that when the Citty was greeuously afflicted with a pestilence, Mercury by carrying a ram about the wals, de∣liuered the same, and therefore they did not onely procure that statue for Mercury, but also ordained that euery yeare one of their most beautifull young men shoulde carry a sheep on his shoulder round about the wals. In Ianuary they sacrificed to Iupiter a ram, and in February a Weather. Gyraldus. Pliny writeth a strange Riddle which is this. Cinnamomum in Aethiopia gignitur, ne{que} metitur nisi permiserit deus. There is Cinamon growing in Ethi¦opia, and yet it is not reaped by men, except the God thereof gaue permission or leaue, wherby some vnderstand Iupiter whom they called Sabin, and the Latins Assabinus. Now Pliny saith, Pliny. that if they had sacrificed forty and foure Oxen, Bucke-goats and rams, with their intrals, they purchased leaue to gather that Cinnamon. When the Romans obserued their Soli-Taurilia, they sacrificed a Bul, a Goat, a ramme, and a Bore, but vnto Iupiter they held it not lawfull to offer a ram. Vlysses offered to Nep∣tune a Ram, a Bull and a Boare, and to conclude this discourse of the rams sacrifices, I finde a story worthy the noting, recorded by Paulus Venetus, although it bee altogether superstitious and full of humane blindnesse and error. There is a Citty of Tartary called Sachion, the inhabitants whereof are Mahometanes and ydolaters, as soone as any of them haue a sonne borne, hee presently commendeth him to one ydols tuytion and protection or other: and that year together with his young sonne he nourisheth a ram tamed in his owne house: at the yeares end, he offereth his son and the ram at the next festiuall day of that ydoll which he hath chosen, that is, he presen∣teth his childe and killeth his ram, with great solemnity and ceremony in the presence of all his kindred, friends, neighbors, and acquaintance, and maketh earnest request to that ydoll to protect his sonne, and to guide and gouerne him all the time of his life, and ther∣fore he hangeth vp the flesh of that ram in his presence, and afterwarde they take away a∣gaine the same flesh and carry it to another priuate flesh, wherewith the said father and al the kindered assembled do make a great and rich feast, reseruing the bones for religions sake: And thus we see how miserable men beguiled with error, do not onely make shew of false religion, but also play the Hippocrites in that which is erroneous, thinking it an easie thing to deceiue Almighty God. Concerning other thinges of rams, they concurre with that which is said already of sheepe in generall, except their medicinall partes, which I will reserue to the due place: And heerein adde one thing more of the hornes of the Rhaetian rams, and in some places of Italy, namely, that after they be fiue, six, or seuen year old, they bring forth vnder their great hornes two other little hornes, and that these rams are weake of body, and haue but rough and course wooll. In other places if at any time they chaunce to beare mo hornes then two, tis pro∣digious and vnnaturall. And thus much of the Ram. Of the Weather-sheepe. A Lthough this beast haue all things in common with the ram aforesaid, for he is a male-sheepe, and in nature differeth not from him, but only by the Art of man, I might very wel haue confounded and conioyned his story with the praecedent: but seeing that al Nations do distinguish him from the ram, because of one property or defect in him, for that hee is not fit for generation, I wil follow the streame, and not striue a∣gainst my Authors, nor swarue from their method. There∣fore in latin it is cald Veruex quasi versa natura, for that his na∣tural seed is changd & turnd in him, for his stones are taken away, and so he remaineth libbed and gelded, being an Eunuch among beasts. The Grae∣cians call him Krion Tomian, that is, a gelded ram, for they haue not one word to expresse him. The Latins do also cal him Sectarius, and Festus rendreth this reason thereof, Quia e∣um sequantum agni, because the little lambs loue his company and follow him: and indeed by reason of his vnaptnesse to generation, the Ewes forsake his company, and the rams cannot endure him, therefore instead of other he associateth himselfe with the lambes. In some parts of Germany they call him Frischling, and also Hammel, which word seemeth to be deriued from the Arabian word Lesan Alhamell, a rams tonge. The Italians cal him Castrone, Custrato, and Montone, the French Mouton, and the Illyrians Beram. Concerning the gelding of rams or making of Weathers, I haue not much more to say, then that which is already expressed in the generall tractate of the sheep, and for the manner I do refer the Reader, not onely to that part, but also to the discourse of the calfe and Oxe, wherein I trust he shall finde satisfaction for this point, whether he will do it by a knife, by reed, by finger, or by hammer, for all those waies are indifferently proponed. The best time for the gelding of rams, ought to be in the waine or decrease of the moone at fiue months old, so as he may neither be troubled with extreamity of cold or heat. And if it be not libbed at that age, but prolonged till two, three, or foure yeare old, wee haue shewed already the English manner for knitting of rams. Being thus libbed or knit, their hornes grow not so great as the other males vngelded, but their flesh, and lard, or sewet is more acceptable then of any other sheep whatsoeuer, except they be ouer old, for that it is neither so moist as a lambs, nor yet so rank as a rams or Ewes, where Baptiste Fiera made these verses: Anniculus placeat, vel si sine testibus agnus, Pinginox est hordo quin calet olla vores. Hunc anno se duriper pascua montis anhelat. Maluero, si auri villere diues erit. Platina also writeth thus of the flesh of Weathers, Veruecem caro satis salubris est & melior quam agnina, calida enim & humida habetur, ad temperamentum tendeus, illa vero plus humi∣ditatis quam caliditatis habet, That is to say: The flesh of Weathers is wholsome ynough, and better then the flesh of Lambes, because it is hot and moist, but that hath in it more moisture then heat, and therefore this tendeth to a better temperament. Munster writeth, that the inhabitants and people of Valuis take this flesh of Weathers and salt it, afterward dry it in the ayre where no smoake may come vnto it; afterward they lay it vp in strawe, and so hold it much more delicate then that which is raized in the smoake. As the flesh of these beastes groweth the better for their gelding, because they liue more quietly and peaceably, for that their fore-heades grow weake and tender, and their horns smal, so also it is reported that their tailes grow exceeding large and fat. In some Regions, as in Arabia Foelix, and other places, and because the report should not seeme feined by me, I will describe it in the Authours owne words, Paulus Venetus writeth thus of the Weathers of Scythia, and in the region Camandu, subiect to the great Tartar. In Tar∣tariae regione Camandu vrietes non minores asinis sunt, cauda tam longu & latu vt triginta librarum pondus aequent. In Camandu a territory of Tartaria there are Rams like Asses, in stature and quantity, whose tailes are so long and broad, that they ballance in waight thir∣ty pound. Vartoman writeth. In adibus regis Arabium fuisse praepingus veruecem, cutus cauda adeo obesa fuit vt libras quadraginta appenderet, & propi Reame vrbem Arabiae foelicis, verue∣cum genera reperiuntur, quorum caudam animaduerti pondo esse librarum quadragintu quatu∣or, carent cornibus, adeo{que} esse obesi & pingues vt vix incedere possunt. Circa Zeclam vrbem Aethiopiae verueces non nulli ponderasissimas trahunt caudas, vt pote pondo sedecim librarum. His caput & collum nigricant, caeteris albi sunt. Sunt etiam verueces prorsus albicantes, quo∣rum cauda cubitatis est longitudinis modo eluboratae vitis, palearia vt bubus à mento pendent, quae humum prope verrunt. That is to say, In the house of the King of Arabia, there was a Weather very fat, whose taile waighed forty pound, and neare vnto Reamia, a Citty in Arabia Foelix, there are a breed or race of Weathers, whose tailes for the most part wai∣ed foure and forty pound. They want hornes, and are so fat that they can scarcely go. Al∣so about the Citty Zecla in Aethiopia, the Weathers draw long tailes, waighing sixteene pound. Whereof some haue their heads and necke blacke, and all the other parts of their body white, some of them againe al white, hauing a taile but of a cubit long like a curious and planted Vine, their crestes and haire hanging from their chinne to the grounde. Thus farre of the Arabian Weathers. Of the Indians hee writeth thus in another place. Circa Tanasuri vrbem Indiae tanta est pecudum copia vt duodeni veruices singulo aureo vaene∣unt. Conspiciuntur illic verueces alij, cornua haud ab similia daemis habentes, nostris longe ma∣iores ferocioresque. Candae veruecem in perigrinis regionibus tantae sunt, quantus nullus apud nos veruex. Contingit hoc quia hutindissimum hoc animal, & inter quadrupedia frigidissimum eum{que} coetera essa vetendi nequeant, ne pinguedine immensa, extensis etiam assibus & neruis non parum, quae humida natura velut pisces semper incremento apta sunt. That is, About the cit∣ty Tarnasar in India there is such great plenty of cattell, that they sell twelue Weathers for a noble, and yet there are Weathers which haue hornes like to the hornes of Deere, being longer, greater, and fiercer then our Rams, and their tailes in forraign and strange countries are fatter then any Weathers among vs; and the reason hereof is, because it is the moistest and coldest creature among al foure-footed-beastes: and bycause the bones cannot be enlarged to receiue that moysture, and least that it should destroy the beast by exuperance and aboundance, therefore nature hath prouided this remedy to sende it forth into the taile, whereby in flesh and fat it groweth exceedingly, the bones and nerues whereof are not a little extended, for they are also of a moist nature like fishes, and there∣fore apt to encrease and grow immeasurably. Thus much say they of the tailes of Weathers, now I know such is the solidity of diuers Readers & people, that for these reports, they wil presently giue both these Authors and me the Whet-stone for rare vntruths and fictions; I do not maruaile, for such (I dare as∣sure my selfe) doe not beleeue all the miracles of Christ, hauing shorte and shallow con∣ceiptes, measuring all things by their owne eies, and because they themselues are apt to lye for their profit, therefore they are not ashamed to lay like imputations vppon honest men, yet I could shew vnto them as great or greater wonders in our owne nation (if they were worthy to bee confuted,) for which other nations account vs as great liers (nay as these infidell fooles) do them and yet they are common among vs. The vse of the seuerall parts of this beast, is no other then that which is already repor∣ted of the sheep and Ram, and therefore I will not stand to repeate that which is so lately related, and for the remedies or medicinal vertues, I fynd few that are special except those which are common between this and other of his kind. It seemeth by Plautus that a Wea∣thersheepe is accounted the most foolish of all other, a coward and without courage, for speaking of a mad dotish fellow he writeth thus: Ego ex hac statua veruecea, volo erogitare, meo minore quod sit factum filio. That is, I will demaund of this blockish weathers picture, (meaning his foolish seruant) what is become of my younger son. These were among the Pagans sacrifyced, but not among the Iewes, for they haue not so much as a name for it, & it is probable that seeing it is an vnperfect beast, God forbade it to his sanctuary: when the gentiles brought a Lamb at the side of a Weather to be sacrifi∣ced, they called them Ambegni, and so also a Lamb and an Oxe. Alciatus maketh this pret∣ty emblem of a Weather which with a Hedghog is the armes of Millaine, wherewithall I will conclude this discourse; Festus Bituricis veruex, Heduis dat sucula signum. Ais populis patriae debita origo meae est. Quam Mediolanum sacram dixere puellae Terram: nam vetus hoc Gallica lingua sonat. Culta minerua fuit, nunc est vbi numine Tecla Mutato matris virginis ante domum. Laniger huic signum sus est, animal{que} biforme. Acribus hinc setis, lanitio inde leui. OF THE LAMBE. T He Lambe is diuersly tearmed by the Haebrewes, as is al∣ready shewed in the story of the sheep, The seuerall names (in some part) and now more particularly, Seh signifieth a Lambe, Keseb and Kebes a Lambe of a yeare old, also Gedi, according to the opinion of Dauid Kimhi, in Greeke Arniou, and Arna, and Amnos, and at this day Arni, the Italians Agna, Agno, Ag∣nello, the Spaniards Cordero, the French Agueau, and Ag∣nelet, the Germans Lamb and Lamblein, and as the first year we call it in English a Lamb, so the second year a hog Lam-hog, or Teg if it be a female, the third yeare Hog∣grils and Theaues; the Latins call it Agnus, of the Greeke word Agnos, castus quia est hostia pura & immolationi apta. That is, chast for that a Lambe is pure and cleane, and fit for sacrificing. And the common epithits expressing the nature of this beast are these, rough yearling, weake, vnripe, sucking, tender, butting, fat, milke-eater, merry, sporting, bleating, affa∣ble or gentle, field-wanderer, horne-bearer, horne-fighter, vnarmed, vulgar, wooll-skin∣ned, wooll-bearer, wanton, meeke, delicate, and fearefull: and all these are the epithets of a male Lamb, but of the female I find these following; dumb, snow-white, neate, young, fearefull, blacke, tame, humble, and tender, and the Graecians Heàypnous, because of the sweet smell that is found in them when they are young and sucke their dams. Aristotle We read that the Lambs of Affrick, both males and females are yeaned with horns, the reason whereof is shewed in another place, Aelianus and it is common and natural thing to them all as soone as they are fallen out of their dams belly, they presently leape and run about their dams, Of the meek disposition of Lambes. and also learne to know them by whom they are nourished, according to the saying of Lucretius : Praetrea teneri tremulis vocibus hoedi, Corniferas norunt matres, agni{que} petulci. S. Ambrose writeth thus of the inclination of a Lambe to his mother, and the loue of her milke. Agnus simplicissimus ouium recognoscit vocem parentis, cum amatre quando{que} oberrat, frequenter eam balatu excitat multis{que} licet versetur in millibus ouium & festinat ad eam nam quamuis cibi & pontus desiderio tenetur transcurrit tamen aliena vbera, licet humore lactis gra∣uida exundent soluis{que} materni lactis fontes requirit. The Lambe is a most simple beast, and erreth many times from his mothers sides, hauing no other meanes to prouoke his mo∣ther to seeke him out but by bleating, for in the middest of a thousand sheep it discerneth the voice of his parent, and so hasteneth to her when it heareth her; for such is the nature of this poore beast, that although there bee many other Ewes which giue sucke, yet they passe by al their vdders to tast of their mothers fountains, & the Ewe knoweth yer young one by smelling to the backer part: the lamb al the while it sucketh waggeth & plaieth with the tail. When the lamb is newly falen, for a day or two in some countries they put them vp close into a stable for a day or two or three, till they grow stronge, and are well filled with Milke and know their dammes, and so long as the Rams feede with the females they keepe in the Lambes, that so they may bee cleare day and night from all violence of the Rammes, for at night they lodge single and alone by their dams sides. The like regard is to be had if they doe not sucke their mothers, they must annoint their lips with butter or Hogges-grease and milke, and for two monthes after their yeaning it is not good to rob them of any milke, but suffer them to sucke all that their dammes can breede, Dydimus for so their Lambes will grow more stronge, and also their Wooll more fine. And when they are to be weaned they must first of all bee brought out of loue of their mothers milke, least after their separation they languish, and loose all naturall ioy, whereby they are ne∣uer likely to come to good: afterward let them be hearded or droue to fielde, Varro but after their yeaning it is profitable when they are a weeke olde to giue them salt, and so the se∣cond time after they be fifteene daies old. It is neuer good to nourish the firstling or first Lamb of an Ewe, for that commonly they are weaker and more tender then any other, but the best to be nourished are twins. They are also the best and strongest which are bred in the spring time, and much fatter, and more able then those which are yeaned in the Autumne. And yet there are some that affirme, that they which are bred in the Winter are fatter then those which are bred in the Summer, for if strength of nature bee able to liue out the Winter at the first yea∣ning, much more will they be able to endure when they are elder, Pliny in the first sucking of a Lamb, the beestinges must be milked out, for they are apt to fal into many diseases, such as are already mentioned in the discourse of the Sheepe, generally to preserue them in health, they giue them Iuy when they are vexed with an Ague, & separate them from the Ewes, least by sucking they infect their mothers, then must they bee milked alone, Democritus and their milke mixed with raine Water, and so giuen to the sicke Lambe, and if they wil not take it willingly, then infuse it into her throate with a horne, and if they bee troubled with scabs, take Hysope and salt, of each an equall quantity, and if the mouth bee broken out and blistered, then rub the aflicted place therewith, afterward wash them with vineger, and then annoint them with liquid Pitch and hogs grease; there must also be a care had to keepe them from Lice. Concerning the vse of their seueral parts, we haue already shewed in the story of sheep, and therefore we neeede not prosecute it in this place. Their skins are fitter to cloth men, then the skins of their dams, and therefore the Haebrewes say that they are fittest for the garments of young men, for they encrease their strength and naturall vigor. The skin∣ners make great account of these Lambes-skinnes, and vse them for the lyninges of many garments, such as are killed they call the skins of slaughter-Lambs. The best are brought out of Italy and Apulia, and al those parts which are beyond Rome. Narbon, and Spaine yeald plentiful store of black Lambs, and their skins are sold by Marchants: and white skins are plentifull in England. Their flesh is nourishable and conuenient for foode, but yet inferior to weather mut∣ton, for that it containeth more moysture then heate. To conclude this discourse of the Lambe, the greatest honour thereof is for that it pleased God to call his blessed Son our Sauiour by the name of a Lamb in the old Testament, a Lambe for sacrifice▪ & in the new Testament, styled by Iohn Baptist, the Lambe of God that taketh away the sinnes of the world. There is a prouerb in Greek, Arneia soi lelaleken agnus tibi locutus est. A Lamb hath spoken this vnto you, and it was a prouerbiall speech to expresse a diuine reuelation of some businesse, that men cannot attaine vnto by ordinary and common meanes, because either it is concealed, or else it concerneth thinges to come. For it is reported by Suidas that once in Egypt there was a Lambe that spake with a mans voice, vppon the Crowne of his head was a regall Serpent hauing Winges, which was foure cubits long, and this Lambe spake of diuers future euents. The like is said of another Lamb that spake with a mans voice, at what time Romulus and Remus were borne; and from these miraculous euents, came that common prouerb: and so for this story I will conclude with the verse of Valerius: Aspena nunc pauidos contra ruit agna leones. There is in Moscouia nere volga, a certaine beast of the quantity and forme of a little Lamb, the people call it Boranz, and it is reported by Sigismundus in his descripti∣on of Moscouia, that it is generated out of the earth like a reptile creature, without seede, with dam without copulation, thus liueth a litle while and neuer stirreth far from the place it is bred in, I mean it is not able to moue it selfe, but eateth vp al the grasse & green things that it can reach, and when it can find no more, then it dyeth. OF THE MVSMON. I Haue thought good to reserue this beast to this place, for that it is a kind of sheepe, and therefore of natural right and linage belongeth to this story, for it is not vnlike a sheepe except in the wooll which may rather seeme to be the haire of a Goate; Pliny. and this is the same which the auncients did cal Vmbricae oues, Vmbriam sheepe, for that howsoeuer in haire it diffreth from sheepe, yet in simplicity and other inward giftes it commeth nearer to the sheepe. Strabo calleth it Musmo, yet the Latines call it Mussimon. This beast by Cato is cald an Asse, and som∣times a Ram, and sometimes a Musmon. The picture which heere wee haue expressed, is taken from the sight of the beast at Caen in Normandy, and was afterward figured by The∣odorus Beza. Munster in his description of Sardinia remembreth this beast (but he saith) that it is speckled, whereat I do not much wonder, seeing that he confesseth that he hath al that he wrote thereof, by the Narration of others. Some say it is a horse or a mule, of which race there are 2. kinds in Spaine, called by the Latines Astuxcones, for they are very small; but I do not wonder thereat, seeing that those little horses or Mules are called Musimones, because they are brought out of those Coun∣tries where the true Musmones (which we may interpret Wilde sheepe or wilde goats are bred and norished.) There are of these Musmons in Sardinia, Spaine, and Corsica, and they are said to be gotten betwixt a Ram and a goat, as the Cinirus betwixt a Buck-goat, and an Ewe. The forme of this beast is much like a Ram, sauing that his brest is more rough and hairy: his hornes do grow from his heade like vulgar Rams, but bend backward onely to his eares: they are exceeding swift of foot, so as in their celerity they are comparable to the swiftest beast. The people of those countries wherein they are bred, do vse their skins for brest-plates. Pliny maketh mention of a beast which he called Ophion, and he saith hee found the remembrance of it in the Graecian books, but he thinketh that in his time there was none of them to be founde in the worlde: heerein he speaketh like a man that did not knowe GOD, for it is not to be thought, that hee which created so many kindes of beasts at the beginning, and conserued of euery kind two, male and female at the generall deluge, would not afterward permit them to be destroyed till the worldes end, nor then neither: for seeing it is apparant by holy scriptures, that after the world ended, al Crea∣tures and beasts shall remain vpon the earth, as the monuments of the first six daies works of Almighty God, for the farther manifestation of his glory, wisedome, and goodnes, it is an vnreasonable thing to imagine that any of them shall perish in general in this world. The Tardinians call these beasts Mufflo, and Erim Mufflo, which may easily bee deriued from Ophion, therefore I cannot but consent vnto them, that the auncient Ophion is the Musmon, being in quantity betwixt a Hart and a sheepe, or Goate, in haire resembling a Hart, & this beast at this day is not found but in Sardinia. It frequenteth the steepest moun¦taines, and therefore liueth on greene grasse and such other hearbes. The flesh thereof is very good for meat, and for that cause the inhabitantes seeke after it to take it. Hector Boethius in his description of the Hebredian Islandes saith, that there is a Beast not much vnlike to a sheep, but his hair betwixt a goats and a sheeps, being very wild & neuer found or taken but by hunting, and diligent inquisition. The name of the Island is Hiethae, and the reason of that name is from this breed of sheep called Hierth in the Vulgar toong, yet those sheep agree with the Musmon in al things but their tails, for he saith, that they haue long tailes reaching downe to the ground, and this name commeth from the Germaine word Herd a flocke, and thereof Hirt commeth for all sheepe in generall. Now followeth the conclusion of their story with there medicinall Vertues. The medicines of the Sheepe in generall. The bodies of such as are beaten, and haue vpon them the appearance of the stripes, being put into the warme skins of sheepe when they are newly puld off from their backs, Galen. eateth away the outward paine and appearance, if it continue on a day and a night. If you seeth togither a good season the skin of the feet, and of the snowt of an Oxe or a sheep till they be made like glow, and then taken forth of the pot and dried in the windie aire, is by Siluius commended against the burstnes of the belly. The blood of sheepe drunke, is profitable against the falling sicknesse: Also Hippocrates prescribeth this medicine following, for a remedy or purgation to the belly, Plinie first make a perfume of Barly steeped in oyle vpon some coles, and then seeth some mutton or sheeps flesh very much, and with decoction of Barley set it abroade all day and night, and after∣wa d seeth it againe and eat or sup it vp warm, and then the next day with hony, Frankin∣cense, and Parsely, all beaaen and mingled togither, make a suppository, and with wooll ut it vp vnder the party, and it shall ease the distresse. The same flesh burned and mix∣ in water by washing, cureth all the maladies or diseases arising in the secrets, and the roath of Mutton, Goose, or Veale, wil help against the poison by biting if it be not drawn t by cupping glasse nor by horse-leach. The sewet of a sheepe melted at the fire, and with a linnen cloath annointed vpon a burned place, doth greatly ease the paine thereof. The liuer with the suet and Nitre causeth the scars of the flesh to become of the same co∣ ur that it was before the wound, it being mixed with toasted salt, scattereth the bunches in the flesh, and with the dust of womens haire, cureth fellons in the fingers, or any parte of the bodies. The sewet of sheepe or goats, being mingled with the iuice of rennish wine grape and shining horse-flies, doeth without all scruple or doubt, ease the paine of the bee annointed the upon. The f of sheepe doeth very easily expel the rough∣nes of t e ailes.

The Vrine of Sheepe is very profitable against the Hydropsie being mixed with Honny. But Rasis saith otherwise, which is, Albertus that the dung being drunke with Honny is auaileable against the Dropsie. To take the weight of a penny of Oxe dung and Sheepes dung, and a graine of Myrrh, and two ounces and a halfe of Wine, doth stay or resist the comming of the Kings euil.

Vnwasht wooll doth cure all the diseases in the priuy parts of men or women being aplyed thereunto. The blacke Wooll of Sheepe, is very profitable for all swellings in the stones or Cods of men. The gall of Buls put vpon vnwashed Wooll, is very profitable for the flowers of women: Vnwashed wooll being applyed vnto those parts that are dead, doth very much good vn∣to them.

Dioscorides doth also affirme that Sheepes Wooll being vnwashed is curable for all kinds of wounds whatsoeuer. The same is very much applyed vnto those whose bones are bruised or broken, if it bee mixed with the braines of wanton Dogge, Serenus and bound hard vpon the grieued place in a linnen cloth. The Carthagenian Sheapheards doe vse the vnwashed Wooll of Lambes of the age of foure yeares, for the curing of the Temples, or the crowne of the head.

Vnwashed Wooll being taken in some certaine perfume doth cure those which are Frantike, and restore them to their former wits. Spleene-wort being boyled in Hony and mixed with vnwashed wool which was steeped in Oyle or Wine, is very good for the aforenamed disease being bound about the forepart of the head in a broad linnen cloath. Sheeps wooll being also applyed in the same manner, is an excellent cure for those which are troubled with a certaine watery rheume or running in the eies, as also the ache in the forepart of the head. Galen Vnwashed wooll boyled in Vineger and applyed vnto the eares, doth expell all filth or moysture therein, and the issue thereof being afterwardes stopped with the same kinde of wooll, is very speedily cured. Sheepes wooll is also very good and effectuall for the curing the paines of the eares which are but new comming vpon them. Vnwashed wooll being mixed with Oyle of Roses and put into the Nostrils of any man, the eares being stopped close with the same kind of wooll, will stay the yssuing of the bloud at the Nose, how fluent soeuer it be. The same being also steeped in Oyle and put in the Nose, doth restraine the bleeding thereof. Wooll being plucked or wrested from the backe of Sheep, and kept vnwashed, doth cohibite the aboundance of blood, being steeped in pure liquid Oyle of Roses.

Vnwashed wooll being applyed vnto the secret parts of women, doth cause a dead child to come forth. The same doth also stay the issues of women. The pure or cleare fleeces of sheep either applyed by themselues, or min∣gled with Brimstone, do cure al hidden or secret griefes whatsoeuer: and Pliny commen∣deth them aboue al other medicines whatsoeuer. Fleeces of wool mingled with quicksiluer, Serenus are very profitable to be taken for the same diseases in certaine perfumes. The roote of a Mallow being digged vp before the rysing of the sun, and wrapped in vndyed wooll, doth cure the Wens or mattry impostumes of those sheepe which haue lately brought forth young. Sheepes wooll being died in purple colour, doth very much profit the eares: Pliny but some do steep it in vineger and Nitre, to make the operation more effectuall. The dust of wool being burnt, doth bring forth the matter or corruption lying hid vnder scabs, restraine the swellings in the flesh, and bringeth all vlcers to a chop of scar. Wooll being burnt hath a sharp force, and likewise hot together with the slendernes of the parts, it doth therefore very speedie clense and purge the sores in the flesh, which are moist and to much full of matter. It is also put in drying medicines. It is burned as if there were ma∣ny other things in it, filling a new pot, which may be couered with a couer which is bored through with many holes like vnto a siue. The powder of vnwashed wooll is anointed vp∣on diuers sores, and is very curable for them as bruised, new wounded, & sores halfe burnt, Galen and it is vsed for the curing of the diseases in the eies, as also for the healing of the fistulaes and corrupt and mattery sores in the eares. The power of the powder of vnwashed wool is clensing, and it doth very effectually purge the eye-lides or cheeke-bals. It doth also clense and cure for the most part all diseases, as Serenus saith in these verses; Succida cum tepido nectetur lana Lyaeo, Ambust aeue ciuis complebit vulneris ora, Aut tu succosae cinerem perducito lanae. The haires which grow about the secret hole of sheep being burned, beaten and drunke in sweet wine, doth help the shortnesse of the breath, and ease the pursines of the stomacke. The wooll of a little sheep being pulled from betwixt his thighes and burnt, & afterwards dipped in vineger, doth very speedily cure those which are troubled with the head-ach, being bound about the temples. The dust of sheepes fleeces is very medicinable for the curing of all diseases in the genitall parts whatsoeuer. The dust of sheeps wooll, Marcellus doth heale all passions in cattell. The Graecian plaister (called Encapharmacum ) consisted of nine seue∣ral things, and amongst the rest of vnwashed wooll. The filth which sticketh to the sheeps wool & groweth therunto, from which the thing which the Graecians cal Oesypon is made, hath the force of digestion like vnto butter, and also alike ability of concoction. In a cer∣taine medicine of Andromachus, for the curing of the disease of the secret parts, vnwashed wool is added to the rest: but Lepas (as Galen saith) for vnwashed wool doeth adde goose greace in the same quantity. Some do also for vnwashed wool vse the marrow of a young calfe, and apply it in the aforesaid manner; but this vnwashed wooll is termed of the Grae∣tians Aesypus, and therefore being by diuers Authors set downe diuersly concerning the making and vertue thereof, I haue thought good to set downe the truest and excellentest way to make the same (as Dioscorides ) whom in this I suppose best to follow reporteth. First to take new shorne wooll which is very soft, and not trimmed with sope-weed, and wash it with hot water, then to presse al the filth forth of the same, and cast it into a cauldron which hath a broad lip, and afterwards to poure the water in, and to stir it vp and down with a cer∣taine instrument with such great force as it may foame againe, or with a wooden rod still greatly to turne and trouble it, so that the filthy froath or spume may more largely be ga∣thered together, afterwards to sprinkle it ouer with sea water, and the fat remaining which did swim vpon the top, being gathered togither in an earthen vessel, to poure the water in∣to the cauldron: then must the froath be poured againe into the sea water, & lastly taken out again, this is so often to be done that the fat being consumed, there wil not any froath be left remaining, the Aesypus then being gathered togither, is to be mollified with mens hands, & if there be any filth therin, it must out of hand be taken away, and all the water by little and little excluded, and being fresh poured in, let it be mingled with ones hands, vn∣till the Aesypus being touched with the tongue of any one, may lightly bind it, but not sauor either sharp or tartly, and the fat may seeme very white, and then let it be hid in an earthen vessell, but let there be great care had that they be done in the hot sun. But there are some which vse another manner of way to make the same which is this, to clense the fleeces, and wash away all filth, and presse it forth of the same, and boile them in water o∣uer a soft fire in a brazen vessel, then to wash the fat which swimmeth on the top being ga∣thered together with Water, and being strained in another platter which may haue some hot water in it to hide or ouercast it with a linnen cloth, and lay it forth in the sun vntil it be very white and thick enough. Some also do vse another way, as this, to wash the fat being strained with cold water, and to rub it with their hands, not much otherwise then women doe a seare-cloth, for by that meanes it is made more white and purer. There is yet another kind of way to make Aesy∣pus, described by Aetius in these words, take (saith he) the greasie wooll which groweth in the shoulder pits of sheepe, and wash them in hot water, being thick and soft, and squize al the filth forth of the same, the washing wherof you shall put in a vessell of a large mouth or brim, casting afterwards hot water in the same, then take the water in a cup, or in some other such like instrument, and poure it in and out, holding it vp very high vntill there come a froath vpon it, then sprinkle it ouer with sea water, if you shall get any, if not, with some other cold water, and suffer it to stand still, when it shall waxe cold take that which shall flow on the top away with a ladle, and cast it into any other vessell, afterwards hauing put a little cold water in it, stir it vp and downe with your handes, then hauing poured out that water, put new hot water in it, and repeate againe the same thing altogether, which we haue now taught, vntill the Aesypus be made white and fat, containing no impute or filthy thing in it at al, then dry it in the sun, being hid for some certain daies in an earthen vessell, and keepe it. But all these things are to be done when the sun is very hot, for by that meanes it will be more effectual and whiter, and not hard or sharp. There are moreouer some which gather it after this manner. They put new shorne wooll which is very filthy and greasie in a vessel which hath hot water in it, and burne the water that it may somewhat wax hot, afterwards they coole it, and that which swimmeth aboue in the manner of fat, they scum it off with their handes, and put it away in a vessell of Tinne, and so do fill the vessell it selfe with raine water, & put it in the sun couered with a thin linnen cloth, and then we must moysten it a∣gain, and put vp the Aesypus, for it hath strength mollifieng and releasing with some sharp∣nes, but it is counterfeited with wax, sewet, and Rozen, and it is straight waies perceiued & for as much as the true Aesypus reserueth the scent of the vnwashed wooll, and being rub∣bed with any ones hands is made like vnto Ceruse, or white lead. Euen the filth and sweat of sheep, cleauing to their wooll, hath great and manifold vse in the world, and aboue all other that is most commended which is bred vpon the Athenian or Graetian sheep, which is made many waies, and especially this way: first they take off the wooll from those places where it groweth, with all the sewet or filth there gathered together, and so put them in a brasen vessel ouer a gentle fire wher they boile out the sweat, & so take of that which swim∣meth at the top, and put it into an earthen vessel, seething againe the first matter, which fat is washed together in cold water, so dryed in a linnen cloth is scorched in the sun vntill it become white and transparent, and so it is put vp in a box of tinne. It may be proued by this, if it smell like the sauour of sweat, and being rubbed in a wet hand doe not melt, but waxe white like white lead, this is most profitable against al inflammation of the eies, and knots in cheeks, or hardnesse of skin in them. Of this Aesypus or vnwashed wooll the Grae∣tians make great account, and for the variety of dressing or preparing it, they cal it diuersly, somtime they call it Oesupum Pharmaicon, sometime Oesupon Keroten, Oesupon Kerotoeide, sometime Oesupon Hugron, and such like. Of it they make plaisters to asswage the Hypochon∣driall inflammations and ventosity in the sides: Some vse Aesopus for Oesypus : but ignorant∣ly, and without reason, it is better to let it alone, but in the collection heereof it must be ta∣ken from the sound & not from the scabby sheep▪ But when we cannot come by the true Oesypus, then in stead thereof we may take that which the Apothecaries and ointment-ma∣kers do ordaine; namely, Meliloti: vnc: 4. Cardamomi vnc. 2. Hysopiherb. vnc. 2. with the vnwashed wooll taken frō the hams or flanks of a sheep. Myrepsus vseth this Oesipus against all gouts and aches in the legs or articles, and hardnesse of the spleene. Galen calleth it Ius Lanae, and prescribeth the vse of it in this sort. Make (saith he) a playster of Oesypus or ius lanae in this sort, take waxe, fresh-greace, Scammonie, old oile, one ounce of each, of Fen∣ny-greeke sixe ounces, then seeth or boile your oile with the ius lanae, and Fenny-greeke very carefully, vntill it equall the oyle, and bee well incorporated together, and then againe set it to the fire vntill with the perscription aforesaide, and also he teacheth how to make this Ius lanae, for (saith he) take vnwashed wooll and lay it deepe in faire water vntill it be very soft, that is by the space of sixe daies, and the seuenth day take it and the water together, that seeth wel, taking off the fat which ariseth at the top, and put it vp as is afore∣said: these things saith Galen. The vse of this by reason it is very hot, is to display vlcers and tumors in wounds, Dioscorides espe∣cially in the secrets and seat, being mixed with Melitote and butter, and it hath the same vertue against running sores. The same also with barly meale and rust of iron, equally mixed together, is profitable against al swelling tumors, Carbuncles, Tetters, Serpigoes, and such like, it eateth away al proud flesh in the brims of vlcers, reducing the same to a na∣turall habit and equality, also filling vp the sore and healing it, and the same vertue is by Dioscorides attributed to wooll burnt, also in bruses vpon the head when the skinne is not broken, a poutesse made hereof, is said by Galen to haue excellent force and vertue. The same mingled with roses, and the oare of brasse (cald Nil,) cureth the holy fire, and being receiued with Myrrh steeped in two cups of wine, it encreaseth or procureth sleepe, and also is very profitable against the falling sicknes. And being mixed with Corsuke Hony, it taketh away the spots in the face, because it is most sharp and subtile, wherunto some adde butter, but if they be whealed and filled with matter, then prick and open them with a nee∣dle and rub them ouer with a dogs gall or a calfes gall mingled with the said Oesypus, Marcellus also being instilled into the head with oyle, it cureth the megrim, and furthermore it is vsed against all sorenesse of the eies, and scabs in their corners, or vpon the eye-lids, being sod in a new shell, and the same vertue is attributed to the smoke or soote thereof, if the eye-browes or eye-lids be annointed herewith mixed with Myrrhe and warmed, it is thought that it will restore the haire that is wanting and fallen off: but Marcellus prescribeth it in this manner, you must take Oesypus or sweat of sheep from vnder the wooll of their shoulders, and adding vnto it a like quantity of Myrrhe, beate them together in a morter, and with a warme cloth annoint the bare places. If there be any bruse in the eies, then you must annoynt them first with Goose-grease, and the blood of a Mallard, and afterward with the sweate of a sheep, and the same cureth al vlcers in the mouth, eares, and genitals, with Goose-greace. This is also mixed with a seare-cloth, and laid against the Pthists (as Aetius writeth) with a moyst cloth against the the pleurusie, also a plaister hereof made with Goose greace, butter, Allum, and the brain of a Goose, is very profitable against the paines in the raines, and all other infirmities of the backe, and for the same cause it is applyed to women, for it prouoketh their mouthly courses, and also causeth an easie deliuerance in child-birth, it healeth the vlcers in the se∣cret and priuy parts of men and women, and al inflammation in the seate, especially being mixed with butter, Goose-greace, and Melitote: and some adde thereunto the oare of brasse and Roses. If there be a Carbuncle in the priuy parts, Plinius take this Oesypus with Honny and the froath of lead, also white lead, womens milke, and this sheepes sewet, cureth the gout, at the least maruailously asswageth the pain therof, & some physitians for this euill take greace, goose-greace, and the fat of Buls, adde to Oesypus, also vnwashed wooll with the gall of a Bull laid to a womans secrets, helpeth her monthly purgation, and Olimpias added therunto Nitre. The dung which cleaueth to sheeps tailes made into small bals, and so dryed, afterward beat into powder & rubbed vpon the teeth, although they be loose, fal∣ling out, or ouergrown with flesh, yet Pliny saith they wil be recouered by that fricassing. If he which is sick of a dropsie drink this sweat or Oesypus in wine with Mirrh of the quanti∣ty of a hasel nut, goose greace, & Mirtle oile, it wil giue him great ease, and the same vertue is ascribed to the sweat of an Ewes vdder, vvhich is and hath bin said of al the former Oesi∣pus. The medicines of the Ram. Euen as the skins of other sheep newly plucked from their backs and applyed warm, do take away the ach swelling, and paines of stripes and blowes from bodies, so also haue the skins of rams, the same property. Arnoldus commendeth a plaister made of a rams skin for burstning and falling downe of the guts, and this is found ready prepared in many Apothecaries shops, and the happy successe therof is much commended by Alysius. If a man take the stones of a fighting cocke, and anoint them with Goose grease, and so weare them in a peece of a rams skin, it is certaine that it will cohibite and restraine the rage of venerial lust, and a woman wearing about her the right stone of dunghill cocke, in a rams skin, shall not suffer abortement. The washed fleece of a ram wet in cold oile, putryfieth the inflammation of the secrets, and likewise the blacke wooll of a ram wet in water, and then in oyle, and so put to the sicke places, keepeth the fundament from falling, and also asswageth the paine. Also the wooll of a fighting ram taken from betwixt his hornes, and perfumed into a smoke, easeth the pain, and some take the powder thereof in vineger for that Malady. The say that Lais and Salpe cure the bitings of mad dogs, and also Tertian & quartan Agues, with the menstruous purgation take in a peece of rams wooll, and inclu∣ded in a bracelet of siluer. Also they write that a woman shall haue an easie treuaile if shee weare in the wool of a ram, seede of wild Cucumber about her loines, not knowing therof, so as it be presētly after the deliuery cast out of doores. Also Marcellus saith, that if one take the wool from a rams forehead, and burne in the couer of a new pot, and afterward beat it to powder in a morter, and so put into vineger, and therewithal the forehead being anoin∣ted, it easeth the head-ach Also the dust of rams wooll mixed with water, cureth the paine in the yard. The matter of the liuer sod, hath the same operation: & Sextus writeth, that if the wooll be taken from the head, ribs, and cods, and also worne by him that hath a ter∣tian ague, it perfectly cureth him, and if a mans fingers ends and toes be tyed with the vnwashed wooll of a ram, it will stanch the bleeding at any part, especially the Nose. Al∣so if you burne the greasie wooll of a very fat ram, and in water wash the same, it will help all euils in the yard of a man, if it be rubbed therewithall. The broath of the rumpe of a ram is commended against blisters. The flesh of a ram be∣ing burnt and annointed vpon the body of any leprous person, Auicenna or any whose body is trou∣bled with ring-wormes or itches, is very effectuall to cure them. The same force hath it against the bites of Scorpions, and stingings of Serpentes, and Algerarat: it also being taken in wine, good for the bitinges of mad dogs, and healeth the white skins in the eies. The fat of a sheep or Weather hath the same in it, as Porke-greace, and cureth the suffo∣cation of the womb, and all other diseases incident vnto the secret parts, and also helpeth places in the body being burnt by fire. The fat of a ram being mingled with red Arsenicke and annointed vppon any scaull or scab, the same being afterward pared or scraped, doth perfectly heale it. It doth also being mixed with Allum, helpe those which are troubled with kibes or chilblanes in their heeles. The sewet of a ram mingled with the powder of a pumise stone and salt, of each a like quantity, Sextus is said to heale fellons and inflammations in the body. The lunges of smal cattel, but especially of a ram, doth restore chaps or scarts in the body to their right collour. The same vertue hath the fat of a ram being mingled with Nitre. The gal of a ram mingled with his own sewet, Marcellus is very good and profitable for those to vse who are troubled with the gout or swelling in the ioynts. The horne of a ram being burned and the dust of the same mixed with oyle, and so pounded together, being often anointed vpon a shauen head, doth cause the haire to frisle and curle. A comb being made of the left horn of a ram, and com∣bed vpon the head, doth take away all paine vpon the left part thereof, if likewise there be paine in the right side of the head, the right horne of a ram doth cure it. For the curing of the losse of one wits springing from the imperfection of the braine, take the head of a ram neuer giuen to venery, being chopped off at one blow, the hornes being onely taken away and seeth it whole with the skin and the wooll in water, then hauing opened it, take out the braines, and adde vnto them these kinds of spices, Cinamon, Ginger, Mace, and Cloues, of each one, halfe an ounce: these being beaten to powder, mingle them with the braines in an earthen platter diligently tempering of them by a burning cole, not very big, for feare of burning, which might easily be done, but there must great care be had that it be not too much dryed, but that it might be so boyled that it be no more dryed then a calfes braines being prepared for meate. It shall be sufficiently boiled when you shall wel mingle them at the fire, then keep it hid, and for three daies giue it daiely to the sick person fasting, so that he may abstain from meat and drinke two houres after. It may be taken in bread, or in an Egge, or in whatso∣euer the sicke party hath a desire vnto: but there must be regard that he be not in a cleare place, and that hee vse this forty daies space, which they are wont to vse whose blould is with drawne or fled away: and let him abstaine from wine assayng his head. There are those which are holpen in a short space, some in sixe or eight weekes by this Medicine being receiued. But it is conuenient that it be required for three months, Marcellus and then it will haue the more power therein. The lunges of a Ramme while they are hot applyed vnto woundes wherein the flesh doeth to much encrease, doth both represse and make it equal. The lungs of smal cattel, but especially of Rams being cut in smal pieces & applyed whiles they are hot vnto bruised places, do very speedily cure them and reduce them to the right collour. The same doth cure the feete of such as are pinched through the straightnesse of their shooes. The lunges of a Ram applyed vnto kibed heeles or broken vlcers in the feet, doth quite expell away the paine, notwithstanding the exceeding a chor pricking thereof. One drop of the liquor which is boyled out of a Rams lungs put vpon the small nailes vpon the hand, doth quite expell them. The like operation hath it to expell Wartes being annoin∣ted thereupon. The corrupt bloud of the lungs of a Ram vnroasted, doth hele all paines in the priuy members of man or woman, as also expell warts in any place of the body. Sextus The iuyce of the lungs of a ram while they are roasted vpon a Gridiron being receiued, doth by the vnction thereof purge and driue away the little blacke warts which are wont to grow in the haire or priuy parts of any man. The liquor which distilleth from the lunges of a ram being boiled, Aesculapius doth heale Tertian Agues, and the disease of the raines which grow therein. The lungs of a Lamb or ram be∣ing burned, and the dust thereof mingled with oile, or being applyed raw, doe heale the sorenesse of kibes, and are accounted very profitable to be bound vnto vlcers. The lungs of a ram being pulled forth and bound hot vnto the head of any one that is frenzy, wil pre∣sently help him. Against the pestilent disease of sheepe: take the belly of a ram and boile it in wine, then being mixed with Water, giue it to the sheepe to drinke, and it wil bring present remedy. The gall of a ram is very good for the healing of those which are trou∣bled with any pains in the eares, comming by the casualty of cold. The gal of a ram ming∣led with his owne sewet, doth ease those which are troubled with the gout. The gall of a Weather mingled with the wool and placed vpon the nauell of young children, Marcellus doth make them loose in their bellies. The stones of an old ram being beaten in halfe a penny waight of water, or in 3. quarters of a pint of Asses milk, are reported to be very profitable for those which are troubled with the falling sicknesse. The stones of a ram being drunke in water to the waight of three halfe pence, cureth the same disease. The dust of the inward parts of a rams thighs being lapped in rags or clouts, washed very exactly before with womens milk, doth heale the vlcers or runnings of old sores. Pliny The dust of the hoofe of a ram mingled with hony, doth heale the bitings of a Shrew. The dung of Weathers mingled with vineger and fashioned in the forme of a plaister, doth expel black spots in the body, and taketh away al hard bunches arising in the flesh. The same being applyed in the like manner, cureth S. Anthonies fire, and healeth burned places. The fil h or sweat which groweth between the thighs of a ram being mingled with Mirrhe and the Hearbe called Hart-wort, and drunke of each an equal parte, is accounted a very excellent remedy for those which are troubled with the Kings euill. Sextus But Pliny commen∣deth the filth of rams eares mingled with Myrrhe, to be a more effectuall and speedily re∣medy against the said disease. The medicines of the Lamb. The best remedy for bitings of Serpents is this, presently after the wound to applie some little creatures to the same, Aetius. being cut in small peeces, and laid hot vnto it, as cocks, Goats, Lambes, and young pigges: for they expell the poison and much ease the paines thereof. An ounce of Lambes blood being fresh before that it doth congeale mixed with Vineger, and drunke for three daies together, is an excellent remedy against the vomit∣ting or spetting of blood. The like force in it hath the blood of a Kidde. The bloode of a Lambe mingled with wine, doth heale those which are troubled with the falling sicknesse, as also those which haue the fowle euill. For the conception of a Woman, take the yarde and gall of a Bucke, a Kid, and a Hare, with the blood and sewet of a Lamb, and the mar∣row of a Hart, and mix them altogither with Nard and oyle of Roses, and after her purga∣tion, Pliny. let them be laied vnder her, and this without all doubt wil make her apt to conceiue. The skins of Serpents being annointed with water in a bath, and mingled with lime and Lambes sewet, doth heale the disease called S. Anthonies fire. The marrow of a Lambe melted by the fire, with the oyle of Nuts and white sugar, distilled vpon a cleane dish or platter, and so drunke, doth dissolue the stone in the bladder, and is very profitable for a∣ny that pisseth blood. It also cureth al paines or griefes of the yarde, bladder, or reynes. The skin of a Lambe being dawbed or annointed with liquid-pitch, and applyed hot vnto the belly of any one that is troubled with excoriations of the bowels or the bloody flix wil very speedily cure him, if he haue any sence or feeling of cold in him. If a Virgins men∣strual fluxes come not forth at the due time, Hippocrates. and her belly is moued, it is conuenient to ap∣ply lambs skins being hot vnto her belly and they will in short space cause them to come forth. A garment made of lamb skins is accounted very good for the corroborating and strengthning of yong men. The skins of lambes are more hot then kids skins, & are more profitable for the confirming of the backe and the reines. The little bone which is in the right side of a Toad being bound in a young lambes skin being hot, doth heal both quar∣taine and al other feauers being aplied thereunto. The dust of lambs bones is very much and rightly vsed for Vlcers which haue no chops or stars in them. The dust of smal cattels dung being mingled with Nitre, but especially of lambs, hath in them great force to heal cankers: the dust of lambs bones, is very much commended for the healing and making of greene wounds sound and solide, which thing by the Saracens is much verified in regard that at al times they go to war, Marcellus Pliny. they neuer forget to take of the same along with them. The lungs of lambs do very effectually cure those whose feete are wrung or pinched by theyr shoo-soles. The lungs of lambs or rams being burned, and the dust thereof mingled with oile, is very profitable for the curing of kibes or vlcers, being applied thereunto. It hath the same vertue being raw & bound vpon the sore. Marcellus The runnet of a lambe is of very great force against al other euil medicines. The runnets of smal cattel but especially of a lamb, is very effectual against al kinds of poyson. The runnets of a kid, a lambe, and a hind-calfe are conueniently taken against Wolfe-bane drunke in wine. The runnet of a hare, a kid, or a lambe taken in wine to the weight of a dram is very effectuall against the forke-fish, & cureth the bites or strokes of al Sea-fishes. The runnet of a lamb drunk in wine is an excel∣lent cure for the bitings of a shrew. Pliny. The runnet of a lamb drunk in water is accounted for a safegard to young children who are vexed with thicke and concrete milke: or if the de∣fault shal happen by curded milke it wil be soone remedyed by a lambes runnets giuen in Vineger. A Lambs runnet hid or poured into water, doth speedily cohibit the bleeding of the nose, when nothing else can stay it. The gal of smal Cattel but especially of a Lamb be∣ing mixed with hony, are thoght to be very medicinable for the curing of the falling sick∣nes. The places which are infected by cankers, being anointed ouer with the gal of a lamb are very speedily and effectually healed. There is also by the Magicians deliuered vnto vs a speedy means for the curing of the melt, which is this, to take a Lamb new born, & instantly to pluck him in pieces with ones hands, Marcellus. and when the melt is pulled out to put it hot vpon the melt of the party so grieued, and bind it on fast with swadling cloathes, and continually to say, I make a remedy for the melt: then in the last day the same being taken from his body to put it to the Wall of the be wherein the diseased party is wont to lye, it being first daubed with durt, that it might the better stick, and to signe the durt with seuen and twenty markes, saying at euery mark, I make a remedy for the melt, this remedy being done three times it will heale the disea∣sed party although he be very weake and full of danger. But this is the opinion of the Ma∣gicians, which I here set downe that they should rather see their folly then beleeue, know∣ing them to be meere fopperies. For making the wool to grow slower, the gelders of cat∣tel anoint the bloud which commeth from the stones of gelded Lambes, which being anointed, doth profit very much for haires being pulled away, as also against poison. Pliny The dung of Lambes before they haue tasted of any grasse, being dryed in the shaddow, and rubbed to powder and applyed in the manner of a plaister, doth heale and ease al kindes of paines in the chaps or iawes. And thus much for the medicines of the sheepe. OF THE STREPSICEROS. T Here is in Creete neare the Mountaine Ida, Bellonius a kind of sheep called by the Sheapheardes Strepsiceros, which is not dif∣ferent from the vulgar sheep, except onely in the hornes, for they bend not like other, but stand straight and vpright like the Vnicorne, and beside are circled about with certain round speeres like a Goates horne: This liueth in flockes, and we haue here beside the figure of the beast, expressed a double form of their hornes, and forepart of their head, the figure of a Harpe being fastened to one of them as it was presently drawen. The description whereof was taken by Docter Cay of England, in these words following. The hornes of this Strepsiceros are so liuely expressed by Pliny, and so fitly fitted to beare Harpes, that they seeme not to aske any further narration of words. I will therefore onely adde this, they are hollow within, and long, about two Roman feet and three palmes if you measure them, as they are straight; but if you take their scantling and length as they crooke a little, then are they about three foot long, they are in breadth where they ioyne to the head, three Roman fingers and a halfe, and their whole compasse in that place is about two Roman palmes and a halfe. In the top they are smooth and blacke, but at the root they are more dusky and rugged, growing lesser and lesser to a sharp point. They with the dryed face did waigh seuen pounds and three ounces, and the face which remaineth is ioyned to the hornes, and likewise the haire of the necke and face. It is said that this beast is as great as a Hart, hauing a red haire like a Hart. But whether his nostrils were so also I could not coniecture, by reason that the age and long vse of the piece had defaced the nose which was dried vp, and also the haire was worne away, so as it was bald, but by that which was most apparant vnto it. I rather inclined that it resembled a Hart, from hence it was that the drawer made the nostrils lesse then might answere the proportion of the face, and that which is seene betwixt the hornes it is a piece of the necke, by which relation I canot beleeue that the Cretican or Idean sheep is a Strep∣siceros because the hornes thereof do not bend at all, although it answreth not the name, but the true hornes of the Strepsiceros do as I haue said resemble the auncient fashion of harpes, among our fore-fathers, especially the handle being taken away, and the face of the beast placed instead thereof. Vnto this I may adde an∣other horn, which is to be seene in the Castle of the L. William Wernhere count of Cimbria, being blacke, hollow, and of the length of ones arme, and as thicke as a great staffe, and it was said that the beast beareth two of them, which are to bee seene amonge the rare monuments of Ferdinandus the Emperor. OF THE SQVIRRELL. T He name of this beast is by the Graecians called Sciuros, & it was giuen them from the fashion & proportion of theyr taile, which couereth almost the whole body, for that which is fabulously saide of the Sciapodes to haue seete that couer their whole body, is more truely verified of a Squir∣rels taile, for in the day time being out of her nest, she hi∣deth her selfe there vnder both from sunne and raine. The first Author that euer wrote of this beast was Oppi∣anus, who liued in the daies of Antoninus Caesar, and the Latines haue no proper or natiue name for it, but borrow from the Graecians, although some of the later writers cal it Pirolus, and Spiurus, I thinke they would say Sciurus, for so it is vulgarly termed in La∣tine: some also call it Sculurus a currendo, because of his nimble running vppon boughes, But all the nations of the world deriue their seuerall denominations from the Graecians, as the English Squirrell from Sciurus is not farre fetched, the French words Escurieu, and Escureau, from whom the Germans borrow their words Eychorn, or Eichorn, or Eych horn, or ich hermlin, that a weasill of the tree, and Das Eychorn. The Italians call it Schiriuolo, and the Venetians (as Massarius testifieth Schiriati, the Spaniards Harda, & Esquilo, and some do interpret Coma dreia for a Squirrel: The Illyri∣ans Weweeka, and some of the Polonians Wije Wijerka, and so they turne the mouse Varius as we haue said else-wherein that story, and some of the Germans call it Werck, and Veeh, and Fech. Now Albertus and Agricola say, that there is no difference betwixt the mouse Varius and the Squirrel, but onely in the region which altreth the colour, and therefore we haue expressed the same figure thereof, remitting the Reader to that which is said in that histo∣ry, for this (say they) in Germany is red after it be a yeare old, but before the time it is blackish, that is till it be a yeare old: In Polonia it is of a red-ash-colour, or branded gry∣sell, in Russia of an ordinary ash colour, and for the quantity, food, and maner, or natural inclination, it hath the same in all parts with the mouse Varius. Varinus and Hesychius say, that the Graecians call this beast also Campsiouros, and Hip∣pouros, and some call the Cappadocian mouse Neexis a Squirrell; the Iewes at this daye call a Squirrell Coach, for it is apparant that in auncient time til they came into these parts of the world into Graecia and Europe, they neuer knew or saw this beast. And this shall suffice to haue said of the name. A Squirrel is greater in compasse then a Weasil, but a Weasil is longer then a squir∣rel, the backe parts and all the body is red, except the belly which is white. In Heluetia they are blacke and branded, and they are hunted in the Autumne at the fal of the leafe, when the Trees growe naked, for they run and leape from bough to bough in a most admirable and agile manner, and when the leaues, are on, they cannot bee so wel discerned. They are of three colours, in the first age blacke, in the second of a rusty yron colour, and last of al when they be striken in age, they are ful of white hoare haires. Their teeth are like the teeth of mice, hauing the two vnder teeth very long and sharpe, their taile is alway as big as their body, and it lyeth continually vpon their backe, when they sleepe or sit still: It seemeth to be giuen them for a couering as we haue said already. The maw-gut differeth from al other, for it is Coecum, that is, as I take it without a passage out of it into any other part then the other guts, or like a mans bladder, and it is as great as their ventricle, which in dissection hath bin found ful stuft with excrements. The genital is like a bone, as Vesali∣us writeth. They vse their forefeet instead of hands, for they sit vppon their buttockes, and mooue their meat to their mouth with them, in this point resembling euery little vulgar mouse, yet being put to the mouth, they hold it in their teeth. They wil eat Nuts and Almondes very greedily, and also Apples, Buckmasts, Acornes, and sometimes hearbes, especially Lettuce, and al other sweet fruits. Their feet are clouen like mice, and their hinder parts very fleshy to sit vpon. In the summer time they build them nests, (which in our countrey are called Drayes ) in the tops of the Trees, very artificially of stickes and mosse, and such other things as woods to affoord them. The mouth of their nest is variable, sometimes at the sides, and sometimes at the top, but most commonly it is shut against the winde, and therefore I thinke that shee maketh many passages, stopping and opening them as the winde turneth. In summer time they gather togither aboundance of fruits and Nuttes for winter, euen so much as their little Dray will holde and containe, which they carrie in their mouthes, and they lodge manie times two togither, a male and a female (as I suppose.) They sleep a great part of the win∣ter like the Alpine mouse, and very soundely, for I haue seene when no noise of hunters could awake them with al their cries, beating their nests on the outside, and shootinge boltes & arrowes thorough it, vntil it were pulled assunder, wherein many times they are found killed before they be awaked. They are of incredible agility and motion, neuer standing stil as it appeareth by them which are tamed. When they leape from tree to tree, they vse their taile instead of wings, which is most apparant, because many times they leap a great distance and are supported without sinking to mans appearance. And againe I haue seene them leape from the toppe of very high trees downe to the grounde in such an ordinary pace as Birdes flie from Trees to light on the earth, and re∣ceiue no harme at al: for when they are hunted, men must goe to it with multitude, for many men cannot take one with bowes and bolts with Dogges, and except they start and rouze them in little and smal slender woods, such as a man may shake with his hands they are seldome taken. Bowes are requisite to remoue them when they rest in the twistes of trees, for they will not be much terrified with al the hollowing, except now and then they bee struck by one meanes or other. Wel do they know what harbour a high oake is vnto them, and how se∣cure they can lodge therein from men and Dogges, therefore seeing it were too troble∣some to climbe euerie tree, they must supply that businesse or labor with bows and bolts, that when the Squirrel resteth, presently shee may feele the blow of a cunning Archer, he neede not feare doing her much harme except he hit her on the head, for by reason of a strong backe-bone and fleshy parts, she will abide as great a stroake as a Dogge; yea, I haue seene one remoued from a bough with a shot to the ground. If they be driuen to the ground from the trees to creepe into hedges, it is a token of their wearinesse, for such is the stately mind of this little Beast, that while her limbes and strength lasteth, she tarrieth & saueth her self in the tops of tal trees, then being discen∣ded, she falleth into the mouth of euery curre, and this is the vse of Dogges in their hun∣ting. The admirable witte of this beast appeareth in her swimming or passing ouer the Wa∣ters, for when hunger or some conuenient prey of meat constraineth her to passe ouer a riuer, shee seeketh out some rinde or smal barke of a Tree which shee setteth vppon the Water, and then goeth into it, and holding vppe her taile like a saile, letteth the winde driue her to the other side, and this is witnessed by Olaus Magnus in his description of Scandinauia, where this is ordinary among Squirrelles, by reason of many riuers, that o∣therwise they cannot passeouer, also they carry meate in their mouth to preuent famine whatsoeuer befall them, and as Peacockes couer themselues with their tailes in hot Sum∣mer from the rage of the sunne, as vnder a shaddow, with the same disposition doth the Squirrell couer her body against heate and cold. They growe exceeding tame and familiar to men if they be accustomed and taken when they are young, for they runne vp to mens shoulders, and they will oftentimes it vpon their handes, creepe into their pockets for Nuttes, goe out of doores, and returne home againe, but if they be taken aliue, being olde, when once they get loose, they will neuer returne home againe, and therefore such may wel bee called Semiferi rather then Cicures. They are very harmeful, and wll eat al manner of woollen garments, and if it were not for that discommodity, they were sweete-sportful-beastes, and are very pleasant play-fellowes in a house. It is saide, that if once they tast of Garlicke, they wil neuer after bite any thinge, and this is prescribd by Cardan to tame them, their skins are exceeding warm, & wel regarded by skinners, for their heat is verie agreeable to the bodies of men, and therefore they are mixed also with the skins of Foxes. Their flesh is sweet but not very wholesome except the Squirrel were a blacke one: It is tender and comparable to the flesh of Kids or Conies, andl their tailes are profitable to make brushes of. The medicins are the same for the most part which are before expressed in the Dormous sauing that I may adde that of Archigenes, who writeth that the fat of a Squirrell warmed on a rubbing cloath, and so instilled into the eares, doeth wonderfully cure the paines in the eares. And so I conclude this history of the Squirrell with the Epithets that Martiall maketh of a Peacocke, a Phoenix, and a Squirrel, in a comparison of a bewtifull Virgin Erotion. Cui comparatus indecens erat pauo. Inamabilis sciurus & frequens Phoenix. Of the Getulian Squirrell, described and figured by Doctor Cay. T His Getulian or Barbarian Squirrell, is of mixt colour, as it were betwixt black and red, and from the shoulders all along to the taile by the sides, there are white and russet strakes or lines, which in a decent and and seemely order stand in ranks or orders; and there be some of these Squir∣rels which haue such lines of white and blacke, with cor∣respondent lines in the taile, yet they cannot be seene ex∣cept the taile bee stretched out at length, by reason there is not much haire vpon it. The belly seemeth to be like a blew colour vpon a white ground. It is a little lesse then the vulgar Squirrel, and hath not any eares extant or stan∣ding vp as that, but close pressed to the skin round, and arysing a little in length by the vp∣per face of the skinne. The head is like the head of a Frog, and in other things it is very like the vulgar Squirrell, for both the outward shape, the manner, and behauiour, the meat and means of life agree in both, and she also couereth her body like other Squirrels. This picture and description was taken by him from one of them aliue, which a Marchant of London brought out of Barbary. They are very pleasaunt and tame, and it is very likely that it is a kind of Egyptian or Affrican mouse, whereof there are three sorts described by Herodotus, the first called Bi∣pedes, the second Zegeries, and the third Echines, of which we haue already spoken in the story of diuers kinds of mice, and therefore I will heere end the discourse of this beast. OF A WILDE BEAST IN THE new-found world called Su. THere is a region in the new-found world, called Gi∣gantes, and the inhabi∣tants thereof are called Pantagones ; now becaus their countrey is cold, being far in the South, they cloath themselues with the skins of a beast called in theyr owne toong Su, for by reason that this beast liueth for the most part neere the waters, therefore they cal it by the name of Su which signifieth water. The true image therof as it was taken by The∣uetus, I haue heere in∣serted, for it is of a very deformed shape, and monstrous presence, a great rauener and an vntamable wilde beast When the hunters that desire her skinne set vpon her, she flyeth very swift, carrying her yong ones vpon her back, and couering them with her broad taile: now forsomuch as no Dogge or man dareth to approach neere vnto her, (because such is the wrath therof, that in the pursuit she killeth all that commeth neare hir▪) the hunters digge seuerall pittes or great holes in the earth, which they couer with boughes sticks, and earth, so wealty that if the beast chance at any time to come vpon it, she and her young ones fall down into the pit and are taken. This cruell, vntamable, impatient, violent, rauening, and bloody beast, perceiuing that her naturall strength cannot deliuer her from the wit and policy of men her hunters, (for being inclosed, shee can neuer get out againe,) the hunters being at hande to watch her downfall, and worke her ouerthrow, first of all to saue her young ones from taking & taming, she destroyeth them all with her owne teeth; for there was neuer any of them ta∣ken aliue, and when she seeth the hunters come about her, she roareth, cryeth, bowleth, brayeth, and vttereth such a fearefull, noysome, and terrible clamor, that the men which watch to kill her, are not thereby a little amazed, but at last being animated, because there can be no resistance, they approch, and with their darts and speares wound her to death, and then take off her skin, and leaue the carcasse in the earth. And this is all that I finde re∣corded of this most sauage beast. Of the Subus, a kinde of wilde Water-sheepe. T His beast is called by Oppianus Soubos, and thereof the Latines call it Subus▪ Bo∣dine in his interpretation of Oppianus, doth make it one beast with the Strepsi∣ceros, but because he expresseth no reason thereof, I take it that he was decei∣ued by his coniecture, for we shall manifest, that either the colour or seate of liuing, cannot agree with the Strepsiceros, (for he saith) only it is the same beast which Pliny calleth a Strepsiceros. But we know by the discription of Oppianus, that this beast is of red-gold-colour, ha∣uing two strong armed hornes on the head, and liueth sometimes in the Sea, and water, sometime on the land. Of all kinds of sheepe this is the worst and most harmefull, raue∣ning after life and blood, for it goeth to the water, and therein swimmeth: when the silly simple Fishes see this glorious shape in the waters, admiring the horns, and especially the Golden colour, they gather about it in great flocks and abundance, especially Shrimps, Lobsters, Mackarell, and Tenches, who follow him with singular delight on either side, both the right and the left, pressing who shall come nearest, to touch and haue the fullest sight of him; so they accompany him in rankes for loue of his so strange proportion. But this vnkinde and rauening beast, despising their amity, society, and fellowship, maketh but a bait of his golden outside and colour, to drawe vnto him his conuenient prey, and beguile the innocent fishes, for he snatcheth at the nearest, and deuoureth them, tarying no longer in the Water then his belly is filled, and yet these simple foolish fishes seeing their fellowes deuoured before their faces haue not the power or wit to auoid his deuou∣rers society, but still accompany him and weary him out of the Waters till he can eate no more, neuer hating him, or leauing him, but as men which delight to be hanged in silken halters, or stabbed with siluer and golden Bodkins, so do the fishes by this golden-colo∣red-deuouring-monster. But such impious cruelty is not left vnreuenged in nature, for as she gathreth the fishes together to destroy them, so the fisher men watching that con∣course, do entrappe both it and them, rendering the same measure to the rauener, that it had done to his innocent companions. And thus much shal suffice for the Subus or wa∣ter-sheepe. Of the Swine in generall. B Eing to discourse of this beast, The seuerall names. althogh the kinds of it be not many as is in others, yet because there are some thinges peculiar to the Bore, and therefore he deserueth a speciall story by himselfe, I will first of all deliuer the common properties in a generall Narration, and afterward discend to the speciall. For the names of this beaste, there are many in all languages, and such as belong to the seuerall sex and age of euery one. For as in English we call a young swine a Pigge, A weaning Pigge, a sheate, a Yealke, and so foorth: likewise, a Hogge, a Sow, a Barrow, a Libd-Hog, a libd-Sow, a Splayed Sow, a Gelt Sow, a Basse, for the elder swine, so in other Nations they obserue such like titles. The Haebrewes cal a Bore Chasir, and a Sow Chaserah, the Chaldees Deut. 4. for Chasir translate Chasira, the Arabi∣ans Kaniser the Persians Mar-an-buk, the Septuagints Hus, and S. Hierome, Sus. The Arabi∣ans also vse Hazir, and Acanthil, for a hog, Achira, and Scrofa. The Graecians do also vse Sus or Zus, Choiros, and Suagros. The wilde hog is called Ka∣pro , from hence I coniecture is deriued the Latine word Apex. Silu The Italians do vulgarly call it Porco, and the Florentines peculiarly Ciacco, and also the Italians call a sow with pig Scrofa and Troiata or Porco fattrice. The reason why that they cal a Sow that is great with Pigge Troiata, or Troiaria, is for the similitude with the Troian horse, Alun u . Erythraeus because as that in the belly thereof did include many armed men, so doth a sow in her belly many young pigs, which afterward come to the table and dishes of men. A Barrow hog is called Maia∣lis in Latine, and the Italians Porco castrato, and Lo Maiale. The French call a swine Porceau, a sow Truye Coche, a Bore, Verrat, a pig Cochon Porcelet, and about Lyons, Caion. The bar∣row hog they cal Por-chastre. The Spaniards cal swine Puerco, the Germans saw, or suw, su schwin, schwein, a sow they call Mor and looss, a Bore Aeber, which seemeth to be deriued from Aper, a barrow hog Barg, a splaied sow Gultz, a pig Farle, and Seuwle, and a sucking pig spanfoerle. In little Brittaine they call a hog Houch, and therof they cal a Dolphin Mer∣houch. The Illyrians call Swine Swinye, and Prase. The Latines Sus Porcus, and Porcellus, & Scrofa, and these are the common and most vulgar tearmes of swines: If there be any other they are either deuised or new made, or else deriued from some of these. Concerning the Latine worde Sus, The etimolo¦gy of the Greeke and Latin names. Isidorus deriueth it from Sub, because these beasts tread vnder foote grasse and grayne, and indeede for this cause the Egyptians kept their Swine in the hilles all the yeare long, till their seed time, for when their corne was sowne, they droue them ouer their newe plowed Landes, to tread in the graine, that the Fowls and Birds might not roote it or scrape it forth a∣gaine, & for this cause also they spared Swine from sacrificing. But in mine opinion, it is better deriued from Hus the Greeke word: For the Latine Porcus, is thought to be fetched from por rectus, because his snowte is al∣way stretched forth, and so hee feedeth, digging with it in the earth, and turning vp the roots of trees: but I better approoue the notation of Isidorus, Porcus quasi spurcus quia cano & limo se volutat. That is, because it row∣leth and walloweth in the mire. Porcetra or Porceta for a sow that hath hadde but one farrowe, & Scropha for a sowe that hath had many. The Graecians Hus is de∣riued from Thuein, which signi∣fieth to kil in sacrifice, for great was the vse of sacrificing this beast amonge the Paynims, as we shall shew afterward. The an∣cient Graecians did also tearme swine Sika, and when the Swine herds did cal the beasts to their meates, they cryed Sig, Sig : as in our Countrey their feeders cry Tig, Tig, Choiros of their fee∣ding and nursing their younge ones. And indeede from Swine we finde that many men haue also receiued names, as Scipio Suarius, and Tremellius Scro∣fa, A istory of the amily of . whereuppon lieth this history, as he writeth when Licinus Nerua was Praetor, his great Vncle was left Questor in his absence for Macedonia, vntill the Praetor returned. The ene∣mies thinking that nowe they had gotten opportunity and aduantage against their besie∣gers or assa lants, caused an onset to be made, and a fight to be offered, then his Vnckle exhorting the Romane Souldiors to Armes, tolde them, Se celeretar hostes disiecturum vt sorosa porcellas, That he would as easily cast them off and scatter them, as a sow doth hir pigges sucking her belly, which he performed accordingly, and so obtained a great vic∣tory, for which Nerua was made Emperour, and hee was alwaies euermore afterwarde called Scrofa. Macrobius telleth the occasion of the name of the family of Scrofa somewhat otherwise yet pertaining to this discourse. Tremellius (saith hee) was with his family and children, dwelling in a certaine village, and his seruants seeing a stray Sow come among them, the owner whereof they did not know, presently they slew her, and brought her home. The Neighbour that did owe the Sow called for witnesses of the fact or theft, and came with them to Tremellius, demaunding his Scrofa or Sow againe. Tremellius hauing vnderstood by one of his seruants the deed, layed it vp in his Wiues bed, & couering it ouer with the cloaths, caused her to lye vpon the Sowes carkase, and therefore told his neighbour hee should come in and take the Scrofa, and so had brought him where his wife lay, Coelius Names of men taken from swine. and swore he had no other Sow of his but that, shewing him the bed, and so the poore man was de∣ceiued by a dissembling oth, for which cause (he saith) the name of Scrofa was giuen to that family. There was one Pope Sergius, whose christen and first name was Os porci, Hogges snowt, and therfore he being elected Pope, changed his name into Sergius, which custome of alteration of names, as that was the beginning, so it hath continued euer since that time among all his successours. Likewise we read of Porcellus a Grammarian, of Porcellius, a Poet of Naples, who made a Chronicle of the affaires of Fredericke Duke of Vrbine, Por∣cius, Suillus, Verres the Praetor of Sycilia, Syadra, Sybotas, Hyas, Hyagnis, Gryllus Porcilla, and many such other giue sufficient testimony of the original of their names, to be drawen from Swine, and not onely men, but people and places; as Hyatae, Suales Chorreatae, three names of the Dori in Greece: Hyia a Citty of Locris, Hyamea a Citty of Mesene, Hyamaion a Citty of Troy, Hyampholis a Citty of Phocis ; whereby to all posterity it appeareth, Alex. ab alex that they were Swineheardes at the beginning; Exul Hyantaenos inuenit regna per agros Hy pe, Hyops a Citty in Iberia, Hysia a Citty of Boeotia, and Pliny calleth the tall people of Ethiop, which wer 8. cubits in height Sybotae, and the like I might adde of many places, Cities, peo∣ple, fountaines, Plants, Engins, and deuises, plentifull in many Authors, but I will not trouble the Reader any longer with that, which may be but thought to bee vnnecessary. Onely I cannot containe my selfe from the fiction of a Swines name and Testament, or last will, for the mirth and wit thereof, as it is remembered in Coelius, and before in S. Ie∣rom, and lastly by Alexander Brassicanus, and Geo. Fabritius, I will expresse both in Latine and English in this place. M. Grunnius Corocotta Porcellus testamentum feci, A fiction of of a hogs wil & testament quod quoniam manu mea propria scribe∣re on potui, scribendum dictaui. Magirus cocus dixit veni huc euer sor domi, soliuer sor fugi∣tiue porcelle, ego hodie tibi vitam adimo. Corocotta porcellus dixit si qua feci, si qua peccaui, si qua vascula pedibus meis confregi, rogo domine coque, veniam peto, roganti concede. Magirus coquus dixit, transipuer adfer mihi de culina cultrum, vt hunc porcellum cruentum f ciam. Por∣cellus comprehenditur à famulis ductus sub die 16. Cal. lucerninas, vbi abundant cymae.

Cymatus sign. In English without offence I may translate it thus; I, M. Grunter Hogg-son, little pig haue made this my last will and Testament, which because I could not write with my own hand, I haue caused it to be endited by other. Magirus the Cooke said vnto me, come hither thou vnderminer of houses, thou rooter vp of land, fearefull, fugitiue little Pig, I must this day take away thy life. To whom Hog-son made this answer, If I haue done any harm, if I haue offended, if I haue trod in peeces any vessels of worth vnder my feet, then I en∣treat thee good M. Cooke pardon me, and grant me my request. But Magirus the Cook said, run (sir-kitchin-Boy) and bring me a knife out of the Kitchin, that I may let this litle pig bleed: presently I the little Pig was taken by the seruantes, and by them led the xiv. day of the calends of Torch-light into the place of Coole-worts, when Fiery-furnace & Pepper-spice were Consuls, and when I saw no remedy but that I must die, I entreated the Cooke but an houtes space to make my will. Which when I had obtained, I cald my parents and friends about me, and made my wil in manner following, Of all my meat and prouision left behind me, first I giue vnto Bore-Browne, my father 30 bushels of Buck∣mast. Item I giue to my mother Town-Sow, forty bushels of the best Weate. Item I giue my Sister Whine-pig, 30. bushels of Barly, and for my bowels I bestow them in manner following. I bequeath my bristles to the Coblers and shoomakers, my brains to Wrang∣lers, my eares to the deafe, my tongue to Lawyers and Pratlers, my intrals to the Tripe-makers, my thighes to the Pye-makers, my loines to Women, my bladder to Boies, my taile to young maides, my muscles to shamelesse Dancers, my Anckle-bones, to Lackyes and hunters, my hooues to Theeues. Item I giue vnto this (vnworthy to bee named Cook) the Knife and the pestle, that I brought out of the spinny of an Oake, into my stye, and so let him tye his Necke with a halter. Also my wil is, that there be made for me a monument, wherein shall be engra∣uen in Golden Letters, this inscription or title, M. Grunter Hog-son, Little-Pig, liued nine hundered ninety nine yeares and a halfe, and if he had liued but one halfe yeare longer he he had liued a thousand yeares. And you my Louers and best counsellers of my life, I beseech you do good to my dead carkase, salt it well with the best season of Nutmegs, Pepper, and Honny, that so my name and memory may remaine for euermore. And you my Maisters and kindred which haue beene present at the making of my will, I pray you cause your markes to be put thereunto. Witnesses; Wood-Hogs marke, Bristle-backes marke, Towne-Boares marke, Mountaine-Hogs marke, Bacon-Hogs marke, Swill-Hogs marke, Marsh-Hogs marke. I haue expressed this discourse for no other purpose but to shew the Rea. what proper feig¦ned names haue beene or may be giuen to Swine, and so not to hold him any longer in this discourse, The epithets of Swine. I will proceede from the names to the natures of this beast. And first of all to begin with the common and vulgar epithets, which are as so many short definitions as they are words, as that of Horace, Amica sus luto, a durt-louer, clouen footed, beastly, clamorous, Acron-eater, rough, horrible, fearefull, sluggish, filthy, vncleane, impati∣ent, loud, glad of food, miry, fat, wet, follower, moyst, greedy, tender, and milke-sucker, according to the Poets sayings; Lacte mero pascum pigrae mihi matris alumnum, Ponat: & Aetolo de sue diues edat. Swine are in the most countries of the world. Countries wherein swine do not breede. Yet Aristotle and Aetian report, that there are none in Indian, & Arabia Scein: and moreouer there is in the people of those countries such a detestation of them, that they cannot endure to eate their flesh, which this is not wrought in them by any instinct or opinion of religion (as it is in the Iewes) but rather by a naturall inclination of the place and region wherein they liue, for it is said also that if Swine be brought thither from any other place, they dye within short space. Pliny affirmeth, that there are Boares among some of the Indians which haue horns, and the like is affirmed of the Ethiopians. The Swine of Sycily are accounted the best of all other for food. In Bauaria they are leane, but in Burgundy or the neather Germany, they are fierce, strong, and very fat. Those which are carried into Hispaniola, Pet. Martyr are said to grow to the stature of Mules. Now concerning the seuerall partes of Swyne, it is most certaine that inwardly they do more resemble a mans body then an Ape, for as al writers do affirme, that outwardly the proportion of Apes come nearest to men, according to the Poets verse; Simia quam similis turpissima bestia nobis. So on the other side a Swynes Anatomy doth more liuely expresse the inward members and seate of life, and therefore our predecessours did first of all dissect a Swyne, and then a man, for the Swine was an example or introduction to the other; and in Swine they chuse a leane Hogge, because that all the vessels and instrumentall partes do better and more clearely appeare to the sight then in a fat Hog. There is not according to Aristotle, much marrow in their bones, and their skin is all ouer rough and hairy, The anatho∣my and seue¦ral parts and yet the haire not so thicke as an Oxes, yet much longer and stiffer, standing vp vppon the ridge of the backe, the colour of Swine is vncertaine and varieth not only after the diuersity of the Countrey, but in euery Countrey it is diuers in it selfe, some are white, some branded, some sanded, some red, some black, some pyed, some none of these, and some al of these; yet in Germany for the most part red, and in France and Italy blacke. Betwixt the skin and the flesh there lyeth a fat called Lardo larde and Aruina. Their braine is very fat, and in the waine of the Moone it is lesse then any other beastes. Their eies are hollow, and stand very deepe in their heads, and therefore cannot by Art of man be taken out without danger of death, and if one of them be at any time perished, it is haz∣zard but the Swine dyeth. Their eie-browes moue more downeward toward their Noses, and are againe drawne vp toward their temples, and their forehead is very narrow, by which in ancient time they iudged or deemed a foole or foolish vnwise disposition, as by standing vp of the lips about the canine teeth, betokeneth a contumelious and clamorous rayler, and thicke lips, and a round mouth standing forth, the disposition of a Hog. The snout is long and strong, and yet broad to cast vp the earth for food, hauing on the tippe a rising gristle round, and more piked, at the top betwixt the Nostriles, Aristotle where∣withall it first entereth the earth by digging. Vpon their vnder chap there are teeth which grow out of their head, and the Boares haue some which the females haue not: For euen as the Elephant hath two teeth growing downewarde, so hath the Boare twoe growing vpward. The male as we haue said, hath more then the female, and neither of both do loose or change them by any corse of nature. As the Horse hath his mane, so hath a Swine cer∣taine bristles on his Necke (called therefore by the Graecians Lophia, ) this necke is broad and thicke, and in it lyeth the strength of the beast, and therefore it is obserued by the Physiognomers that a man with such a necke is an angry foole. The collop next to the necke called vulgarly Callasum, ought to be broad & stiffe. It is said of sore harts that they haue their gall in their eares, and indeede in the eares of Swine there is found a certaine humor not much vnlike to a gall: yet lesse liquid, and therefore by reason of the density or thicknesse thereof, comparable to the humor of the Spleene. The ventricle is large to receiue much meate, and to concoct it perfectly, we call it vul∣garly the bucke, and there are in it but few smooth ribs or crestes, and in the liuer partes which are very great, there is a certaine hard thing white like a stone. The females haue twelue vdders or dugs vnder the belly, but neuer lesse then ten, if they want of twelue, and the Boares haue their stones on their seat behind them ioyned together, which being taken off, are called by the Latines Polimenta. But in the female there is a great miracle of nature, for the place of conception is one∣ly open to the vdders or downeward, but when her lust commeth on her, Aristotle. by often tickling and striuing she turneth it about to meete with the Boares instrument in generation. And this bag is called Apria, which hangeth in the female inward, as the stones of the Boare do outwardly. In some places there are Swine which are not clouen-footed, but whole hooued like a Horse, yet this is very seldome or accidentall, for the most part al are clouen-footed, Aristotle affirmeth, that there are Swine whole hooued, in Illiria, Poeonia, and Macedonia, and Albertus saith, that he hath bin informed of some such seene in Eng∣land, and also in Flanders. The Anckles are doubtfull, as it were in proportion betwixt the Anckle of a whole and of a clouen hoose. Now by this that hath beene said and shall be added, we must make vp the description of a perfect Swine, for the better knowledge of the Reader, which may be this, The choyse of outward likes of the best Swyne. of a straight and small head. The best forme is to haue large members, except the head and feet, and of one vniforme colour, not parted or variable, not old, but of a good race or breed. There be some that for the choice of their Swine do make this obseruation, they chuse them by their face, by the race, and by the Region, by the face, when the Boare and Sow are of good and beautifull aspects; by the race, if they bring forth many and safely, not casting Pigges, by the Region when they are not bred where they bee of a small, slender, or vile stature, and especially this is obserued in the Male, bycause that in all beastes they are oftentimes more like the sire then the Damme; therefore it is better in Swine to haue a thicke, round, and well set Hogge, then a long sided one, howbeit some approue Hogs with long Legs. The buttockes ought to be fleshy, the belly large and prominent, and the Snowts short and turning vpward, yet the Sowe is best, that hath the largest sides, if all the other members be correspondent. Likewise in cold Countries they must chuse their Swine with rough and thicke haire, but in warmer and more temperate Climats, any haire be it neuer so small will serue the turne, especially if it be blacke. And thus much shall serue in this place for their seue∣rall partes and members: Now wee will proceede on to their nourishment and copula∣tion. The ood o . It is most certaine that Swine are of a hot temperament, and for that cause it com∣meth to passe that they do not loose their Winter haire, for by reason of the fat neere to their skinne, there is aboundance of heate which keepeth fast the roots of the haire. Their food therfore and nourishment is easily digested in euery part, for that which is so strong in the nouriture of the haire, must needs be of correspondent power in other parts. Some haue thought that Swine care not for Grasse or Hearbes, but onely rootes, and therefore hath a peculiar snout to attain them, but I find by experience that they wil eat grasse aboue the earth, aswel as rootes beneath, & they loue to feede in heardes together. They loue a¦boue measure Acornes, and yet being giuen to them alone they are hurtfull, and bring no lesse damage to them then to Sheepe (though not so often) especially to Sowes that be with pigge. The best time for gathering of Acorns is in Nouember, and it is a worke for Women and Children. The Woodes of Italy are so full of Acornes that they nou∣rish aboundance of Swine, and that therewith are fed the greatest part of the Romaine people. They delight also in Bucke-mast, and that meate maketh the Swines flesh light, easie of digestion, and apt for the stomacke: In some Countries Hawes haue the same vertue to fat Hogges, that is in Acornes, for they make them waighty, straight, neate, and sweete. The next vnto this Holme Berries do fat Hogges, sauing that they procure loosenesse, ex∣cept they be eaten by little and little. There is a tree which hath such bitter fruite (cal∣led Haliphlocus ) whereof no beast will tast, heereof Hogges wil tast, but in extreame fa∣mine and hunger, Pl ius when they are without all other food and meate. The fruite or Apples of Palme-trees (especially such as grow in salt grounds neare the Sea sides, as in Cyrene of Affrica, and Iudea, and not in Egypt, Cyprus, Syria, Heluetia, and Assiria ) do fatten and feed Hogges: And indeed there is scarce any food whereof they do not eate, as also no place wherein they picke not out some liuing, both in Mountains, and Fens, and plaine fieldes, but best of all neare waters, wherein by the bankes sides they ga∣ther many sweete and nourishable morsels. There are no better abiding places for Hogs then are the woods, wherein abound ey∣ther Oakes, Beeches, Corke-trees, Holme, wilde Oliues, Tamariske, Hasels, Apples, or Crab-trees, white Thorne, the Greeke Carobs, Pine-trees, Corne-trees, Lote-trees, places of their abode. Prune-trees, Shrubs, Hawes, or wilde Peares, or Medlers, and such like; for these frutes grow ripe successiuely one after the other, for there is no time of the yeare wherein some of them are not to be gathered soft and norishable, whereby the heards of swine may be maintained. But if at any time this food cease, and not to be found, then must ther be some other prouision out of the earth, such as is corne, or graines, and turn your Hogs to moist pla∣ces where they may picke vp worms, and suck vp fat fenny water, which thing is aboue al other things gratefull to this beaste, for which cause it pleased the Holi-ghost in scripture to compare the pleasure that beastely men take in sinning to the wallowing of swine in the mire. The Dogge (saith S. Peter ) is returned to his vomit, and the Sow that was washed to wallow in the mire. For this cause also you must suffer them to digge in the water, and to eat Canes and wilde Bul-rushes, likewise the rootes and tops of Water-cresses; and you must prouide to lay vp for them in water Acornes, and not spare corne to giue it them by hand, as Beanes, Pease, Fitches, Barly and such like: And Columella (from whome I haue taken these instructions) addeth moreouer, that in the spring time before your Hogs go abroad to bite at the sweet and fresh-growing-hearbes, Varro least they prouoke them to loose∣nesse, you must giue them some sodden drinke, wash or swill, by vertue whereof that mis∣chiefe must be auoided, for if it be not, such leannesse wil follow, that it will ouerthrowe and kil them. In some Countries they also giue them the scapes or refuse Grapes of Vintage, Aelianus. and moreouer the frutes of yew tree, which is poison to Dogges. Aristomachus the Athenian by many and sundry praises aduanceth three-leaued grasse, and among other, for that as when it is greene it is commodious for sheepe, so being dried it is wholesome to swine. They loue greene corn, yet it is reported that if swine eat of it in the Isle of Salamine, their teeth by the law of the countrey are beaten out of their mouthes. It is wholesome to giue them crude or rawe barley, especially to a Bore when he is to covple with a sowe, but vnto a sow with pigge sod. There is in Bauaria a kinde of Scallion which beareth a red-purple-flower, like to the flower of the Lilly of the vallies, which is greatly sought after and deuoured by swine. They also seeke after wilde Vines, and the hearbe called Hogs-bread, and the roote of wilde rapes, which beareth leaues like vnto violets but sharper, and a white roote without milke: By some it is called Buchspicke, bycause it groweth in woodes amonge Beeches. They eat also flesh, and abstain not from fat Bacon, and heerein they differ from most of the rauening creatures, for Dogges will not taste of Dogges flesh, and Beares of Beares, yet will Hogges eat of Swines flesh, yea many times the damme eateth hir younge ones: And it is found that swine haue not abstaind from the flesh of men and children, for when they haue been slaine by theeues, before they could be found, Albertus. Aelianus. the greatest part of their body was torne in pieces and eaten by wilde swine. And indeed as we see some Hens eat vp the Egges that they themselus haue layd, so shal we obserue some sows to deuoure the frutes of their owne wombes, whereat we ought not to maruel as at a monstrous or pro∣digious thing, but rather acknowledge a naturall voracity, constrained in them thorough famine and impatience. They also eat Snailes and Salamanders, especially the Bores of the mountaines in Ci∣licia, and although there be in Salamanders a verye deadly poison, yet doeth it not hurt them at all, but afterward when men or beasts tast of such a swines flesh, the operation of the poison worketh vpon them mortally: neither is this any maruaile, for so it is when a Frog eateth of a Toad: and whereas if a man eat Hemlocke, presently al his blood congea∣leth in his body and he dieth, but if a Hogge eat thereof, hee not onely not dieth, but thriueth and groweth fat thereby. Aristotle reported one great wonder of a place about Thracia (as he saith) wherein for the compasse of twenty paces there groweth Barley, whereof men eate safely, but Oxen, and sheep, and other creatures auoid it as mortall poyson, and swine wil not vouchsafe to tast of mens excrements that haue eaten thereof, but auoide them carefully. As swine delight in meat, so also they delight more in drinke, and especially in the Sum∣mer time, and therefore they which keepe sucking Sowes, must regard to giue them their belliful of drinke twice a day, and generally we must not lead them to the waters as we do Goats, and sheepe, but when the heat of Summer is about the rising of the Dog-star, we must keepe them altogether by water sides, that so they may at their owne pleasure, both drinke and lie downe to wallow in the mire, and if the coasts be so dry that this cannot bee obtained or permitted, then must they haue water set in troughes and vessels, whereof they may tast at their owne pleasure, for otherwise through want of water they grow liuer and lung sicke. Columella The miery water doth most quickly make them fat, and they will drink wine or beere vnto drunkennesse, and in those countries where Grapes grow if the swine come into the vintage, they grow drunke with eating of grapes. Also if the Leeze of wine be mingled with their meat, they grow fat aboue measure and sencelesse in their fat, whereby it hath bin seene that a mouse hath eaten into the sides of a fat Hog without the resistance of the beast: and the like is reported by Pliny of the sonne of L. Apronius who had bin a Consul, for his bodie grew so fat that it was taken from him his body remaining immouable. And in the spring time Swine of their owne accord grow so fat, that many times they cannot stand on their legs their bodies be so heauy, nor go any whit, so that if they are to be remo¦ued, they are not to be drouen but to be carried in a cart. Varro and Crescentiensis do report admirable things of the fatnes of swine For first Var∣ro saith, The great fat¦nes of swine. that hee receiued knowledge from a credible honest man in Portugall, of a Swine that there was killed, the offall wherof with two ribbes was sent to Volumnius a Senatour, which weighed twenty and three pounds, and the fat betwixt the skin and the bone, was a foot and three fingers thicke. Vnto this he addeth the story of the Arcadian Sowe, who suffered a mouse to eat into her fat, and breed young ones therein, after she made a nest: which thing he likewise affirmeth of a Cow. And Crescentiensis reporteth of an other Lu∣sitenian Swine, which after the death, weighed fiue hundred seuenty and fiue pounds, and the Lard of that Hogge was one foot and three fingers broad. And the like may be said of a Hogge at Basill, nourished by a certaine Oile-man, in whose Larde or fatte, after his death were found manie passages of mice too and fro, which they had gnawed into his body without the sence of the beast. The meat & best manner to fatten Hogges. Hogs growe fat in short time. In auncient daies (as Pliny writeth) they put them vp to fatting threescore daies, and first of all they made them fast three daies together, after six daies they may senciblie be perceiued to grow fat. There is not any beast that can better or more easilie be accustomed to al kinds of food, and therefore doeth verie quicklie grow fat, the quantitie and stature of their bodie considered, for whereas an Oxe or Cowe, or Hart, and such like Beasts aske long time, yet a Swine which eateth of all sorts of meate, doth very quickely euen in a moneth or two or three at the most, prooue woorthye the knife and also his maisters table, although in some places they put them vppe to fatting a whole yeare together, and how much they profit and gather in their feeding, it is verye easie for them to obserue that daily keep and attend them, and haue the charge and ouer∣seeing of them. And there must be had great care of their drinke. In Thracia, after they put vp a Hog to fatting, they giue him drinke the first daie, and then let him fast from drink two daies, and so giue him drinke by that proportion, till the seuenth day, afterwarde they obserue no more dyet for their Swine, but giue them their fill of meat and drinke till the slaugh∣ter day. In other Countries they diet them in this sort: After Beanes and Pease they giue them drinke aboundantly, because they are solide and harde, but after Oats and such like, as meale, they giue them no drinke, least the meale swimme vp and down in their bel∣ly, and so be eiected into the excrements without any great profitte. There is nothinge whereon it liueth, but thereby it will grow fatte except grazing, and therefore all manner of graine, Millet seed, Figges, Acornes, Nuttes, Peares, Apples, Cucumbers, Rootes, and such things cause them to rise in flesh gratefully, and so much the sooner if they bee permitted to roote now and then in the mire. They must not be vsed to one simple, or vnmingled, or vncompounded meate, but with diuers compounds, for they reioyce in variety and change like other beastes, for by this mutation of food, they are not onely kept from inflamation and windinesse, but part of it alway goeth into flesh, and part into fat. Some vse to make their stye wherein they are inclosed to be very darke and close, Aelianus for their more speedy fatting, and the reason is good, because the beast is more apt to be qui∣et. You shall haue Bakers that will fat their Hogges with bran, and in Elsatia a country of Germany, they fat them with Beane-meale, for thereby they grow fat very speedily, and some with barley meale wet with flat milke. And in the Alpes they fat them with Whaye, whereby their fat and flesh groweth more white and sweete then if they were fatted with Acorns, yet whay is very dangerous: for such is the rauening intemperancy of this beast to swil in whatsoeuer is pleasant to his taste, that many times in drinking of Whaye their bellies growe extended aboue measure, euen to death, except that they bee dieted by a wife keeper, and driuen vp and downe not suffered to rest till it flow foorth againe backe∣ward. Ba ly is very nourishable to them, whether it be sod or raw, and especially for Sowes with Pigge, for it preserueth the young ones til deliuery, and at the farrowing causeth an easie and safe pigging. And to conclude this part, Millers and Bakers fat with meale and bran, brewers with Ale or Barley steeped in Ale, Oyle-men with the refuse of Nuttes and Grapes. Some again there be that grew fat with the rootes of Ferne. Al ertus. When a Sow is very fat she hath alway but little milke, and therefore is not apte to make any good tidie pigs, and yet as all other beasts grow leane when they giue sucke, so also doth swine. Al swine in hot regions by reason of a viscous humor, groweth more fat then in the cold regions. In that part of Frisia neer Germany, they fat Oxen and swine with the same meate, for there you shal haue in one stable an Oxe, and a Hogge tyed behind him at his taile, for the Oxe be∣ing tied to the rack eateth Barly in the straw & chaffe, which he swalloweth down without chewing, and so the softest thereof is digested in his belly, & the other commeth forth whole in his dung, which the Hogge licketh vp and is therewithal fatned. And it is to bee remembred, that swine gelded or splaied, doe sooner fatten then anie other. To conclude, they loue the dung of men, and the reason thereof is, because the seat of their lust is in their liuer which is very broade and insatiable, and there is nothinge that hath a duller sence of smelling then this Beaste, and therefore it is not offended with any carrion or stinking smel, but with sweete and pleasant ointments, as wee shall shew after∣wardes. Concerning their generation or copulation, Of the copu∣l tion and b eed of Swine. it is to be noted that a Bore or male swine wil not remaine of validity and good for breed past three yeare old, by the opinion of all the auncient, for such as he engendereth after that age, are but weake and not profitable to be kept and nourished. At eight moneths olde he beginneth to leape the female, and it is good to keepe him close from other of his kinde for two moneths before, and to feede him with Barly raw, but the sow with Barly sodden. One Bore is sufficient for ten Sowes, if once he heare the voice of his female, desiring the Bore he will not eate vntil hee be ad∣mitted, and so he wil continue pining, and indeed hee wil suffer the female to haue al that can bee, and groweth leane to fatten her; for which cause Homer like a wise husbandman prescribeth, that the male and female Swine be kept assunder till the time of their copula∣tion. They continue long in the act of copulation, and the reason thereof is, because his lust is not hot, nor yet proceeding from heat, yet is his seed verie plentiful. They in the time of their copulation are angry, & outragious, fighting with one another very irefully, and for that purpose they vse to harden their ribs by rubbing them voluntarily vppon Trees. They choose for the most part the morning for copulation, but if he be fat and young, he can endure it in euery part of the yeare & day, but when he is leane, and weake, or old, he is not able to satisfie his females lust, for which cause she many times sinketh vnderneath him, and yet he filleth her while she lyeth on the ground, both of them on their buttocks together. They engender oftentimes in one yeare, the reason whereof is to be ascribed to their meat or some extraordinary heat, which is a cōmon thing to al that liue familiarly among men, and yet the wilde swine couple and bring forth but once in the yeare, because they are seldome filled with meat, endure much paine to get and much cold, for Venus in men and beasts, is a companion of satiety, and therefore they onely bring forth in the springe time, and warme weather, and it is obserued that in what night soeuer a wilde Hogge or sow farroweth there will be no storme or raine. There bee many causes why the tame do∣mesticall Hogs bring forth and engender more often then the wilde, first because they are fed with ease, secondly because they liue togither, without fear, & by society are more often prouoked to lust, on the otherside the wilde swine come sildome together, and are often hungrey, for which cause they are more dull and lesse venereous, yea many times they haue but one stone, for which cause they are called by Aristotle and the ancient Grae∣cians Chlunes, and Monorcheis. The times of a ows bo g But concerning the sow, she beginneth to suffer the Bore at eight moneths of age, al∣though according to the diuersity of regions and aire, they differ in this time of their co∣pulation, for some begin at foure moneths, and other againe tary till they be a yeare old, and this is no maruell, for euen the male which engendereth before he be a yeare olde, begetteth but weake, tender, and vnprofitable Pigges. The best time of their admission is from the Calends of February vnto the Vernall Equinoctiall, for so it hapneth that they bring forth the young in the summer time, for foure months she goeth with young, and it is good that the pigges be farrowed before haruest, which you purpose to keepe al the yeare for store. After that you perceiue that the sowes haue conceiued, then seperate them from the bores, least by the raging lust of their prouoking, they be troubled and endangered to a∣bortment. There be some that say, a sow may beare young till she be seauen yeare olde, but I will not striue about that whereof euery poore swineheard may giue ful satisfaction. At a yeare olde a sow may do well, if shee be couered by the bore in the month of Fe∣bruary. But if they begin not to beare til they be twenty moneths old, or two yeares, they wil not onely bring foorth the stronger, but also beare the longer time euen to the seauenth yeare, and at that time it is good to let them go to riuers, fennes, or miery places, for euen as a man is delighted in washing or bathing, so doth swine in filthy wallowing in the mire; therein is their rest, ioy, and repose. Albertus reporteth, that in some places of Germany a sow hath bin found to beare young eight years, and in other till they were fifteen years old▪ but after fifteene yeare it was neuer seene that a sow brought foorth younge pigges. If the sowe bee fatte, she is alwaies the lesse prone to conceiue with young, whether shee be young or old. When first of all they beginne to seeke the Bore, they leape vpon other swine, and in processe cast foorthe a certaine purgation called Apria, which is the same in a sow which Hippomanes is in a mare, then they also leaue their heard-fellowes, which kind of behauior or action, the Latines call by a peculiar Verb Subare, and that is applied to Harlottes and wanton Women, by Horace: Iam{que} subando, Tecta cubilia tecta{que} rumpit. We in English call it Boaring, because she neuer resteth to shew her desire till she come to a bore, and therefore when an olde Woman lusteth after a man, being past lust by all natural possibility, she is cald Anus subans. And the beast is so delighted with this pleasure of carnal copulation, that many times she falleth asleepe in that action, and if the male be young or dull, Plinius. then wil the female leap vpon him and prouoketh him, yea in her rage she s tteth manie times vpon men and Women, especially if that they doe weare any white Garments, but this rage of lust is abated, if their Apria and priuy place be wet and moist¦ned with Vineger. They haue their proper voices and cries for this time of their boaring, which the bore or male vnderstandeth presently. They are filled at one copulation, and yet for their better safegarde, and to preserue them from abortment, it is good to suffer the bore to couer hir twice or thrice, and more ouer, if she conceiue not at the first, then may she safly be permitted three or foure times together, and it is obserued that except her eares hang downe flagging, and carelessely, she is not filled but reiecteth the seed, but if her eares fall downeward, and so hang all the time that the Boare is vpon her, then is it a most certaine token that she is filled, and hath conceiued with young. After foure monthes (as we haue saide) the Sow farroweth her Pigs, that is to say, in the fifth month, as it were in the seuenteenth weeke: For so is this beast enabled by nature to beare twice in the yeare, and yet to sucke her young ones two monthes together. And there is no clouen-footed-beast that beareth many at a time except the Sow, except in her age, for then she beginneth to loose her Apria or purgation, and so many times mis∣carrieth, and many times beare but one. Yet this is maruailous that as she beareth many, so she engendereth them perfect without blindnesse, lamenesse, or any such other di∣stresse, although as wee haue saide before, that in some places you shall see Swine whole hooued like a Horsse, yet most commonly and naturally their feete are clouen, and therefore is the wonder accounted the greater of their manifolde multiplycation, and the reason thereof may arise from the multitude and great quantity of their foode, for the humour cannot be so well auoyded and dispersed in so little a bodye as Swine haue, as in Mares and Cowes, and therefore that humour turneth to multiply nature and na∣turall kind, and so it commeth to passe, Niphus. that by ouermuch humour turned into a natu∣rall seede, it breedeth much young, and for little humour it bringeth forth a few Pigges, and those also are not only perfect, but also she is sufficiently furnished with Milk to nou¦rish them, till they be able to feed themselues. For as a fat ground or soyle is to the plants that groweth on it, euen so is a fruitefull Sow to the pigs which she hath brought forth. Aristotle The number which a Sow beareth. Their ordinary number which they bring forth and can nourishe is twelue, or six∣teene at the most, and very rare it is to see sixteene brought vp by one Sow. Howbeit it hath beene seene that a Sow hath brought forth twenty, but far more often seuen, eyght or ten. There is a story in Festus of a Sow that brought forth thirty at a time, his words be these; The Sow of Aeneas Lauinius did bring forth thirty white Pigges at one time, wherefore the Lauinians were much troubled about the signification of such a monstrous farrow, at last they receiued answer, that their Citty should be thirty years in building, and being so they called it Alba, in remembrance of the thirty white Pigges. And Pliny affirmeth, that the Images of those pigges and the Sow their damme, were to be seene in his daies in publique places, and the body of the Damme or Sowe preserued in Salt by the priestes of Alba, to be shewed to all such as desired to bee certified of the truth of that Story. But to returne to the number of young pigges which are ordinary and without mira∣cle bred in their dammes belly, which I find to be so many as the Sow hath dugges for, so many she may well nourish and giue sucke vnto, and not more, and it seemeth a speciall worke of God which hath made this tame beast so fruitefull, for the better recompence to man for her meate and custody. By the first farrow it may be gathered how fruitfull she will be, but the second and third do most commonly exceede the first, and the last in old age is inferior in number to the first. Iuuenal hath a comparison betwixt a white sow and an Heighfar. Scropha foecundior al∣ba, more fruitefull then a white Sow, but belike the white Sowes do bring more then any other colour. Now the reason of the Poets speech was because that there was an Heighfar in the daies of Ptolomy the younger, which at one time brought forth sixe Calues; Whereuppon came the prouerbe of Regia Vaccula, for a fruitefull Cow, for Helenus telleth this to Aeneas. Vpon the Sow and thirty pigges there is this aunswer of the Oracle to the Lauiniens concerning Alba : Cum tibi sollicito secreti ad fluminis vndam, Littoreis ingens, inuenta sub ilicibus sus, Triginta capitum foetus enixa iacebit, Alba solo recubans, alibi circum vbera nati, Is lecus vrbis erit, requies ea certe laborum. And Iuuenal saith thus of it; Conspicitur sublimis aper cui candida nomen, Scropha dedit laetis phrygibus mirabile sumen, Et nunquam visis triginta clara mamillis. When the young one commeth forth of the Dammes belly wounded or imperfect, by reason of any harme therein receiued, (it is called Metacherum ) and many times swine engender Monsters, which commeth to passe oftner in little beastes then in the greatest, because of the multitude of cels appointed for the receipt of the seede, by reason wher∣of, sometimes there are two heades to one body, sometimes two bodies and one head, sometime three Legges, sometime two before and none behind, such were the Pigges without eares, which were farrowed at that time that Dionisius the Tyrant went to War a∣gainst Dion, for all their partes was perfect but their eares, as it were to teach how incon∣siderately against all good counsell, the Tyrant vndertooke that voyage; Such are commonly found to bee bred amonge them, also now and then of an vnspeakable smalenesse like Dwarfes, which cannot liue, hauing no mouth nor eares, called by the Latines Aporcelli : If a Sow great with Pigge do eate aboundantly of Acornes, it causeth her to cast her farrow and to suffer abortement, and if she grow fat, then is she lesse fruit∣full in Milke. Now for the choyce of a Pigge to keepe for store, it must be chosen from a lusty and strong damme bred in the Winter time, (as some say) for such as are bred in the heate of Summer are of lesse value, because they prooue tender, small, and ouermoyst, and yet also if they be bred in the cold of winter they are smal, by reason of extream cold, and their Dammes forsake them through want of Milke: and moreouer bycause they through hun∣ger pinch and bite their dugges, so as they are very vnprofitable to be nourished and pre∣serued in the Winter time, rather they are fit to be killed and eaten young. But this is to bee obserued for reconciliation of both opinions, namely, that in hot Countries such Hogges are preferred that bee bred in the Winter, but in colde such as are bred in March or Aprill: within tenne daies after their farrowing they grow to haue teeth, and the Sowe euer offereth her foremost Dugge to the pigge, that commeth first out of her belly, and the residue take their fortune as it falleth, one to one, and another to another, for it seemeth shee regardeth the first by a naturall instinct, not so much to prefer it, as that by the example thereof the residue may be inuited to the like sucking by imitation, yet euery one (as Tzetzes saith) keepeth him to his first choice. And if any of them be taken away from his Dugge that is killed or sold, that dugge presently dryeth and the Milke turneth backewarde, and so vntill all bee gone, one excepted, and then it is nourished with no more then was ordained at the beginning for it. If the olde Sow want Milke at any time, the supply must be made by giuing the young ones fryed or parched Corne, for raw Corne or drinke procureth loosenesse, and it is best for them to be suckled in the place where their Damme vsually abideth. For weaning of them it is not good to let more then fiue or sixe sucke of her at one time, for although every one sucke but his owne Dug, yet by the multitude, the Milke is dryed vp: After two months old they may safely be disioyned from their Dame and weaned, so as euery yeare the Sow may breede eight monthes, and giue sucke foure: it is best to let them feed asunder from their dams till they haue vrterly forgotten to sucke. And thus much for the procreation and nourishment of old and young Swine. The office & first instituti∣on of Swine-heardes. This beast loueth society and to liue in heardes or flockes together, and therefore the auncients haue inuented Hogge-keepers, whom they call Swyne-heardes, wherein there was wont to be considered these instructions, first he accustomed them to the sound of his horne, for by that he called them abroad out of their foldes to their feedings, for they ne∣uer suffered aboue twelue together at the trough or parcell of meate. It becommeth a Swyne-heard (saith Collumella ) to be vigilent, diligent, industrious, and wise, for hee must carry in his head the state of all that he nourisheth, both old and young, barren and fruit∣full, and consider the time of their farrowing, wheather they be neare at hand or far off, that so none may bee lost through the want of his obseruation, being farrowed, hee must consider and looke vppon them to see which are fit for store, and which are not, what are their natures and probabilities, how much milk their dam is able to afford them, and how many she is to bring vp, especially to regard that euery Sow bring vp no more then her own pigs, for swine being out of the sty do mingle one with another, and loose their owne young ones, and when she lyeth downe to giue them sucke, she lendeth her paps as well to strangers as to her owne, and therefore herein must the care and wit of the heards-men appeare, for if there be many he must shut vp euery Sow with her young, and if that can∣not be, then with a little Pitch or Tar let him giue seueral markes to the seuerall farrowes, that so his memory may not be confounded. Another remedy to auoyd the confusion of young Pigs one among another, is so to frame the threshold of the stye, that the pigs may not be able to go in and out, for the Sow can more easily goe ouer, and so she may bee eased of their company, and they safely included at home, and so shall no stranger breake into them; but euery one in their own nest expect the returne of their dam, which ought not to exceede the number of eight, for although the soecundity of Swine bee great, yet it is better to kil off two or three if their number bee aboue eight, then to per∣mit them to sucke their dam, for this multitude of suckers do quickly draw away all nou∣rishment from the dam: and when they are but eight at the most, regard must bee had that the Sow be welfed with sod barly or such like, least through a couetous pinching of the beast, leanenesse follow to her ouerthrow & destruction. Another point of a good swine-heard, is to sweepe oftentimes the sty, for although such be the nature of the beast that it defileth all things, and will be wallowing in the mire, yet will she also be very desirous of a cleane lodging, and delight much in the same; and when they be shut vp they must not be enclosed like other beastes altogether, for one of them will throng and lye vpon ano∣ther, but there must be seueral porches and hatches to seauer & distinguish ther lodgings so as the great with pig may lye in one place, Collumella Palladius and the other ready to be deliuered by them∣selues, free from al incursion & violence. These deuisions or separations ought to be some 3. or 4. foot high, so as they may not be able to leape ouer to one another, & not couered, to the intent that euery swine heard both man & Boy may freely look ouer to them, and tel them if any chance to be missing, or else help a poore pig when it is ouer laid by his dam. Whensoeuer the Swineheard clenseth the sty, then let him cast in sand or some other drying thing into it, that all the moysture and wetnesse may be drunke vp. The damme ought not to be permitted for the first ten daies to go forth of the stable, except to drinke, and afterward let her go abroad into some adiacent pasture, not far off, that so by her of∣ten return she may the better giue suck to her young ones. When the litle ones are a fort∣night or three weekes old, they desire to follow their parent, wherfore they must be shut vp from their mother, and feed alone in her absence, that they may better endure it, af∣terward when they shalbe weaned. They must be fed in the summer time in the morning, before the heat bee strong, and in the heate of the day led into some watry or shadowy place, that so they may be freed frō extreamity til the coole of the day return again, where in they must be suffered to feed. In the winter time, they are not to bee led abroad till the frost and yce be thawed and dissolued. Ten Boares are sufficient for an hundred Sows, & although some keepe fiue or six hundred in a heard, as we may read in scripture of the great heards of Swine, into which our sauiour Christ permitted the Diuels to enter, yet is it not safe or wholsome to keepe aboue an hundred together, for a lesse flock or heard requireth lesse cost, charge, and attendance. There is a speech of Tremellius Scrofa, tending to the commendation of the custody or nourishing of Swine, for thus he writeth: Agriculturae ab initio sui studiosus, nec de pecore suillo mihi mino cura est, quam vobis magnis pecuarijs. Cui enim eares non est communis? quis enim nostrum fundum colit quin sues habent, & qui non au∣dierit putras nostros dicere ignanum & sumptus sum esse, qui succidiam in carnario suspendit po∣tius ab laniario quam ex domestico fundo? That is to say, I haue beene long giuen to follow husbandry, and I have alway had as great care of my Swyne, as other men of greater cat∣tell. For what is there, whereunto swine are not profitable? who tilleth land and keepeth not hogs, and who hath not heard our fathers say, that he is an idle ill husband vvhich hangs vp all his prouision in the shambles, and liueth rather vpon the Butchers, then vpon his ovvne ground? Thus far Tremellius. Another part of a good Svvinehard is, to looke to the gelding of his Svvyne, and splaying of the females, for if all bee suffered to procreate and engender it is more danger that Swine would in short time eate vp men, rather then men Swine. The Latins call such a Hogge gelded Macalis, and Porcastrus, that is Porcus castratus, the Germans ein barg, or Boetz, from whence seemeth to be deriued our English Barrow-hog (for so wee call a gelded-male-hog) and a female Basse. Pliny The best time therefore to geld them is in the old Moone, or as we say in the waine of the Moone, but Hesiod prescribeth, that an Oxe and a Boare should be gelded in the second quarter and first day thereof, and Aristo∣tle is of opinion that is skilleth not what age a Boare be when hee is libbed; but it is cleare by the best experienced among these beasts, there are two times of gelding them; one in the spring, and the other in the Autumne, and this is to be done after a double manner; First, by making two incisions or wounds vpon his stones, out of which holes the stones are to be pressed forth. The second way is more perillous, yet more cleanely; for first of all at one wounde or incision they take out one stone, then that being forth, with their knyfe they cut the small skin which parteth the stones in the cod, and so presse foorth the second stone at the first wound, afterward applyeng to it ordinary medicines, such as we will describe in the trea∣tise of their diseases. And the opinion of Varo is, that it is good to lib them at halfe a yeare old, or at a yeare old, or at three or foure yeare old, for their better fatting; but best at a yeare, and not vn∣der halfe a yeare. When the stones are taken forth of an old Bore, suppose two, or three or foure yeare old, they are called by the Latins Polimenta, because with them they poli∣shed and smoothed garments. The female also is gelt or splayed, (although she often bore pigs) whereof they open the side (neere her loines) and take away from her Apria, and receptacles of the Boares seede, s us which being sewed vp againe, in short time is enclosed in fat; this they do by hang∣ing them vp by their forelegs, and first of all they which do it most commodiously, must cause them to fast two daies before; and then hauing cut it, they sew vp and close fast a∣gaine the wound or incision, and this is doone in the same place of the female, that the stones are to be taken out in the male (as Aristotle writeth) but rather it appeareth by good examination and proofe, that it is to be cut out on the right, against the bone (called os sa∣crum. Abenzoor ) And the onely cause of this Sow-gelding is, for their better growth and fatning; which in some Countries they vse, being forced thereunto through their penury & want of food; but whereas is plenty of food, there they neuer know it: and the inuenters hereof were the Graecians, whose custome was to cut out the whole matrix. And thus much for the libbing, gelding, and splaying of Swine. The nature of this beast manius Pliny This beast is a most vnpure and vncleane beast, and rauening; and therefore we vse (not improperly) to cal Obscoene and filthy men or women, by the name of Swyne or Sowes. They which haue foreheads, eyelids, lips, mouth, or Necke, like Swyne, are accounted foolish, wicked, and wrathful: al their sences (their smelling excepted) are dull, because▪ they haue no articles in their hearts, but haue thicke blood, and some say, that the acute∣nesse and ripenesse of the soule, standeth not in the thicknesse of the blood, but in the co∣uer and skin of the body, and that those beasts which haue the thickest skins, are accoun∣ted the most blockish & farthest from reason but those which haue the thinnest & softest, are the quickest of vnderstanding: an example whereof is apparant in the Oyster, Oxe, and Ape. They haue a maruaylous vnderstanding of the voyce of their feeder, and as ar∣dent desire to come at his call, through often custome of meat, whereupon lyeth this ex∣cellent story. When certaine pyrates in the Tirrhene sea, had entred a Hauen, and went on land, Aelianus they came to a Swines stye and drew out thereof diuers Swine, and so carried them on shipboard, and loosing their Anckers and tacklings, doe depart and saile away. The Swine heardes seeing the pirats commit this robbery, and not being able to deliuer and rescue their cattel because they wanted both company & strength, sufferd the theeues in si∣lence to ship & carry away their cattle: at last, when they saw the Theeues rowing out of the port, and lanching into the deepe, then they lift vp their voyces and with their accusto∣med cries or cals, called vpō their Swine to come to their meat; assoone as the swine heard the same, they presently gat to the right side of the vessell or barke, and there flocking to∣gither, the ship being vnequally ballanced or loden, ouerturned al into the sea, and so the pirats were iustly drowned in reward of the theft, and the stolne Swine swam safely backe again to their maisters and keepers. The nature of this beast is to delight in the most filthy and noysome places, for no other cause, (as I think) but because of their dul sences. Their voice is cald Grunnitus gruntling, Sordida sus pascens ruris gramina grunnit, which is a terri¦ble voice to one that is not accustomed therunto, (for euen the Elephants are afraid there∣of) especially when one of them is hurt or hanged fast, or bitten, then all the residue as it were in compassion condoling his misery, run to him and cry with him, and this voice is very common in swine at all hands to cry, except he be carried with his head vpwards, to∣wards heauen, & then (it is affirmed) he neuer cryeth, the reason wherof is giuen by Aphro∣disien : because it is alwaie acustomed to looke downward, and therefore when it is forced to look vpward it is suddenly appaled and afraid, held with admiration of the goodly space aboue him in the heauens, like one astonished, holdeth his peace (some say that then the artery of his voice is pressed) and so he cannot cry alowd. There is a fish in the riuer Ache∣lous which gruntleth like a hog, whereof Iuuenal speaketh, saying: Et quam remigibus grun∣nisse Elpenor a porcis. And this voice of swine is by Caecilius attributed to drunken men. The milke of Swine is very thicke, and therefore cannot make whay like a sheepes, howbeit it suddenly coagulateth and congealeth togither. Among diuers males or Boates when one of them is conqueror, the residue giue obedience and yeald vnto him, and the chiefe time of their fight or discord is in their lust, or other occasions of food, or strangnesse, at which time it is not safe for any man to come neare them, for feare of danger from both parties, and especially those which weare white garments. And Strabo reporteth in generall of al the Belgian Swine, that they were so fierce, strong, and wrathfull, that it was as much daun∣ger to com ner them as to angry wolfes. Nature hath made a great league betwixt Swyne and Crocodiles, for there is no beast that may so freely feed by the banks sides of Nilus, Herus as the swine may, without all hurt by the Crocodil. Other Serpents, especially the smaller Serpentes which are oftentimes deuoured by Swine, Aristotle saith, that when many of them are together they feare not the wolfe, & yet they neuer deuoure any wolfe, but on∣ly with their scarring and gruntling noise feare them away. When a wolfe getteth a swine, Calcaguinus Ʋarro Plinius Sextus he deuoureth him, and before he can eate him, draggeth him by the eares to some water to coole his teeth in his flesh (which aboue measure burne in deuouring his flesh.) It hath bin seene that a Lyon was afraid of a Sow, for at the setting vp of his bristles he ran away. It is reported that swine will follow a man all the day long which hath eaten the braine of a Crow in his pottage: and Nigidius affirmeth, that Dogs will run away from him that hath pulled off a ticke from a swines backe. The people of Mossynaecum did engender man with Woman publicke like swine, and Stobaeus writing against women saith, that some of them are deriued from one beast, and some from another, and namely a woman discended of a Sow sitteth at home, and doth neither good nor harme: but Simonides writeth otherwise, and namely that a woman borne of a Sow sitteth at home suffering all things to be impure, vncleane, and out of order, without decking, dressing, or ornament, and so she groweth fat in her vnwashed garments. And there are many fictions of the transforming into swine. Homer faineth that the companions of Vlisses were all by Circes turned into swine, which is interpreted in this manner; Circe to signifie vnreasonable pleasure, Vlisses to signifie the soule, and his companions the inferior affections thereof, and so were the companions of Vlisses turned into swine by Circe, When vnreasonable pleasures do ouercome our affecti∣ons and make vs like swine in following our appetites: and therefore it was the counsell of Socrates, that no man should at banquet eate more then sufficient, and those which could not abstaine from them, should forbeare their company that perswaded them to eat when they were not hungry, & to drinke when they were not thirsty, and therefore he supposed that it was said in iest that Circe turned men into swine. When as Vlisses by his owne absti∣nence and Mercury his counsell, was deliuered and saued from that most sauage transfor∣mation, which caused Horace thus to write; Vlisses si bibisset pocula Circes—Cum socijs Vixisset canis immundus vel amica luto sus. Xenophon And from this came the originall prouerbe of Porcellus Acarnanius for a tender and deli∣cate person, vsed so to fulnes, that al penury is death vnto him. Sweet sauours as we haue shewed already, are very hurtfull to swine, especially the sweet oyle of Marioram. Wher∣upon came the prouerb Nil cum amar acino sui, and Lucretius speaketh hereof in this sort; Deni{que} amaracinum fugitat sus & timet omne, Vnguentum: nam setigeris subus acre venenum est: And for this cause Tullius Cicero saith, Illi alablastrus putaet vnguenti plena. That is, A box of Alablaster full of oyntment is displeasing to this beast, for as the Scarabee or Horse fly forsaketh sweet places to light and sit vpon horse dung, euen so doth Swine. There be many of the aunci∣ents that haue deliuered merrily Anima suis prosate, that the Swines soule is in their body but in stead of salt to keepe the flesh from stinking, Coelius euen as for no other purpose many a∣mong men seem to liue and retaine soule in body. They are very clamorous, and there∣fore are vsed for talking and pratling fellowes, whereupon the Greeke Poet Lucilius tran∣slated by Erasmus alludeth, when he saith in this manner, vnder Alia Menecles alia porcellus loquitur ; Sucula, bos, & capra mih , periêre Menecles, Ac merces horum nomine pensa tibi est. Nec mihi cum Othryade quicquam estue fuit-ne negoci, Nec fures vllos huc cito Thermopylis. Sed contra Eutychidem nobis lis: proinde quid hic mi Aut Xerxes facit, aut quid Lacedaemonij? Ob pactum & de me loquere, aut clamauero clare, Multò aliud dicit sus, aliud Menecles. And to conclude, in Latin they say Sus mineruam, when an vnlearned dunce goeth about to teach his better or a more learned man, then doth the Hog teach Pallas, or as we say in English, the foule Sow teach the faire Lady to spin. There are in Swine many presages and foretokens of foule weather, as Swine-heardes haue obserued: as first if they lye long wallowing in the mire, or if they feed more greedi∣ly then they were accustomed, or gather together in their mouths, hay, stubble, or straw, as Aratus writeth; or if they leap and dance, or frisk in any vnwonted sort: and for their co∣pulation in yeares that will proue moyst, they will euer be boring, but in dryer years they are lesse libidinous. The greatest harm that commeth by Swine is in rooting and turning vp of the earth, and this they do in corn fields, for which we haue shewed that the Ciprians made a law to beat out the teeth of such Swine, for this cause Homer writeth that Irus threatneth Villisses, be∣cause his companions eate vp all his corne, to knocke out their teeth; yet sometimes the husbandmen admit them of purpose, both into their land before it bee plowed, and also into their vineyards. It is said that the Egyptians forbeare to sacrifice them, because they tread in their corne in their fields after it is swelled out of the earth, so as the Birds cannot gather it vp againe, as we haue shewed before. The Iewes and the Egyptians accounted this beast most vncleane. The Iewes not as the vaine gentiles imagined because they wor∣shipped it, for that it taught men to plow the earth, but for the law of God. And the E∣gyptians hold it a profaigne thing, and therefore they had an ancient law, that no Swyne-heard should come into their temple, or that any man should giue him his Daughter in marriage. It is very certaine that they were wont to be vsed in sacrifice. The said Egyp∣tians neuer sacrificed them but to the Moone and to Bacchus, and at other times it was vn∣lawfull, either to offer them, or to eate them: but it seemeth by many Authors that their first sacrifices were of Swyne, for we read of ancient customs in Hetruria, that at their mar∣riage feastes they offered and sacrificed a Sow to Venus, and at other times, especially in haruest they did so to Ceres. The Latines do hold a Swine very gratefull and sacred to Iupi∣ter, because as they beleeued that a Sow did first of all lend her paps to him, and therefore all of them worship a Sow, and abstaine from her flesh. Likewise in Mysia and Phoenicia, there were temples of Iupiter, wherein it was forbidden to sacrifice or kill Swyne by a pub∣like law, like as it was among the Iewes. When the Kings of Sparta were first of all chosen into that royall place, they were permitted to execute the priests office, and to the intent that they might neuer want sacrifices, there was a preuiledge graunted them to take a pig of euery Sow, and when they sacrificed to Iupiter a Swine, it must be after or at a tryumph: they were also sacrificed to Neptune, because they were impetuous and ranging beasts; & a Boare was holy to Mars, according to this saying of Pomponius in Attellana. Mars tibifac∣turū, si vnquā re ireo, bidente verre. And there was a custome among the Athenians when a man had slaine an hundred enimies, he was permitted to offer vp to Mars, some part of a man at Lemnos, and afterward they grew out of liking of this vaine custome, and in stead therof sacrificed a barrow or gelded hog, & when they housled their army, they did it with hogs, sheep, or Buls, and nothing else, and they compassed it about 3. times with pomp & stately procession, and at last slew and offered them to Mars. They were wont to sacrifice a hog for a man that had recouerd his wits after he had bin mad, and also they sacred Swyne to Siluanus, according to these verses; Caedere Siluano porcum quadrante lauari : And againe: Tellurem porco Siluanum lacte piabant. Their pagan God Terminus, had an Ewe and a young Sow offered to him (as Ouid writeth) although by the lawes of Numa, al sacrifice of liuing things were forbidden vnto him. To Ceres and Bacchus, we haue shewed already, how they were offered, and the reason of their sacrificing was, because they were hurtfull to all greene corne and vines; Ceres auida gauisa est de sanguine porci, Vlta suas merita caede nocentes opes, Nam sata vere n no teneris lactentia succis, Eruta setigerae comperit ore suis, And againe in another place he writeth thus: Prima putatur hostia Sus meruisse mori, —quia semina pando, Er verit rostro, sp n{que} interceperit anni. The time of their sacrificing to Ceres was in Aprill, wherein the priestes with Lamps and Torches, and apparelled in white garments, did first of all kill a female Swine, and then of∣fer her, and sometime this was a Sow with farrow, because thereby in a mistery they pray∣ed the fruitefulnesse and fecundity of the earth, and for these and such like causes we read of titles put vpon them, as Porca pracidanea, for the sow that was slaine before the reaping, and Porca praesa, for the sow that was offered at a funerall for the safety of all the family, wherein the dead man liued. They also sacrificed a barren sow to Proserpina, because shee neuer bore children, and to Iuno in the calends of euery month: And thus much for their sacrificing. Now we are to come to the vse of swine and their seuerall parts, first of all it is certaine that there is no beast lesse profitable being aliue then a hog, and yet at his latter end he payeth his maister for his keeping. Cicero said well Sus quid habet praeterescam, cui quidem ne putresceret, animam ipsam pro sale datam esse dicit Chrysippus. A hog hath nothing in him beside his meate, and that therefore the soule thereof was giuen to it in stead of salt to keepe it from stinking: for indeed in Lions, Dogs, Beares, Horsses, and Elephants, all their vertue lyeth in their minds, and their flesh is vnprofitable and good for nothing, but the Swine hath no gifts at all in the mind, but in the body, the life therof keeping the flesh and body from putrifaction. And there is no beast that God hath ordained for domestical prouision of food and meat to man, except Hares & conies, that is so fruitful as Swin are, Gillius God (as we haue touched already) Leuit. 11. Deut. 14. forbad his people of Israell to eate heereof, because it was an vncleane beast not chewing the cud; and furthermore the ob∣seruation of Procopius is memorable, that whereas the Egyptians did worship with diuine worship, both Oxen, Kyne, and sheep, and would not eat of their flesh or kill them in sa∣crifice, yet did eat, and kil, and sacrifice Swine. The Iewes were permitted and commaun∣ded to eat Oxen & sheep, and abstain from the flesh of Swine; thus manifesting how dif∣ferent his waies and thoughts are from the waies and thoughts of men. The Lord doth not this for pollicy, but to try the obedience of his people, placeth therin one part of his worship, and therefore by his prophets. Esa. 65. & 66. calleth the eating of Swines flesh abomination, and threatneth therunto a certaine vnauoydable iudgment and damnation. The woman and her seuen sons which were apprehended by King Antiochus, and by him tempted to eat swines flesh which they refused to do, (being against the law of their God) are remembred as most worthy Martyres of his Church, that endured, cutting off their hands and feete, pulling out their toong, and seething in a boyling caldron with other ex∣quisite torments incident to such death, as is recorded by Iason 2. Macab. 6. We read that Heliogabalus did abstaine from swines flesh, because he was a Phoenician, and they forbore to eate it. The women of Bracea in Affricke, do neuer tast of Cowes flesh or Swines flesh. The Arabian Scenites neuer eate hereof, and Swine cannot liue in their Countries ( Tesias and Aelianus affirme) that in India there are no Swine, either tame or wilde, and that the Indians do as much forbeare to eate of Swines flesh, in detestation thereof, as they do of mans flesh. Now concerning the flesh of Swine, diuers opinions are held about the goodnesse and euill thereof, yet Hippocrates writeth, that Porcinae carnes prauae sunt quum fuerint crudio∣res & ambustae, magis autem choleram generant, & turbationem faciunt, Suillae carnes optima sunt omnium carnium. That is, The flesh of a Boare being raw or roasted is worst of all o∣ther, because it engendereth Cholor and wilde windy matter in the stonlocke; but the flesh of a Sow is the best of al flesh, with this prouiso, that it neither exceed in fatnesse, lean¦nesse, or age. There is a merry and a witty answer of a memorable Noble Man to an old Gentlewo∣man (if not a Lady) who dispraised Bacon at the Noble Mans table, and said it was a chur∣lish, vnpleasant meate. The Lord vnderstanding a priuy Emphasis in that speech against himselfe, (for his name was written with those Letters and sillables) aunswered her; you say truth, if the Bacon be a piece of an old Sow, (as peraduenture she seemed to be at that time.) The best opinion about the concoctiue quality of this flesh is, that then it is best, when it is in middle age, neither a pig, nor an old Hogge, for a pigge is ouer moyst, like the Damme which is the moystest of all other earthly Beastes; and therefore cannot but engender much flegme: and for this cause the fattest are reprooued for a good diet, for that it cannot digest well through ouer much humidity. And the olde Swine are most hard of concoction, (yea though they bee scorched or senged at the fire) because therby is increased in their flesh much acrimony and sharp∣nesse, which in the stomacke of man turneth into Choler: for they bite all the vessels rea∣ching to the stomacke, making a deriuation of all those ill humours into the belly and o∣ther parts. I do not like their opinion, which thinke that it is better cold then hot, for feare of in∣flammation, this rule is good in the flesh of Goates (which are exceeding whot) but in Swyne where is no predominancy but of moysture, it is better to eate them hot then cold, euen as hot Milke is more wholesome then cold. Hippocrates doth prescribe the ea∣ting of Swynes flesh in the sicknesse of the Spleene; and Coelius Aurelianus, forbiddeth the same in the palsie or falling sicknesse. Galen is of opinion that Caro porcina potentissime nutrit : nourisheth most strongly, and potently; whereof hee giueth an instance for a reason taken from Champions, Comba∣tants, or Wrestlers, if the day before they Wrestle or fight, they feed on an equall quan∣tity of any other flesh, they feel themselues weak and feeble, in comparison of that is ga∣thered from Swyns flesh: and this (he saith) may be tryed in labourers, Myoners, Dig∣gers, and Husbandmen; which retaine their strength aswell (if not better) by eating of Swynes flesh or Bacon as any other meate: For as Beefe in thicknesse and solidity of substance to the eyes appearance, excelleth Porke or Bacon, so Porke and Bacon excel∣leth and is preferred before Beefe, for a clammy nourishing humour. And this compa∣rison betwixt Pork and Beefe, Galen amplyfieth farther in these wordes: Of Swines flesh, those are best for men in their middle and ripe age, which are of Hogges of aunswerable age, and to other which are but growing to a ripenesse and perfection, piggs, Sheates, and young growing Swyne, are most nourishable. And on the contrary, young grow∣ing Oxen are most nourishable to men of perfect yeares and strength, because an Oxe is of a far more dry temperament then a Hog. A Goate is lesse dry then an Oxe, and yet compared to a man or a Swyne, it excelleth both of them; for there is a great resemblance or similitude betwixt a mans flesh and Swines flesh, which some haue proued in tast, for they haue eaten of both at one Table, and could find no difference in one from the other: for some euill Inn-kepers and hoasts haue so deceiued men, which continued a great while, not descryed or punished, vntill at last the finger of a man was mixed therewith, and being found the Authours receiued their reward. Swines flesh also is lesse excrementall then pigges flesh, and therefore more nutrible; for the moyster that the flesh is, the sooner it is dispersed, and the vertue of it auoided, and olde swine notwithstanding their primitiue and naturall moisture, yet grow very dry, and their flesh is worst of al, because in nature, humidity helpeth the con∣coction thereof. All swines flesh being concocted engendereth many good humors, yet withal they ontaine a kind of glutinous humor, which stoppeth the liuer and reins, especially in those which by nature are apt to this infirmity: And althogh some are of opinion, that the wilde Bore is more norishable then the tame swine, because of his laborous course of life, and getting his prey; yet it appeareth that the tame swine by their resty life, and easie gathe∣ring of their meate, are made more fit for nourishment of man, for they are more moist: and swines flesh without conuenient moisture (which is many times wanting in wilde Bores) is poison to the stomacke, and yet for a man that hath propounded to himselfe a thin extenuating diet, I would wish him to forbeare both the one and the other, except he vse exercise, and then he may eat the eares, or the cheekes, or the feet, or the haslet, if they be well sod or dressed: prouided they be not fresh, but sauced or powdred; And it is no maruell that swines flesh shoulde so well agree with ours, for it is apparant that they liue in dirt, and loue to muddle in the same. And if any man aske how it commeth to passe, that swine which both feed and liue so filthily, should be so norishable to the nature of man; some make answere, that by reason of their good constitution of body, they turne ill nutriment to a good flesh: for as men which be of a sounde, perfect, and healthy disposition or temperature, are not hurt by a little euill meat, which is hard of digestion; euen so is it with well constituted and tempe∣red swine, by continuall feeding vpon euill things, they grow not onely to no harme, but also to a good estate, because nature in processe of time draweth good out of euill: But if men which haue moist stomackes, do eat of swines flesh, then do they suffer thereby great harme, for as water powred vpon wet ground, increaseth the dirt, so moistnes put vpon a moist stomacke, increaseth more feeblenesse: but if a man of a dry and moist stomack, do eate heereof, it is like rain falling into a dry ground, which begetteth and engendreth ma∣ny wholesome frutes and hearbes. And if a swine be fatted with dried figges or Nuts, it is much more wholesome. With wine all swines flesh is most nourishable, and therefore the vniuersity of Salernum, prescribed that in their verses to the king of England, and al∣so they commended their loynes and guts: Ilia porcorum bona sunt, mala sunt refequorum. And Fiera describeth the eating of Hogs-flesh in this manner: Sus tibi coenoso coena domesticus ore, Grata ferat nobis mensa hyemalis aprum. Ille licet currat de vertice montis, aquosae Carnis erit, pluri sed tamen aptacibo est. Hinc feritas siluae{que} domant, & inania saxa, Post melius posita rusticitate sapit. And whereas Hippocrates commended swines flesh for Champions or Combatants, it is certaine, that Bilis the Champion thorough eating of swines flesh, fell to such a heighth of choller, that he cast it vpwards and downwards. When the wombe of a woman is vlcerated, let her abstaine from all swines flesh, espe∣cially the eldest and the youngest. It is not good for any man to taste or eat this flesh in the Summer time, or any hot weather, for then onely it is allowed when extreame frostes haue tempered it for mans stomacke, and the stomacke for it: the flesh of wilde swine is most of all hurtfull to them that liue at ease, without exercise, because that they are im∣moderately giuen to sleepe. Some are of opinion that a sow which is killed immediatly af∣ter the Boare hath couered hir, is not so wholesome as other: Heliogabalus obserued this custome, to eat one day nothing but Phesant Hens, another day nothing but Pullen, and the third day nothing but porke. There was in auncient time a dish of meat called Troianus, the Troyan Hog, Erasmus Macrobius in imitati∣on of the Troyan horse, for as that was stuffed within with many armed men, so was this with many seuerall meats, and whole beasts, as Lambes, Birds, Capons, and such like, to serue the appetites of the most strange belly-Goddes, and Architects of gluttonny: and therefore Cincius in his oration, wherein he perswaded the senators and people to the law Fannia, reprooueth this immoderate riot in banquets, In apponendo mensis porcum Troia∣num, and indeed it wanted not effect, for they forbad both Porcum Troianum, and Callum aprugnum. There was another (Rauen-monster-dish, (called Pinax ) wherein were included ma∣ny Beasts, Fowles, Egges, and other things which were distributed whole to the guests, and no maruell, for this Beast was as great as a Hog, and yet gilded ouer with siluer. And Hippolochus in his Epistle to Lynceus, speaking of the banquet of Caramis, saith thus, Alla∣tus est nobis etiam porcus dimidia parte diligenter assus siue tostus, & dimidia altera parte tan∣quam ex aqua molliter èlixus, mira etiam coqui industria ita paratus, vt qua parte iugulatus esset, & quomodo varijs delicijs refertus eius venter non appareat. There was brought to vs a Hog, whereof the one halfe was wel rosted, and the other halfe or side wel sod, and this was so industriously prepared by the Cook, that it did not apeare where the hog was slain or receiued his deadly wounde, nor yet how his belly came to be stuffed with diuers and sundry excellent and delicate things. The Romans had a fashion to deuide and distribute a Hogge, obiscus which appeareth in these verses of Martiall : Iste tibi faciet bona saturnalia porcus, Inter spumantes ilice pastus apros. And of the eating of a sucking pigge, Martiall also writeth in this manner: Lacte mero pastum pigrae mihi matris alumnum Ponat, & Aetolo de sue diues edat. I might adde many other thinges concerning the eating and dressing of Swines flesh, both young and olde, but I will passe it ouer, leauing that learning to euery Cooke, and Kitchin-boy. Concerning Bacon, that which is cald by the Latins Perna, I might adde many things, neither improper, nor impertinent, & I canot tell whether it should be a fault to omit it in this place. The word Perna after Varro, seemeth to be deriued from Pede, but in my opini∣on, it is more consonant to reason, that it is deriued from the Greek word Pterna, which is the ribs and hips of the hogge, hanged vp and salted, called by Martiall Petaso, and by Plautus Ophthalmia, Horaeum, Scombrum, and Laridus : Palladius. Quanta pecus pestis veniet, quanta labes larido. The time of the making of Bacon, is in the winter season, and all the cold weather, and of this Martiall writeth very much in one place: Musteus est, propera, charos ne differ amicos Nam mihi cum vetulo sit pesatone nihil. And againe. Et pulpam dubio de petasone voras Cretana mihi fiet, vel massa licebit De menapis lauti, de petasone vorant. Strabo in his time commended the Bacon of the Gaules, or of France, affirming that it was not inferior to the Asian or Lycian, an old citty of Spaine (called Pompelon ) nere Aquitania, was also famous for Bacon. They first of all killed their hogs, and then burned or scalded of al their haire, & after a little season did slit them assunder in the middle, laying them vp∣on salt in some tub or deep trough, and there couering them al ouer with salt, with the skin vppermost, and so heap flitch vpon flitch, til al be salted, and then againe they often turnd the same, that euery part and side, might receiue his season; that is, after 5. daies, laying them vndermost which were vpermost, and those vpermost which were vndermost. Then after 12. daies salting, they tooke al out of the tub or trough, rubbing off from it al the salt, and so hanged it vp two daies in the winde, and the third day they all to anoint it with oile, and did hange it vp two daies more in the smoke; and afterward take it downe againe, and hange it or lay it vppe in the larder, where all the meat is preserued, still looking warily vn¦to it, to preserue it from mice and Wormes: And thus much shall suffice at this time for the flesh of Hogges, both Porke and Bacon. The milk of a sow is fat and thick, very apt to congeal, & needeth not any runnet to turne it; it breedeth little whay, and therefore it is not fit for the stomacke, except to procure vomiting, & because it hath bin often proued, that they which drink or eat sow milk fal into scurffes and Leprosies, (which diseases the Asians hate aboue all other) therefore the E∣gyptians added this to all the residue of their reasons, to condemne a sow for an vnclean and filthy beast: And this was peculiarly the saying of Manethon. With the skinnes of swine which the Graecians did call Phorine, The vse of their skins they made shoo-lea∣ther, but now a daies by reason of the tendernesse and loosenesse thereof, they vse it not, but leaue it to the sadlers & to them that couer bookes, for which cause it is much better then eyther sheepe or Goates skinnes, for it hath a deeper graine, and doeth not so easily fall off. Out of the parings of their skinnes they make a kind of glew, which is preferred before Taurocollum, and which for similitude they call Choerocollum. The fat of swine is ve∣ry precious to lickor shooes and bootes therewithall. The amber that is in common vse groweth rough, rude, impolished, and without clearenesse, but after that it is sod in the greace of a sow that giueth sucke, it getteth that nitour and shining beauty, which we find to be in it. Some mixe the blood of Hogges with those medicines that they cast into Waters to take fishes, and the hunters in some Countries when they would take Wolues and Foxes do make a traine with a Hogges liuer sodde, cut in pieces and annointed ouer with hony, and so annointing their shoos with swines grease, draw after them a dead catte, which will cause the beasts to follow after very speedily. The haires of swine, are vsed by Cobblers and Shoomakers, and also with them euery Boy knoweth how to make their nosebleede. The dung is very sharpe, and yet is it iustly condemned by Columella for no vse, no not to fatten the earth, and Vines also are burned therewithal, except they be diligently watred, or rest fiue yeares without stirring. In Plinies time they studied to enlarge and make their Luttuce grow broad, Theophrast. and not close together, which they did by slitting a little the stalke, and thrusting gently into it some Hogs dung. But for trees there is more especial vse of it, for it is vsed to ripen fruit and make the trees more plentifull. The Pomegranats and Almondes are sweetned her ¦by, and the Nuts easily caused to fall out of the shell. Likewise, if Fennel be vnsauourie, by laying to the root thereof eyther Hogs-dung, or Pigeons dung, it may be cured; and when any Apple tree is affected and razed with wormes, by taking of Swines dung, mixed and made soft like morter with the vrine of a man layed vnto the root, it is recouered, and the wormes driuen away: and if there bee any rentes or stripes visible vppon trees, so as they are endangered to be lost thereby, they are cured by applying vnto the stripes and wounds this dung of Swine. When the Apple trees are loose, poure vpon their roots the stale of Swine, and it shall establish and settle them, and wheresoeuer there are swine kept, there it is not good to keepe or lodge horses, for their smell, breath, and voice, is hatefull to all magnanimious and perfect spirited horsses. And thus much in this place concerning the vse of the seue∣rall parts of swine, whereunto I may adde our English experiments, that if swine be suffe∣red to come into Orchards, and digge vp and about the roots of the Apple trees, keeping the ground bare vnder them, and open with their noses, the benefit that will arise thereby to your increase of frute will be verie inestimable. And heere to saue my selfe of a labor a∣bout our English Hogges, I will describe their vsage out of Maister Tussers husbandry, Tus. husb. in his own words, as followeth: and first of al for their breeding in the spring of the yeare he writeth in generall: Let Lent well kept offend not thee, For March and Aprill breeders be. And of September he writeth thus: To gather some mast it shall stand thee vpon, With seruant and children yer mast be all gone. Some left among bushes shall pleasure thy Swine, For feare of a mischiefe keepe Acornes fro kine. For rooting of pasture ring hog ye haue neede, Which being well ringled, the better doth feed. Though young with their elders will lightly keepe best, Yet spare not to ringle both great and the rest. Yoke sildome thy swine, while shacke time doth last, For diuers misfortunes that happen too fast. Or if you do fancy, whole eare of the Hogge, Giue eare to ill neighbor, and eare to his Dogge. Keepe hog I aduise thee from meddow and Corne, For out alowd crying, that ere he was borne. Such lawlesse so haunting both often and long, If Dog set him chaunting, he doth thee no wrong. And againe in Octobers husbandry he writeth: Though plenty of Acornes, the Porkelings to fat, Not taken in season may perish by that. If ratling or swelling get once in the throat, Thou loosest thy porkling a Crowne to a groat. What euer thing fat is, againe if it fall, Thou venterest the thing and the fatnesse withall. The fatter, the better, to sell or to kill, But not to continue, make proofe if you wil. In Nouem. he writeth again Let hog once fat, loose none of that, When mast is gone, Hogge falleth anon, Still fat vp some, till Shroue-tide come, Now Porke and sowce beares taske in a house. Thus farre of our English husbandry about swine: Now followeth their diseases in parti∣cular. Of the diseases of swine. HEmlocke is the bane of Panthers, Swine, wolues, and all other beasts that liue vp∣on deuouring of flesh, for the hunters mix it with flesh, and so spreading or casting the flesh so poysoned abroad in bits or morsels to be deuoured by them. The root of the white Chamaelion mixed with fryed Barly-floure. Water and oyle is also poison to swine. Pliny. Aelianus. The blacke Ellebor worketh the same effect vppon horses, Oxen, and swine, and therefore when the beasts do eat the white, they forbeare the blacke with all wearisome∣nesse. Likewise Hen-bane worketh many strange and painfull conuulsions in their bellies; therefore when they perceiue that they haue eaten thereof, they run to the waters & ga∣ther snailes or sea-crabs, by vertue whereof they escape death, and are againe restored to their health. The hearb Goose foot is venemous to swine, and also to Bees, and therefore they will neuer light vpon it, or touch it. The blacke night-shade is present destruction vnto them, and they abstaine from Harts tongue, and the great bur, by some certaine in∣stinct of nature, if they be bitten by any Serpents, Sea-crabs, or Snailes, & the most pre∣sent remedy that nature hath taught them. The swine of Scythia by the relation of Pliny & Aristotle, are not hurt with any poison except Scorpions, and therefore so soone as euer they are stung by a scorpion, they die if they drink: and thus much for the poison of swine. Against the cold (of which these beastes are most impatient:) the best remedy is to make them warm sties, for if it be once taken, it will cleane faster to them, then any good thing, and the nature of this beast is, neuer to eate if once he feele himselfe sicke, and therefore the diligent maister or keeper of swine, must vigilantly regard the beginnings of their di∣seases, which cannot be more euidently demonstrated, then by forbearing of their meat. Of the Measils. The Measilles are called in Greeke Chalaza, in Latine Grandines, for that they are like haile-stones spred in the flesh, and especialy in the leaner part of the hog, and this disease as Aristotle writeth, is proper to this beast, for no other in the world is troubled herwith: for this cause the Graecians call a Measily hog Chaluros, and it maketh theyr flesh verye loose and soft. The Germaines call this disease Finnen, and Pfinnen, the Italians Gremme, the French ursume, because the spots appeare at the root of the tongue like white seeds, and therefore it is vsuall in the buying of hogges in all Nations to pull out their tongue and looke for the Measils, for if there appeare but one vpon his tongue, it is certaine that all the whole body is infected. And yet the Butchers do all affirme, that the cleanest hog of al, hath three of these, but they neuer hurt the swine or his flesh, and the swine may be full of them, and yet none appeare vpon his tongue, but then his voice will be altered and not be as it was wont. These abound most of all in such Hogs as haue fleshy legs and shoulders very moyst, and they be not ouer plentifull, they make the flesh the sweeter, but if they abound, it ta∣steth like stocke-fish or meat ouer watered. If there be no appearance of these vpon their tongue, then the chap-man or buyer pulleth of a bristle from the backe, and if blood fol∣low, it is certaine that the Beast is infected, and also such cannot well stand vppon theyr hinder legs. Their taile is very round. For remedy hereof diuers daies before their killing they put into their wash or swill some ashes, especially of Hasell trees. But in France and Germany it is not lawfull to sel such a Hogge, and therefore the poore people do onely eat them. Howbeit they cannot but engender euill humours and naughty blood in the body. The rootes of the bramble called Ramme, beaten to powder and cast into the holes, where swine vse to bath themselues, do keepe them cleare from many of these diseases, and for this cause also in ancient time they gaue them Horse-flesh sodden, and Toads sodden in water, to drinke the broath of them. The Burre pulled out of the earth without yron, is good also for them, if it be stamped and put into milk, and so giuen them in their wash. They giue their Hogges heere in Englande red-lead, red-Oker, and in some places red-loame or earth. And Pliny saith, that he or she which gathereth the aforesaid Burre, must say this charme: Haec est herba argemon Quam minerua reperit Suibas his remedium Qui de illa gustauerint. At this daie there is great-praise of Maiden-haire for the recouery of swine, also holy Thi∣stle, and the root of Gunhan and Harts tongue. Of leannesse or pyning. SOmetime the whole heard of swine falleth into leannes, and so forsake their meat, yea although they be brought forth into the fielde to feede, yet as if they were drunke or weary they lie downe and sleepe all the day long. For cure whereof, they must be closely shutte vp into a warme place, and made to fast one whole day from meat and water, and then giue them the roots of wilde Cucumber beaten to powder, and mixed with Water, let them drinke it, and afterward giue them beanes pulse, or any drie meat to eat, and last∣lie warme water to procure vomit, as in men, whereby their stomackes are emptyed of al thinges both good and bad, and this remedy is prescribed against all incertaine diseases, the cause whereof cannot be discerned, and some in such cases doe cut off the tops of the tailes, or their eares, for there is no other vse of letting these beastes bloode in theyr vaines. Of the Pestilence. THese beasts are also subiect to the Pestilence by reason of earth-quakes & sudden in∣fections in the aire, and in such affection the beast hath sometime certaine bunches or swellings about the necke, then let them be seperated, and giue them to drinke in water the roots of Daffadill: Quatit agros tussis anhela sues Ac faucibus angit obesis tempore pestis. Some giue them night shade of the wood, which hath great stalkes like cherry twiggs, the leaues to be eaten by them against all their hot diseases, and also burned snailes or Pepper∣woort of the Garden, or Lactuca foetida cut in peeces, sodden in water, and put into their meate. Of the Ague. IN auncient time ( Varro saith) that when a man bought a Hogge, he couenaunted with the seller, that it was free from sicknes, from danger, that he might buy it lawfully, that it had no maunge or Ague. The signes of an Ague in this beast are these. WHen they stop suddenly, standing stil, and turning their heads about, fal downe as it were by a Megrim, then you must diligently marke their heads which way they turne them, that you may let them bloode on the contrary eare, and like∣wise vnder their taile, some two fingers from their buttockes, where you shall finde a large veine fitted for that purpose, which first of all we must beat with a rodde or peece of wood, that by the often striking it may be made to swell, and afterwardes open the saide veine with a knife: the blood being taken away, their taile must be bound vp with Osier or Elme twigges, and then the swine must be kept in the house a day or two, being fed with Barly meale, and receiuing warme water to drinke as much as they will. Of the Crampe. VVHen swine fall from a great heat into a sudden colde, which hapneth when in their trauel they suddenly lie downe through wearinesse, they fall to haue the Crampe, by a painefull convulsion of their members, and the best remedye thereof, is for to driue them vp and downe, till they wax warme againe, and as hot as they were before, and then let them bee kept warme stil, and coole at great leisure, as a horsse doth by walking, otherwise they perish vnrecouerably, like Calues which neuer liue after they once haue the crampe. Of Lice. THey are many times so infested and annoied with lice, that their skinne is eaten and gnawne through thereby; for remedy whereof, some annoint them with a confe∣ction made of Cream, Butter, and a great deale of salt: Others again, annoint them after they haue washed them all ouer with the Leeze of wine, and in England commonly the country people vse staues-aker, red-Oaker, and grease. Of the Lefragey. BY reason that they are giuen much to sleepe in the summer time, they fall into Lethar∣gies, and die of the same: the remedy whereof is, to keepe them from sleepe, and to Wake them whensoeuer you finde them asleepe. Of the head-aches. THis disease is cald by the Graecians ( Scotomia ) and Kraura, and by Albertus, Fraretis, herewith all swine are many times infected, and their eares fall downe, their eies are also deiected, by reason of many cold humors gathered together in their head, whereof they die in multitudes, as they do of the pestilence, and this sickenesse is fatal vnto them, if they be not holpen within three or foure daies. The remedie whereof (if their be anie at al) is to hold Wine to their Nostrils, first making them to smel thereof, and then rubbing it hard with it, and some giue them also the roots of white Thistle, cut smal and beaten into their meat, but if it fall out that in this paine they loose one of their eies, it is a signe that the beast wil die by and by after (as Pliny and Aristotle write.) Of the gargarisme. This disease is called by the Latins Raucelo, and by the Graecians Brancos, which is a swel∣ling about their chaps, ioyned with Feauer and Head-ach, spredding it selfe all ouer the throat, like as the squinancy doth in a man, and many times it begetteth that also in the swine, which may be knowne by the often moouing of their feet, and then they dy with in three daies, for the beast cannot eat being so affected, and the disease creepeth by lit∣tle and little to the liuer, which when it hath touched it, the beast dieth, because it putri∣fieth as it passeth. For remedy hereof, giue vnto the beast those things which a man recei∣ueth against the squinancy, and also let him blood in the root of his tongue, (I mean in the veine vnder the tongue) bathing his throate with a great deale of hot Water mixed with Brimstone and salt. This disease in hogges, is not knowne from that which is called Struma, or the Kinges euill at the first appearance, as Aristotle and Pliny write: the beginning of this disease is in the Almonds, or kernels of the throate, and it is caused through the corruption of water which they drinke, for the cure wherof they let them bloud, as in the former disease, and they giue them the yarrow with the broadest leaues. There is a hearbe called Herba impia, all hoary, and outwardly it looketh like Rosemary, some say it is so called because no beast will touch it, this being beaten in peeces betwixt two tiles or stones, groweth marueilous hot, the iuyce thereof being mixed in milke and Wine, and so giuen vnto the Swyne to drink, cureth them of this disease, and if they drinke it before they be affected therewith, they neuer fal into it, and the like is attributed to the hearb Trimity, and Viola Martia, like∣wise the blew flowers of Violets are commended for this purpose by Dioscorides. Of the kernels. THese are little bunches rising in the throate, which are to bee cured by letting bloud in the shoulder, and vnto this disease belongeth that which the Germans cal Rangen, and the Italians Sidor, which is not contagious, but very dangerous, for within two daies the beast doth dye thereof, if it bee not preuented: this euill groweth in the lower part or chap of the swines mouth, where it doth not swel, but waxing white, hardeneth like a peece of horne, through paine whereof the beast cannot eate, for it is in the space betwixt the sore and hinder teeth, the remedy is to open the Swines mouth as wide as one can, by thrusting into it a round bat, then thrust a sharp needle through the same sore, and lifting it vp from the gum, they cut it off with a sharp knife, and this remedy helpeth many if it be taken in time, some giue vnto them the roots of a kind of Gention to drinke, as a speciall medicine, which the Germans for that cause cal Rangen crute, but the most sure way is the cutting it off, and like vnto this there is such another growing in the vpper chappe of the mouth, and to be cured by the same remedy; the cause of both doth arise from eating of their meate ouer hot, and therefore the good Swineheard must labour to auoid that mis∣chiefe, the mischiefe of this is described by Virgill: Hinc canibus blandis rabies venit, & quatit aegros, Tussis anhela sues, as faucibus angit abesis. Of the paine in their lunges. FOr all maner of pain in their lungs, which come by the most part from want of drink, are to haue lung-wort stamped, and giuen them to drinke in water, or else to haue it tyed vnder their tongues two or three daies together, or that which is more probable, because it is dangerous to take it inwardly, to make a hole in the eare, and to thrust it into the same, tying it fast for falling out, and the same vertue hath the roote of the white Hel∣libor, but the diseases of the lunges are not very dangerous, and therefore the Butchers saith, that you shall sildome find a Swyne with sound lungs or Liuers: sometime it falleth out that in the lightes of this beast there wil be apparant certain white spots as big as halfe a Wallnut, but without danger to the beast, sometimes the lightes cleaue to the ribs and and sides of the beast, for remedy whereof you must giue them the same medicines, that you giue vnto Oxen in the same disease. Sometimes there appeare certaine blathers in the liuer of water, which are called water-gals, sometimes this is troubled with vomiting, and then it is good to giue them in the morning, fryed pease mingled with dust of Iuory, and brused salt fasting, before they go to their pastures. Of the diseases in the Spleene. BY reason that this is a deuouring beast, and through want of Water, it is many times sicke of the Spleene, for the cure whereof you must giue them Prewnes of Tameriske pressed into water, to be drunke by them when they are a thirst, this disease commeth for the most part in the summer, when they eat of sweet and greene fruites, according to this verse; Strata iacent passim, seuia quae{que} sub arbore porna. The vertue of these Prewnes of Tameriske is also very profitable agaynst the diseases of the Melte, and therefore it is to be giuen to men as well as to Beastes, for if they do but drinke out of pots and cups made out of the wood of the tree Tameriske, they are easily cleared from all diseases of the Spleene: and therefore in some Countries of this great tree they make hog-troughes and mangers, for the safegard of their beastes, and where they grow not great, they make pots and cups. And if a Hog do eat of this Ta∣meriske but nine daies together, at his death hee shall be found to bee without a Spleene, (as Marcellus writeth.) When they become loose in their bellies, which happeneth to them in the spring time by eating of greene Hearbes, they either fall to bee leane, or else to dye, when they cannot easily make water, by reason of some stoppage, or sharpnesse of Vrin, they may be eased by giuing vnto them spurge-seed. And thus much for the dis∣eases of Swine. For conclusion whereof I will adde heereunto the length of a Swynes life, according to Aristotle and Pliny, if it be not cut off by sicknesse or violent death; for in their daies they obserued that Swyne did liue ordinarily to fifteene yeares, and some of them to twenty: And thus much for the natvre of Swyne in generall. The medicines of the Hogge. The best remedy for the bitings of venomous Serpents is certainly beleeued to be this, to take some little creatures, A us as pigs, Cocks, Kyds, or Lambes, and teare them in pieces, applying them whiles they are hot to the wound as soone as it is made, for they will not only expell away the poyson, but also make the wound both whole and sound. For the cu∣ring of Horsses which are troubled with the inflammation of the lungs. Take a sucking pig and kill him neare vnto the sicke horse, that you may instantly poure the blood thereof in∣to his iawes, and it wil proue a very quick and speedy remedy. The panch of a sucking pig being taken out and mingled with the yolke which sticketh to the inner parts of the skin, Marcellus and moystned both together, doth very much ease the paine of the teeth being poured into that eare, n which side the griefe shall lye. The liquor of swines flesh being boiled, doth very much help against the Buprestis. The same is also a very good antidote against poyson, and very much helpeth those which are troubled with the gout. Cheese made of Cowes milke being very old, so that it can scarce be eaten for tartnesse, being in the liquor or decoction of Swines flesh which is old and salt, and afterwardes throughly tempered, doth very much mollifie the stifnesse of the ioynts, being well applyed thereunto. The Indians vse to wash the wounds of the Elephantes which they haue taken first with hot water, ianus afterwards if they see them to be somewhat deepe, they annointed them with butter: then do they asswage the inflammation thereof, by rubbing of Swynes flesh vpon them, being whot and moyst with the fresh blood issuing from the same. For the healing of the wounds of Elephants, butter is chiefely commended, for it doth easily expell the iron lyrage hid therein, but for the curing of the vlcers, there is nothing, comparable to the flesh of swine. The blood of swine is moyst, and not very hot, being in temper most like vnto mans blood, therefore whosoeuer saith that the blood of men is profitable for any disease, he may first approue the same in swines blood: but if it shew not the same, it may in a manner shew the like action. Galen For although it be somewhat inferior vnto mans blood, yet at the least it is like vnto it; by knowledge whereof, wee hope wee shall bring by the vse thereof, more full and ample profit vnto men. For although it do not fully answer to our expectation, notwithstanding there is no such great neede that we should proue mens blood. For the encouraging of a feeble or diminished Horsse, Eumelus reporteth, the flesh of swine being hot, mingled in wine, and giuen in drinke, to be exceeding good and profitable. There also ariseth by Swyne another excellent medicine against diuers perillous diseases, which is this; to kill a young gelded Boare-pig, hauing red haires, and being of a very good strength, r cei∣uing the fresh blood in a pot, and to stir it vppe and downe a great while together with a sticke made of red Iuniper, casting out the clots of the blood, being gathered while it is stirring. Then to cast in the scrapings of the same Iuniper, and stir the berries of the Iuniper in the same to the quantity of seuen and twenty, but in the stirring of the same, let the clotes be stil cast out. Afterwards mingle with the same these hearbs following, Agrimony, Rue, Phu, Scabious, Betony, Pimpernell, Succory, Parsly, of each a handfull. But if the mea∣sure of the bloud exceed three pintes, put vnto it two ounces of Treacle: but if it shall be bigger, for the quantity of the bloud you shall diminish the measure of the Treacle(. But all things ought to be so prepared that they may be put to the bloud comming hot from the Bore.) These being mixed altogether, you must draw forth a dropping liquor, which you must dry in the sun, being diligently kept in a glasse-vessell for eight daies together, which you must do once euery yeare for it will last twenty yeares. This medicine is mani∣festly known to be a great preseruatiue against these diseases following, namely the plague, impostumes in the head, sides, or ribs, as also all diseases whatsoeuer in the lungs, the in∣flammation of the melt, corrupt or putrified bloud, the ague, swellings in the body, sha∣king of the heart, the dropsie, heate in the body aboue nature, euill humors, but the prin∣cipallest and chiefest vertue thereof is in curing all poisons, and such as are troubled with a noysome or pestilent feauer. Let him therefore who is troubled with any of the aforesaid diseases, drinke euery mor∣ning a spoonefull, or foure or fiue drops of the same liquor, and sweate vppon the same, and it will in very short time perfectly cure him of his paine. Some also do vse Almonds pounded or beaten in the bloud against the plague, the liquor being extracted forth by the force of fire. A young pig being killed with a knife, hauing his bloud put vpon that part of the body of any one which is troubled with warts, being as yet hot come from him, will presently dry them, and being after washed, wil quite expel them away. Marcellus The blood of a Sow which hath once pigged being annoynted vpon Women, cureth many diseases in them. The braines of a Boare or Sow being annointed vppon the sores or Carbuncles of the priuy members, doth very effectually cure them, the same effect also hath the blood of a hog. The dugs of of a woman anointed round about with the bloud of a sow, Pliny will decrease lesse and lesse. A young pig being cut in pieces, and the bloud thereof anointed vppon a Womans dugs, will make them that they shall not encrease. Concerning the grease of swine, it is tearmed diuersly of all the Authors, for the Graecians call it Stear Coirion, and Oxungion, for the imitation of the Latine word Axungia: but Marcellus also applyeth Ax∣ungia to the fat of other creatures, which among the auncient Authors I do not find: for in our time those which in Latine, do call that fat Axungia, which encreaseth more solid betweene the skinne and the flesh, in a hog, a man, a Brocke or Badger, a Dor-mouse, a Mountain-mouse, and such like. The fat of swine they commonly cal Lard which groweth betwixt the skin and the flesh, in expressing the vertues of this, we will first of al shew how∣it is to be applied to cewers outwardly, and then how it is to be receiued inwardly, next vn∣to butter, it hath the chiefest commendations among the ancients, and therefore they in∣uented to keepe it long, which they did by casting some salt among it, neither is the reason of the force of it obscure or vncertaine, for as it feedeth vpon many wholesome hearbes which are medicinable, so doth it yeald from them many vertuous opperations, and be∣sides the physick of it, it was a custome for new married wiues when they first of all ente∣red into their husbands house, to anoint the postes thereof with swines greace in token of their fruitfulnesse while they were aliue, and remainder of their good workes when they should be dead. The Apothecaries for preparation of certaine ointments, do geld a male sucking pig, especially such a one as is red, and take from his raines or belly certain fat, whith the Ger∣mans call Schmaer, and the French Oing, that is, Vnguentum, the husbandmen vse Swynes grease to annoint the axe trees of their carts and carriages, and for want thereof they take putryfied Butter, and in some countries the gum that runneth out of pine trees, and Fer trees, with the scum of Butter mingled together, and this composition taketh away scabs and tetters in men, but it is to be remembred that this greace must bee fresh, and not sal∣ted, for of salt grease there is no vse, but to skovver those thinges that are not exulcera∣ted. The auncientes deemed that this is the best Greace vvhich vvas taken from the raines of the Hog washed in raine water, the vaines being pulled out of it, and afterwards boyled in a new earthen pot, and so preserued. The fat of Swine is not so hot and dry as the fat of other beastes, the cheefe vse of it is to moysten, to fasten, to purge, and to scat∣ter, and heerein it is most excellent when it hath beene washed in Wine, for the stale salt Grease so mixed with wine, is profitable to annoint those that haue the pleurifie, and mingled with ashes and Pitch, easeth inflammations, fistulaies, and tumours, and the same vertue is ascribed to the fat of Foxes, except that their fat is hotter then the Swynes, and lesse moyst: likewise ashes of Vines mingled with stale grease of Hogs, cureth the wounds of Scorpions and Dogs, and with the spume of Nitre, it hath the same vertue against the biting of Dogges. It is vsed also against the French disease, (called the French Poxe,) for they say if the kneese of a man bee annointed therewith, and he stand gaping ouer it, it will draw a filthy matter out of his stomacke, and make him vomit. By Serenus it is prescribed, to be annointed vpon the kneese, against the stifnesse of the Necke. Mingled with Quick siluer and Brimstone, it is sufferant against the itch and scabs. This Lard being sod with the fat, and applyed to the body, doth mightily expell corrup∣tions that cleaue to the skin. The fat of Swyne with Butter and Oyle of Roses, is instilled into the broken skinnes of the braine for the cure of them. Likewise Buglosse plucked vp by the roote, and the rootes cut off, and curiosly wash∣ed, beaten and pounded into a ball, and mixed with Swynes greace, is good to be layed to any incurable wound. It is also profitable for the wounded Nerues of the body, bea∣ten together with Wormes of the earth, according to these verses of Serenus : Terrae lumbricos inretritos, Queis vetus & ranis sociari exungia debet. When bones are broken, if they be annointed with the sod greace of Swine, and so bound vp fast together, after they be well set and closed, grow wonderfull fast, sure, and solide againe. Serenus writeth thus of it; Si cui forte lapis teneros violauerit artus, Necte aedipes vetulos, & tritam chamaecisson. By this fat, (he meaneth the fat of Swyne) because presently after he maketh mention of the dung of Swyne to be good for the same cure. Being mingled with pitch, it scattereth all bunches and fellons. The hardnesse of the breasts, ruptures, conuulsions, & Cramps, and with whit Helsibor, it closeth vp clifts and chinks, in the flesh, & maketh the hard skin to be soft againe. It is very profitable against inflamations of vlcers, especially the fat of the boare pig, mixed with liquid gum. Women do also vse the fat of a Sow that neuer bore pig to cleare their skinne, and to mixe it with pitch, and one third part of Asse-grease against the scabs. The same mixed with white Lead, and the spume of siluer maketh the scares of the body to be of the same colour with the residue; and with Sulphur, it taketh away the spots in the Nailes, mingled with the powder of Acornes: if the greace bee salt, it softneth the hardnesse of the flesh. Rue mixed with Swines sewet or Buls-greace, taketh away spottes and freckles out of the face, and it is also profitable against the Kings euell, being mixed with the powder of a sea Oyster-shell, and being annointed in a bath, it taketh away the itch and blisters. Feather∣few and stale swines greace, is also prescribed against the Kings euill. This same alone or with snow, easeth the paine of burnings in the flesh, and when there is an vlcer, by reason of the burning, mixe it with tosted barly and the white of an Egge, according to these ver∣ses; Combustis igni, Hordea vel friges at{que} oui candida iunges, Ad sit adeps porcae mira est nam forma medelae, Iunge chelidonias ac sic line vulnera succis, Quod{que} recens vssit glacies axungia simplex, Mulcet & ex facili grata est medicamina cura. Fresh grease is very profitable for those members that are surboted or riuen of their skin, and likewise to anoint them that are weary with long iournies. The ashes of womens haire burned in a shell, and mingled with the fat of Swine, are said to ease the paine of S. Antho∣nies fire, and to stanch bloud, and to cure ring-wormes. The gall of a Swine, or of a Bore, and the lights with the fat, filleth vp the ibes, and the stalkes of Cabiges with the rootes burned, and mingled with Swines grease being applyed to the sides, doe cure the daily paines thereof: And thus far of the vse of this grease for the bodies of men. Now also it followeth in a word to touch the vse thereof for the bodies of beasts. When the hornes of Oxen or Kine are broken, they take a little Lint, Salt, Vineger, and Oyle, and lay them vpon the broken horne, pouring in the liquid, and binding the rest close on the outside, and this they renew three daies together. The fourth day they take the like quantity of swines grease, and liquid pitch, and with a smooth rind or barke of pine they binde it too close, and so it is fastened againe. When the hoofe or ancles of an Oxe are hurt with the plough share, then take hard pitch, swines grease, and Sulphur, roul them vp altogether in vnwashed wooll, and with a hot burning Iron melt them vpon the wound or horne. The eares of Dogges in the summer time are exulcerated by flyes, into the which sores it is good to instill liquid pitch sod with swines greace, and this medicine also is good to deliuer beastes from the tickes, for they fall off as many as touch it. When Lambes or Kyds are troubled with the Sheepe pox, some vse to annoint them with Swines grease and the rust of Iron, that is two partes of Swynes greace, and one part of rust, and so warme them together. Also for the scabs vppon Horsses heeles, that are called the scratches, which come for the most part in the Winter time, they cure them on this manner. They take the fat of Swyne, and melt it on the fire, and poure it into cold Water, which after∣wardes they take it out and beate it well together, at last they mingle it with Brimstone beaten small, and so annoint the place therewith three dayes together, and the third day they open the scabs, and so continue annoynting till it be cured. When a Horsse cannot hold his Neck right, it is good to anoynt him with Oyle, wine, Honny, and Hogges-greace, the manner of some Leeches is, when they haue made a suppuration by Oxen in burning, they first of all wash it with stale Vrine, and afterwardes mingle an equall quantity of pitch and Hogs greace together, wherewithall they annoint and cure the sore. Sometine the blood of Oxen falleth downe into their feete, wherein it congealeth and breaketh forth into scabbes, then must the place first of all be scraped with a knife, and the scabs cut away, afterwardes with cloathes wet in Vineger, Salt, and Oyle, moystened and pressed hard, and last of all by an equall quantity of Hogs-Greace, & Goats sewet sod both together, it will be cured by laying it vnto it. And thus much for the remedies of Swines greace towards beastes. The huskes of Beanes being beaten small to powder, and mixed with swines greace, is very profitable against the paine of the hippes, and the Nerues. Some Physitians take the greace of Swine, the fat of Geese, the sewet of Bulles, and the Oesypus or sweat of sheepe, and annoint therewithall gouty Legges, but if the paine remoue not, then doe they adde vnto it Waxe, Mirtle, Gum, and Pitch, and some vse it mixed with old Oyle, with the stone Sarcephagys, sinck-foyle beaten in wine with lime or ashes. This swines greace beaten in water with cumin, is prescribed by Simeon Sethi against the gout. It remedieth the falling of the haire, and the paine in the heads of women, ming∣led with one forth part of gals, and the like vertue it hath with wilde Roses, Lingulaca and Hippocampinus with Nitre and vineger. When the corners of ones eies are troubled with wormes, by annoynting them with the fat of a Sow with pig, beating them together both within and without, you shall draw all the Wormes out of his eyes. When one hath paine in his eares whereby matter yssueth forth, let him beate the old∣est Lard he can in a Morter, and rake the iuyce thereof in fine wooll, then let him put that wooll into his eare, making it to worke through warme water, and then infuse a little more of the iuyce of that Lard, and so shall he worke a great cure in short time. And generally the fatte of Geese, Hennes, Swine, and Foxes, are prepared for all the paynes in the eares. If there arise any bunch in the Necke or throate, seeth Lard and Wine together, and so by gargarising that Lyquor, it shall bee dispersed, according to the verses of Se∣renus : Inrigore ceruicis geminus mulcebitur vnguine poples, Hinc longam paritur neruos medicina sequetur. And it is no maruaile that the vertue of this should go from the knees to the Nerues, see∣ing that Pliny affirmeth, that from the anointing of the knees the sauour goeth into the stomack, ther is so great affinity or operation of Rue vpon the stones, that in ancient time they were wont to cure burstnesse by annoynting the cods with wilde Rue and Swynes Greace. Also this Greace with rust of Iron, is good against all the imperfectious in the seate. Butter, Goose-greace, and Hogges-greace, are indifferently vsed for this infirmity. Al∣so this is vsed to keepe Women from abortementes that are subiect thereunto, being ap∣plyed like an eye-salue. In the diseases of the matrix, especially Vlcers, they first of all dip Spuuges or Wooll in warme Water, and so clense the places infected, and afterwards cure it with Rozen and Swynes Grease, mingled together, and often vsing it in the day and night by way of an oyntmnet: but if the exulceration be vehement, after the washing they put Honny vnto the former confection, and some make a p fume with Goats Horne, Galles, Swynes Greace, and Gumme of Cedars. And. Fernerius saith, that Lard cut small and beate in a Morter of stone like paast, in a Limbecke of Glasse, rende∣reth a white Water, which maketh the haire yellow, and also the face comely. If a man be poysoned with Hemlocke hee cannot auoyde it better, then by drinking salt, Wine, and fresh Greace. A decoction heereof is good against the poyson of Beuprestis, and against Quickesiluer. The sewet of a Sowe fed with greene Hearbes, is profitable to them that are sicke of a consumption of the lunges, according to this verse of Se∣renus ; Porderit & veteris saeui pila sumpta suilli. This may also be giuen them in Wine, either raw or decocted, or else in pilles to be swal∣lowed downe whole if it be not salted, and the fift day after they prescribe them to drinke out of an Egge-shell Liquid Pitch, binding their sides, breasts, and shoulder bones very hard. It is also vsed for an old Cough after it is decocted, the waight of a groat being put into three cuppes of Wine with some Hony. It is giuen also to them that haue the flixe, especially olde Lard, Honny, & Wine, being beaten together till they bee all as thicke as Hony, whereof the quantity of a Hasell-Nut, is to be drunke out of Water. Al∣so morsels of Swynes-Grease, Butter, and Hony, being put downe into a Horsse throate, cureth him of an old Cough, and finally a peece of this Greace being old, moystened in olde Wine, is profitable to a Horse that hath beene ouerheated in his iourney. When Calues bee troubled with belly Wormes, take one part of Swynes-Greace, and mingle it with three partes of Isope, afterwardes thrust it downe into the throates of the Calues, and it shall expell the wormes. When the tongue and Chappes waxe blacke by a peculiar sicknesse of the mouth, which the Physitians call Morbus epidemius, it is most wholesome to rub the tongue with the inner side of the rines of Bacon, and so draw out an extreame heate: and it is said if a man be deepely infected, whose tongue is thus rubbed, the said Bacon rine being eaten by any Dog, will procure his death. The fat of Wolues and the marrow of Swyne is good to anoint bleare-eyes withall. By swallowing downe the marrow of Svvine, the appetite to carnall copulation is encreased. The ashes or powder of Hogs bristles vvhich are taken out of plaisterers pensils, wher∣withall they rub Walles, and mixed with Swynes Grease, doth ease the paine of burnings, and also stayeth the bleeding of vvoundes, and the falling dovvne of the seate being first of all vvashed in Wine and dryed Pitch mingled therevvithall. The powder of the cheek∣bones of Svvyne, is a most present remedy for broken bones, and also for vlcers in the legges and shinnes. The fat of a Boare is commended against Serpentes, and so also is the liuer of a Bore pigge when the Fibres are taken from it, if the weight of two pence be drunke in wine. The braine of a Sow tosted at the fire, and laide to a Carbuncle, either disperseth or emptieth it. Likewise the blood and braines of a Bore or a sow, or Bore-pig being mixed with honey, doeth cure the Carbuncles in the yard, and the braines alone, openeth the gums of children, to let out their teeth, as Serenus writeth, Aucteneris cerebris gingivis illine porci. There are naturally in the head of a Hogge two little bones that haue holes in them, one in the right part, and another in the left. Now if it happen that a man find these bones by chaunce, either one or both of them, let him lay them vp safe, and whensoeuer he is tro∣bled with the Head-ach, let him vse them, hanging them about his necke by a silken thrid, that is to say, if his head ake on the right side, let him hange the right bone, and if on the left, the left bone: These things I report vpon the credit of Marcellus. Galen also writeth, that if the pole of the swines eare be hanged about ones necke, it will preserue him from all cough afterwards. They were wont as Dioscorides writeth, to seeth a Gudgen in a swines belly, by the ea∣ting whereof, they staied the falling downe of the seat. If a man eat the lunges of a Boare, and a sow sodden and fasting, they will preserue him from drunkennesse all that daye, and likewise the sayed lunges doth keepe the soles of the feete from inflammation which are caused by streight shooes. It also healeth the piles, clifts, and breaking of the skinne, and kibes of the feet, by laying to it a Bores gall, and a swines lungs. If a man drinke the liuer of a sow in wine, it saueth his life from the biting of venemous beastes. Also the liuer of a Bore burned with Iuniper-wood, cureth all the faults in the secrets, and drunke in Wine without salt after it is sod, stayeth the loosenesse of the belly. The gall of swine is not verye vehement, for as the whole body is waterish, so also is that, neither is there any beast heer∣in comparable vnto it, (except the wild) & that is enimy to Vlcers, ripening the sore, scat∣tering the euill humors, and resisting the bitinges of venemous Beastes. Also the gall of Bores layed to brused Articles, doth procure vnto them wonderfull ease. One shall take away an old scurffe very easily by the gall of a sow, which farrow if it be mingled with the iuyce of the hearbe Siclamine, and there withall to rub the heade wel in a Bath. To keepe haire from growing vpon the browes when it is once plucked off. Take the gall and fatte of a Bore, and put them into a smooth-thicke-earthen-pot, and of the sharpest Vineger and oyle of Almonds, foure oun es a peece, poure that into it, and then bind the mouth of the pot close with a thicke linnen cloath, so letting them stand seuen daies together, af∣terwards open them againe, and you shall finde vpon the top a certaine scum like Gold, wherewithal annoint those places, which you woulde haue remaine balde, after that you haue beaten it togither in a morter: likewise the gall of a Barrow hogge or Bore pigge, doeth scatter Apostumes and bunches in any part of the body. The gall of a Hog dryed in an Ouen, and layed vpon a Carbuncle, as much as will couer it, it cleaueth fast to the sore, and draweth out the root and core thereof. It is likewise good against the vlcers of the eares, except the Vlcer be of long continu∣ance, and then it is good to vse a sharper gall, such as is a sheepes, an Oxes, a Beares, or a Goats, they mingle herewithall sometimes oyle of roses, but for olde wounds in the ears, It is good to take one part of the best hony, and two parts of the sharpest Vineger, and so let them boile on the fire three walmes, afterwards set them farre off from the fire, vntill it leaue seething or boiling, and then put Nitre vnto it, so long til you know by the Vapor that the Niter is settled, then seeth it againe vppon a gentle fire, so as it boyleth not ouer, and lastlye put into the eares of this gal of a Bore, or of a Goate, and then seeth it the third time, taking it from the fire, when it is Luke-warme, infuse it into the eares, and this gall must not be the gall of a sow, except of such as neuer bare pig. Also this gall being dried doth cure the Haemorhods and kibes. There are also certaine slifters or clifts in the hooues of horsses, which are cured in one nights space, by applying vnto them the gal of a Barrow-hog, mingled with the yolkes of Egges. The blather of swine will prouoke vrine, and of a Boare pig sod, rosted or boyled, and so eaten and drunke, causeth a man to containe his vrine, which neuer could before. When the head of a man is exulcerated and runneth, take the bladder of a Barrow-hog, with the Vrine, and cast the same into the fat cut small, afterwards mingle it so with salt, that it may appeare all white, then binde it vp fast, and digge a hole in the Garden about a cubit deepe, wherein bury and couer the sayde gall, and so let it rest forty or fifty daies in the earth, till the matter therein contained be putrified, then take it out and melt it in a dish, and keepe the ointment that ariseth of it. Then wash the head all ouer with lye, vnto the intent that it may not be offended thorough the Acrimony thereof, mingle it with new wine or with water, and then when it is dry after such washing, annoint it with the sayde ointment, and so will the noxious and vncleane haires fall euery one off, and new pure ones arise in their place, and you must be very carefull to keepe the head from colde. They were wont to giue the stones of swine against the sauling sicknesse, but then they were first dryed, and afterwards beaten to pouder, and giuen to the sicke party in swines milke, so he was commaunded to abstaine from wine many daies before, and after he re∣ceiued it for many daies togither. In Savoye they take the stones out of a yong hog when they geld him, and scorch them at the fire so long, till they may bee crushed to peeces, and this they prescribe to be drunke in wine against the Collicke. Some giue the powder of Bores stones to men and women, to increase copulation and conception. The Magicians or wise men of the East, prescribed to be drunke for the incontinency of vrine, the pouder of a Bore pigs stones out of sweete Wine, and then to make water in a Dogs kennell, which while he is doing, to speake to himselfe these words: Ne ipse vrinam faciam vt canis in suo cubile, but I will leaue this superstition, as not worthy to be Englished. Some take the bladder of a Sovv burned to pouder, and drunke for this infirmity, and some a certaine liquerish poison, which droppeth from the Nauell of a Bore pig, immediately after it is farrowed. Bacon beaten together, and made like meale, is good against a continuall cough, or staieth bleeding at the mouth. Bacon broath is also mingled with other medicines against the gout, and they make an implaister of Bacon to scatter grauelly matter in the bladder. The bones of Bacon about the hippes, are kept to clense and rubbe teeth, and by burning of them, not onely the loose teeth in men are fastened, but also the wormes in the teeth of beasts are killed. If a horse bee troubled with the Glaunders or any such liquid matter running out at his mouth and nose, then let the broath wherein Bacon and swines feete hath bin sod, be mixed with hony, and so strained afterward, let it be beaten well togither with Egges, and so infused into the left Nosthrill of the horsse. Gagnerius prescribeth an emplaister to be made of cheese, and the feet of swine against the shrinking vp of the sin∣newes. The ancle bone of a sow being burned vntil it be white, and brused and taken in drink, doeth cure the swellings of the necke, and paines of long continuance. The Ancle bone of a Sow burned and brused, and giuen to drinke onely in Water, is a remedy against the collicke and stone. The anckle bone of a sow doth driue away those swellinges which arise in the stomacke, and doth ease the paines of the head. The ashes of the ancle bone of a sow or Bore, doeth cure Cornes, cleftse, or other rifts in the skin, and the hardnesse of the skin that is in the bottome of the feet. It is also shewed, that if the bone shall be hung about the necke of those that are trobled with quar∣terne agues, that then they shall be farre better, but of what bone he speaketh, it is vncer∣taine, but as he remembreth it is the next bone before the fat of the anckle bone. The bones that are taken from the hoofes of sowes, burned and beaten to pouder are very good to rub and clense the teeth: Also the bones next to the ribbes of Bacon, being burned, are very good to fasten the teeth. The bones that are taken from the hooues of hogs, and burned to pouder, are vsed to clense the teeth, and it is very good also to fasten the teeth. The ashes which are made of a Harts horne, or of the hoofe of a hog, are verie good to clense or rub the teeth. The bones which are taken from the hoof of a hog burnd and beaten to pouder and sifted, and a little spicknard added thereto, doth make the teeth very white, by often rubbing them therewith. The ashes of the hoofs of a Bore or sow, put in drinke, doth stay the incontinency of vrine, and also the bloody flixe. Take as much Mercurial sodden, as ones hand can hold, sod in two pintes of water vnto one pinte, and drinke the same with hony and salt, and the pouder of a Hogges hoofe, and it shall l ose the belly. The milke of a Sow drunke with sweet wine, helpeth women in trauell, and the same being drunke alone, restoreth milke in Womens breasts, It is also good against the blody flix and Tissick. The stones of swine beaten to powder, and drunke in swines milke, are good against the fauling sicknesse. The wise men were wont to prescribe the left foote or legge of a Camaelion to be bound vnto the feet against the gowt. There are also many vses of the dung of swine, and first of al it being mixed with Vine∣ger, is good against the bittinges of venemous beastes, and Aetius maketh an emplaister thereof, against the biting of a Crocodile. It is to be applyed single against the stinging of Scorpions and also the biting of any other reptile creature If a Serpent bite an Oxe or a Horse, or any other Foure-footed-Beast, take the stalke of Nigella, and beat into a pinte of olde wine, so as all the iuice may goe out thereof, then infuse it into the Nostril of the beast, and lay swines dunge to the sore, so also it may bee applied vnto men, whereunto some do ad Hony Atticke, and the vrine of a man, and so it is to be applyed warme, it be∣ing also warmed in a shell, and dried to pouder, mixed with oyle, and layed to the bodie, easeth outward paines. It is likewise profitable against burnings, itch, scabs, and blisters, and trembling of the body, according to these verses of Serenus: Stercoris ex porco cinerem confundit olimphis Sic pauidum corpus, dextra pascente foueto. This is also commended against hard bunches in the body, hardnes of the skinne, cliftes and chinkes in the flesh, freckles, lice, and nits, and also the breaking of the sinnewes: Si cui forti lapis teneros violanerit artus Non pudeat luteae, stercus perducere possae. It is also good to stay bleedinges at the nose, if it be layed to the Nosthrils warme, and to staie the bleedings of beasts, if it be giuen them in wine, the same being mixed and coue∣red with hony, is annointed vpon horses for the Quinsey or swellings of the throat. If the breastes of a woman do swel after her deliuery of childe, it is good to annoint them with water, and the dung of Hogges, also the powder thereof mixed with oile, is profitable for the secrets of men and women. If a man haue receiued any hurt by bruses, so as his blood staieth in his body, or suffer convulsion of the Nerues through Crampes, those euils are cured by the dung of a Bore gathered in the spring time, dried and sod in Viniger, and some of the later Physitians prescribe it to de drunke in water, and they say that Nero the Emperor was woont to vse that medicine, when he would try the strength of his body, in a running Chariot: also the powder of the same being drunk in Vineger, is profitable for the rupture and inwarde bruses, and warmed in Wine against al manner of flixes and Ti∣zickes For the paines of the loines and al other thinges which need mollyfieng rub them first of all with Deeres greace, and then sprinkle them with old Wine mixed with the pou¦der of Swines dung. The vrine of a Swine is also good against al bunches and apostemation being layed to in wool. The vrine of a Bore pig dryed in the smoke, and drunke with sweet Wine, the quantity of a beane, is profitable against the fauling euil. Against the white∣nes of the eyes, and the stone in the reynes and bladder. And thus much for the story of swine in generall. OF THE WILDE BORE. T His beast is tearmed by no other name then the common swine among the Haebrewes, namely, Chasir, as you may see in Psal. 80. wher the prophet speaketh of Chasir de sylva, That is; the Bore out of the wood. The Graecians call him Capros and Syagros, and Clunis, although some take Clunis for a Bore of an exceeding great stature. Aristophone saith, that there are some of this kind which are cald Monij, which worde by S. Cyril vppon the prophet Osey is interpreted a wilde Asse, but I rather incline to their opinion which saie, that Chlunis Monyos, and Chauliodon are poeticall words for cruell Bores. Aristotle is of opinion, these bores being gelt when they are young, growe greater and more fierce, whereunto Homer also yeeldeth as he is thus translated: Nutrijt exetum, sylvis horrentibus aprum Instar non bruti sed dorsi montis opaci. But this is to be vnderstoode of such Bores, as by accident geld themselues by rubbing vpon any tree. The French call this Beast, Sanglier and Porc Sanglier ; the Italians Cinghi∣ale and Cinghiare, and Porco. The Spaniards Puerco Syluestre, and Puerco montes, and I'auali, the Germans Wild Schuuein. The Illyrians Worpes, and the Latines Aper, for Porcus signi∣fieth the tame swine, and Aper the wilde. The reason of this Latine name Aper, is deriued from Asper, because he liueth among the sharp thorns and woods, but I rather think that Aper is deriued from Capros the Greeke word, or else Aper à feritate, from his fiercenesse and wildenes, by chaunging one letter into another. The epithets The Epithites of this beast are many, both in Greeke and Latine, such as these are; sharpe, wilde, Arcadian, Attalantean, troubler, bloody, toothed, hard, Erymanthean, cru∣ell, outragious, fierce, strong gnashing, lightning, yellowe, raging, Acorne-gatherer, quicke, rough, rough-haired, horrible, Maenalian, Mercean, Meleagron, threatning, wood-wanderer, cruell, Sabelican, bristle-bearer, foaming, strict, filthy, Tegean, Thuscan, fear∣full, wry-faced, truculent, deuourer, violent, Vmbrian, wound-maker, impetuous, moun∣taine-liuer, armed on both sides, and such like. But of all these Epithites there are onely three, Erimanthean, Calidonean, and Myssean, which do offer vnto vs peculiar stories, according as we find them in the poets, which wee will prefix by way of morral discourse before we enter into the natural story of this beast. First of all, Erymanthus was a hill of Arcadia, wherein was a wilde bore, that continually did descend down & depopulate their Corn-fields, Hercules comming that way, and hea∣ring of that mischiefe did kill the said Bore, and carryed him vpon his backe to Eurystheus, whereat Eurystheus was so much affraid, that he went and hid himselfe in a brazen vessell, whereof Virgill speaketh thus: Erymanthi placaret syluam, & lernam tremefecerit arcu And of this Erymanthean bore Martiall speaketh: Quantus erat calidon, & Erymanthe tuus. Of the Calidonian Bore there is this story in Homer. When Oeneus the Prince of Aetolia sacrificed the first fruits of his country to the Goddes, he forgot Diana, wherewithall she was very angry, and so sent among the people a sauage Boare, which destroyed both the Countrey and Inhabitants: against whom the Calidonians and Pleuronians went foorth in hunting, and the first of al that wounded the wilde Beast was Meleager the sonne of Oeneus, for reward wherof, he receiued his head and his skin, which he bestowd on Atalanta a vir∣gin of Arcadia, with whome hee was in loue, and which did accompany him in hunting: where withall the sonnes of Thyestius, which were the Vncles of Meleager, were greatly of∣fended▪ (for they were the brothers to his mother Althea, ) those men lay in waite to destroy him, whereof when hee was aduertised, he killed some of them, and putte the residue to flight; For which cause the Pleuronians made warre against the Calidonians : in the begin∣ning of which warre Meleager fell out with his mother, because she did not help hir coun∣try: At last when the Citty was almost taken, by the perswasion of his wife Cleopatra, hee went out to fight with his enemies, where, in valiant maner he flew many of them, others he put to flight, who in their chase running away, fell downe vpon steepe rockes and peri∣shed. Then Althea the mother of Meleager, began to rage against her sonne, and flunge in∣to the fire the torch which the fates had giuen vnto her to lengthen his daies, so when she saw her sonne was dead, she repented and flue herselfe, and afterwardes was cast into the very selfe-same burning fire with him. In the hunting of this Bore Ancaeus the companion of Iason to Colchis was slaine. This Bore is also called a Meliagran and Attalantean Bore, of whom Martiall writeth thus: Qui diomideis metuendus Setiger agris Aetola cecidit cuspide talis erat. And againe in another place: Lacte mero pastum pigre mihi mortis alumnum Ponat & Aetolo de sue diues edat. It is said that this Bore had teeth of a cubit long, & the maner of his hūting was expressed in the pinnicle of the Temple of Tegea, for which cause he is called the Tegean Bore. Vpon the one side of the Bore against his middle, were painted Atalanta, Meleager, Theseus, Te∣lamon, Peleus, Pollux, and Iolaus the companion of al Hercules trauels. Prothus and Come∣tes, the sonnes of Thiestius and brethren of Althea, on the other side of the Bore stood An∣caus wounded, and Epecus sustaining his hunting speare; next vnto him stood Castor and Amphiaraus, the sonne of Oicleus. After them Hippothus, the sonne of Cercion, Agamedes, the sonne of Stymphelus, and lastly Pirithous. The teeth of this Bore were taken away by Augustus after the time that he had ouercome Anthoney, which he hung vp in the Tem∣ple of Bacchus, standing in the Gardens of the Emperour. And thus much for the Calido∣nian Bore. Now concerning the Myssean bore, I find this story recorded of him. When Adrastus the Phrygian, who was of the kings blood, had vnawares killed his brother, he fled to Sar∣dis, and after his expiation dwelt with Cresus. It hapned at that time that there was a wilde Bore came out of Olimpus, and wasted a great part of the countrey of Myssea : the people oppressed with many losses, and terrifyed with the presence of such a beast, besought the king to send his owne sonne Attys with much company to hunt and kil the Bore. The king was affraide thereof, because in his dreame he saw a vision, his sonne perishing by an iron speare; yet at last he vvas perswaded, & committed the safegard of his body to Adrastus. When they came to the wilde beast, Adrastus bent his speare at the Bore, and while hee cast it to kill him, the sonne of Cresus came betwixt them, and so was slaine with the spear, according to the dreame of his Father. Adrastus seeing this misfortune, (that his handes which should haue defended the young prince, had taken away his life) fell into extreame passion and sorrow for the same, and although the king, knovving his innocency, forgaue him the fact, yet hee slue himselfe at the Funerall of Attys, and so vvas burned vvith him in the same fire. And thus much for the Myssean Bore. Now we will proceede to the particular story of the wilde Bore, and first of all of the countries breeding Bores. The Spaniards say, that in the new found world, there are wilde Bores much lesse then ours, which haue tailes so short, that one would think they had bin cut off, Of the wilde bores parts & other acci∣dents. they differ also in their feet, for their hinder feet are not clouen, but stand vppon one claw, and their forefeet are clouen like common swines. Their flesh also is more sweet and wholesome then common swines flesh, whereof Pe∣ter Martir giueth reason in his Ocean Decads, because they feed vnder palme Trees, neer the Sea-shore, and in Marshes. Olaus Magnus writeth, that in diuers places of Scandina∣via, they hunt wilde Bores which are twelue foot long. The wilde Bores of India accor∣ding to Pliny haue teeth, which in their compasse contain a cubit, and besides their teeth growing out of their chaps, they haue two hornes on their head like Calues hornes. In the Islands Medera, there are abundance of wilde Bores, likewise in Heluetia ; and especially in those parts that ioyne vppon the Alpes, where they would much more abound, but that the Magistrates giue liberty to euery man to kill and destroy them. There are no Bores in Affricke, except in Aethiopia, where their Bores haue all hornes, and of those it was that Lycotas the Countriman saw in a publicke spectacle at Rome : Niueos lepores & non sue cornibus apros. That is, Hares whire like swine, and Bores that haue hornes. It is a wonderfull thinge that there are no Boares in Creet, and no lesse admirable that the Bores of Macidonia are dum and haue no voice: And thus much concerning the Countries of Bores. Now concerning their colour, it is obserued, that wilde Bores for the most part are of a blacke and browne colour, especially at the top of their haire, and somewhat yellow vn∣derneath, and yet Pausanias writeth, that he hath seene Boares all white; howbeit that is not ordinary. Their blood is sharpe and blacke like blacke wine, and such as wil neuer bee thicke, their eies like to the eies of wrathfull beasts, as Wolues, and Lyons. Their tuskes are most admirable, for with them while they are aliue, they cut like sharpe kniues, but when they are dead, they haue lost that cutting property, the reason of it is in the heat of the tooth, for it is certainely affirmed by hunters of wilde Bores, that when the Beast fal∣leth first on the earth downe before the Dogges and hunters, if one pull off a bristle from his backe, Oppianus nus and lay it vpon the tuske, the heat thereof wil make it shrinke vp and turne togi∣ther like a hot yron, and if Dogges doe chaunce to touch them, they burne their haires from their backe, whereby the ardent and fiery nature of this beast is manifest, as an euer∣lasting monument of the work of God, and yet notwithstanding all their wrath they haue no gall, (as Pliny writeth) their head and face are their strongest parts, and therefore vpon them they receiue the hunters blowes as vpon a bucket. Their teares which they send forth of their eies are verie sweet, and of all other thinges they cannot abide their owne vrine, for it is thought to be so hotte, that it burneth them, and they can neuer runne away in flight, of de. till they haue emptied their bellies thereof. The place of their abode is for the most part in the marshes and woods, for the Scythians did hunt Harts and wilde Bores in the Marshes, but Roes and wilde Asses in the plaine fields. Sometimes they hide themselues among Fern, which they haue gathered together in the fields, and they dig holes and ditches for themselues, wherein they rest, and this is obser∣ued, that they loue not so much to wallow in the mite, as the tame and Domestical swine, although they be of a hotte and fiery nature. Their voice is like to the voice of common swine, but the females is somewhat more shril. They liue for the most part solitary and a∣lone, and not in heards as the other do, and feede vppon such meates as the vulgar swine. Tragus saieth, that there is a kind of greene corne in Germany, which is armed with verye sharpe stalkes and pointes at both ends like Barley, this the people do seeth and eate like pease. Now forasmuch as wilde Bores are destroyers of their Corne, they sowe that graine neer the woods sides where the Bores abide, whereby they defend and safegard their bet∣ter corne. Bores do also eat the wormes of the earth, which they dig out with their noses, and in Pamphilia and the mountaines of Cylicia, they do eat Salamanders without hurte or danger to themselues, and yet if men chance to eat of their flesh which haue so deuoured them, they die afterwards through the poison: wherby it manifestly appeareth, that there is danger in eating wilde hogs flesh. Hemlock and Henbane is also poison to swine, which they neuer eat but vnawars, and hauing eaten it presently they loose their strength in their hinder parts, whereby they are faine to draw them after them, and in that maner they craul to the water sides, where they gather together Snailes & sea-crabs, by eating wherof they are restored to their former health. Iuy is also a medicine for the diseases of Boares, and old age maketh them altogether vnfit to be preserued. Therefore in auncient time when they kept Bores in parks, whereof Fuluius Hirpinus was the first beginner, Lucius Lucullus, and Quintus Hortentius, the immediate followers, I say they neuer kept bores past 4. year old, because after that time they waxed leane and pined away. Now concerning their ge∣neration or copulation to engender, it is certaine that they do not couple often in the year as the tame swine, but only once, and that in the beginning of Winter, or the middle, The genera∣tion of wilde Swine. so that they may bring forth in the spring time of the yeare, and they chuse the most vnused, narrowe, hollowe, and steepe places to couple in. The male abideth with the female thir∣ty daies together, and the female beareth her young ones, both for the number and the time answerable to the vulger swine. When the Boare is in copulation before hand, while he worketh the sow, he carrieth a mouth as white as any horse, which as in the horse it ri∣seth through vehement stirring, so in the bore it riseth through vehement heate and fear∣uer In the time of their lust they are very sharpe, eager, and cruell, fighting withall males that come in their presence, and therefore they arme their bodies by rowling in the durt, and also by rubbing them against trees, that so they may be hard to withstand one another. This fight of bores is thus described of Virgill: Per syluas tum saeuus aper, tumpessima Tigris, Ipseruit dentes{que} sabelicus exacuit sus, Et pedibus subegit terram, fricat arbore costas, At{que} hinc at{que} illinc humeros ad vulnera durat. Being inflamed with venerial rage, he so setteth vpright the bristles of his neck, that you would take them to be the sharp fins of Dolphins; then champeth he with his mouth, The fight of Boares. gra∣teth and gnasheth his teeth one against another, and breathing forth his boyling spirit, not only at his eies, but at his foaming white mouth, he desireth nothing but copulation, and if his female endure him quietly, then doth shee satisfie his lust, and kill all his anger; but if she refuse, then doth he either constraine her against her will, or else layeth hir dead vpon the earth. Somtime they force a tame Sow, and then the pigs so begotten, are cald Hybridae, that is, by way of contumely, bastards: And it is to bee obserued, that neuer any wilde beast being tamed doth engender copulation, except they bee tamed very young, onely wilde Bores do quickly mingle with vulgar swine. The female of this kinde hath no teeth standing out of her mouth like the male, except very short ones, and therefore the residue are more like a saw then the teeth of a Boare, for it is a generall rule; Nulli dentes exerti quibus serrati. Concerning the disposition of Bores in generall, it is brutish, stubborne, and yet coura∣gious; wrathfull, and furious, because their bloud is full of fibres, and ministreth vnto them sudden matter of anger, neither are ther any beasts so clothed with haire, as Lyons and Bores; wherefore both of them are of like fierce and angry nature, yet we haue shew∣ed in the story of the Hart, how they were drawne from their meat and dens by the voice of musick. It is said that they are not capable of any discipline or instruction, and yet Sca∣liger affirmeth, that he saw a Bore that belonged to the Lord of Saluimont, of an exceeding great stature, tamed by his maister, who at the sounding of the hornes, would come run∣ning like a dog to hunting, and go abroad with his maister among the Dogs, contending with the most swift in race to attaine the prey. They naturally desire to bury their owne footsteps in wet miry places, that they may not bee found out by the hunters; and as the rage of the Boares is greatest in the time of their lust, so is it in the Sowes after their farrowing and therfore it was an excellent speech of Cyaxares vnto Syrus, that Swyne when they see the Hunter, although they be many, yet run away with their pigs; but if the Hunter follow one of the young ones, then doth the dam turne againe, and withall her force endeuoure to destroy him that would depriue hir of her yong ones. Before the Bores do fight they go and whet their teeth, but while they are in contention, if it happen that a Wolfe commeth in sight, then they forsake their mu∣tuall combats, and all of them ioyne together to driue away the Wolfe. The Beare dareth not to enter vpon the wilde Bore, except behind him and vnawares. Hesiod saith, that Vul∣can pictured vppon the shield of Hercules, the images and shapes of many wilde beastes fighting one with another, neither of both yealding to other, till both of them fell downe dead, which caused Alciatus to make this Emblem of a vulture stāding by to see their con∣tention, and suffered them to kill one another without parting, whereby afterwardes she enioyed their dead carkases, Dum saeuis ruerent in mutua vulnera telis, Vngue leaena serox dente timendus aper, Accurrit vulter spectatum, & prandia captat, Gloria victoris praeda futura sua est. It is reported that Bores will swim single and alone like fishes, and some of them two togi∣ther like Wolues, Swimming of Boares. and many times in flocks and heards like Roes, for such is their ardent nature and desire of meat, that they feare not the highest Mountains, nor the deepest wa∣ters. Now concerning the flesh of wilde Bores, although we haue spoken aboundantly in the former discourse of Swyne, yet must we adde something in this place; for although generally the flesh of tame swine is viscous and colde, yet the flesh of the wilde is more temperate and nourishable, and therefore of lighter concoction and stronger nourish∣ment. Therefore those which had a Timpany were prescribed to eate Bores flesh and wilde Sowes, for it dryeth, strengthneth, and moueth; and men that are vexed with Saint Anthonies fire, are forbidden to eate all salt meates and leauened bread, yet permitted to eate of Bores flesh. It is reported that Publius Seruillus Rullus, was the verye first among all the Romans that did set at his table a whole Boare, most delicately dressed and stuffed with variety of diuers costly dishes, which Bore by Varro is cald Aper Millianius, that is, Milli∣librarum, of a thousand pound worth; against which intollerable gluttony and cost, Iuuenall made these verses; Quanta est gula quae sibitotos, Ponit Apros animal propter conuiuia natum. Apitius in the beginning of his eight booke, prescribeth the maner how to dresse the flesh of wilde Bores, wherewithall if any be delighted let him reade that booke, for it is not my purpose in this Treatise, to blot any paper with any long instruction for Cooks and Belli∣gods, neither were it any part of this naturall History, nor yet agreeable to my calling or enterprise, and therefore I will onely adde this obseruation of Misaldus, that Bores flesh salted in poudring tubs, doth change both colour and tast, at that time of yeare, wherin the liuing Bores do rage vpon their females: And thus much shall suffice to haue spoken of Bores flesh. Of the hun∣ting of wilde Bores. Now in the next place wee will proceede to talke, concerning the hunting of Boares which is not onely a pastime for Lords and Princes, but also a necessary labour for mea∣ner men; for as the harme that commeth by bores is exceeding great, and so much the greater by how much he is poorer that doth sustaine it, so the vtility to learne the meanes of destroying this beast is more commodious, because the common prouerb is more true in this then in the vulgar swine, that they neuer do good till they are dead. It is reported of Dioclesian when he was agent for the Romans in France, there came an olde Woman called Dryas vnto him, and reproued him for his couetousnesse, telling him that he was ouer-sparing, and persimonious; to whom he answered in iest, when I am Empe. I wil be more liberal: Dryas replyed vnto him, Noli Iocare Dioclesiane, nā imperator eris cum aprū occideris. That is, Iest not O Dioclesian, for thou shalt be Emp. when thou hast killed Aper, (that was a Bore as he thought,) and therefore he gaue himselfe to the hunting of Bores, neuer sparing any time that was offred vnto him, alwaies expecting the euent of that speech, whereof he vvas frustrated vntill he killed Arius Aper, the gouernor of the iudge∣ment hall, and then afterwards being Emperor he knew that the women did not meane a Boare, but a man. Now therefore the hunting of Boares, and the manner of their taking is many waies, either by violence in chase, or by pollicie in ditches and traps, or else by im∣poysoned baites. The best time of their hunting is in the middest of winter as some say, but I thinke the Winter is the worst time, because then they are strongest, and seeing all Swine are impacient of heate, the Summer will quickly end their life, if then they bee cha∣sed. It behooueth therefore the hunter of Boares to be very wary, and therefore the aun∣cientes ordayned that such a one should weare a rough garment of a broune colour, and likewise that his Horse should be of a yellow and firy colour, and that the Boare spear shold be strong and sharp, for this beast is armed with a very strong head and skin, and besides they couer themselues with dryed durt, as it were with a coate of male to blunt the Wea∣pon, and therefore he runneth willingly either without dread or feare vpon the hunters. In which encounter if he receiueth not a deadly wound, hee ouerthrovveth his aduersary, except he fall flat on the ground, for the Boares teeth cannot cut vpward, but downevvard; therefore if the Hunter be a foote-man, he must seate himselfe neere some tree, and then also prouide that if he misse the Boare, he may easily climbe into the boughes, and so saue himselfe; but if the Swyne that is raised be a female, she will all to teare and bite the Hun∣ter with her teeth if she get him within hir clutches: wherfore for the more speedy ending of the hunting, it is good to raise the beast earely in the morning before he hath made wa∣ter, for the burning of his bladder doth quickly make him weary. But if the boare haue either made water before, or got liberty and rest in the chase to ease himselfe, then will his taking be very difficulte and tedious, such is the nature of this couragious beast, that he neuer ceaseth running till he bee weary, and being wearied de∣sembleth the same by sitting vpon his buttocks, and offereth combat to his Hunter, and yet he is not wont to strike a man vntill he be wounded first by him. When the Boare is first raised out of the Wood, he snuffeth in the winde, lifting vp his Nose to smell what is with him, and what is against him. The hunting speare must be very sharp and broad, branching forth into certain forkes or hornes, so as by no meanes the Boare shall breake through them vppon the Hunter, and when he bendeth the same before the beast, hee must stand with one leg before ano∣ther like a wrestler, holding his left hand vpon the middle of the speare to direct the same, and the right hand behind, to thrust it forward with violence, hauing his eye intent vpon the beast, and if it be a boare to wound him in the middle of his forehead betwixt his eye∣lids, or else vppon the shoulder, for in both those places the wound is deadly; but if hee chance to hit him on the cheeke, the greatest harme that hee doth him, is that he maketh him vnfit to vse his tuskes: of this he must be very careful that if the boare leap vpon him, he likewise must giue backe and draw out his sword; and if he chaunce to bee ouerturned, then to lye downe in some hollow place where the boare cannot come at him vvith his teeth. Now concerning the instruction of dogs, and the choyce of such hounds as are appoin∣ted for the hunting of boares, you must note, that euery Dog is not fit for the same, but great mastiues, such as are vsed for the baiting of beares. For the boare first of all terrify∣eth the Dog with his voice, and if he bee not ready to fight but to run away, then are the Hunters in worse case then at the beginning. Therefore they must be sure to haue them well instructed before they giue the onset, and bee likewise at hand to encourage them. When they come fyrst of all to the place wherin they coniecture the boare is lodged, if there be no appearance either by his footsteps, or by the woundes of his teeth vpon the trees and boughes, then let them let loose one of the best houndes, and casting about the wood follow with the residue weather the cry goeth. The Dogge presseth into the thickest bushes where commonly the boare lodgeth, and when he hath found the beast he standeth still and bayeth, then must the Hunter come and take vp that Dogge, for the Boare will not stir very easie out of his lodging, and goe and set vp his nets and toyles in all the by places, whereby it is likely the beast will passe, and these must he hang to some trees, for postes in the earth will not suffice, alwaies make king the inside of them very light, that the beast may suspect no harme. The nets being thus set vp, let him returne againe to his dogs, loosing them all; and euery hunter arming himselfe with dartes and a boares speare, so let the most skilfull followe the dogs close to exhort them & set them on, the residew followe one after another a good distance, scat∣tering themselues into sundry angles, for their better safegard and end of their sport: for if they should come all together, the Boare might light vppon them and wound some of them, for vppon whosoeuer he falleth in his rage hee hurteth them: furthermore when the dogs beginne to come neere to his lodging, then must they bee set on more eagerly, and so hartened that they be no waies appalled at the rasing of the Boare, for his manner is to make force at the formost dogge that is nearest to him, so must hee bee followed in chase euen vnto the nets, but if the nets stand vppon a side hill, or a steepe Rocke, then when he is insnared he will get out with no difficulty; but if it stand vppon plaine ground, the toiles will hold him till the hunters come, who must presently take care, to wound him with darts and speares before they meddle with him, compassing him round about very warily, so that he nor they hurt any of the dogges, and especially they must wound him in the face or shoulders, where the wounds are mortall as I haue sayd before: but if it hap∣pen that the beast getteth loose when hee feeleth the blowes, the hunters must not start a∣vvay, but the strongest of them to meete him vvith his speare, setting his body as vve haue formerly expressed, hauing an especiall eye to the beasts head, which way soeuer he wind∣eth and turneth the same, for such is the nature of the Bore, sometimes he snatcheth the speare out of the Hunters hands, or else recoyleth the force backe againe vpon the smi∣ter, for by both these meanes the hunter is ouercome and ouerthrowne: whensoeuer this happneth, then is there but one meanes to saue the hunters life, which is this, another of his companions must come and charge the Boare, making as though hee would wound him with his dart, but not casting it for feare of hurting the hunter vnder his feete. When the Boare seeth this, he forsaketh the first man and rusheth vpon the second, who must looke to defend himselfe with all dexterity, composing his body, and ordering his weapons according to artificiall Bore-hunting, & in the meane season the vanquished hunter must arise againe, taking fresh hold on his speare, and with all courage setting vp∣pon the aduersarie beast, to wound him either in the shoulders or in the head, for it is no credit to escape with life, except he kill and ouercome the Boare. When hee feeleth himselfe thus wounded that hee cannot liue, if it vvere not for the crosses and forkes vppon the Boare-speare, hee vvould presse in vppon the vanquisher to take reuenge for his death; For so great is the feruent wrath of this beast, that he spareth not to kill and wound, although he feel vpon him the pangs of death: and what place soe∣uer he biteth either vpon dog or man, the heate of his teeth inflicteth a dangerous infla∣ming wound: and for this cause if he doth but touch the haire of dogs, he burneth it off, but if it be a female that is raised, (for there is as great a rage in females as in males though not so great power) then must the hunter take heede he neuer fall to the ground, for as the male hurteth not but when a man standeth or lyeth high, so the female hurteth not but when a man falleth or lyeth low: therefore if the hunter chance to fall, he must rayse himselfe withall speede, vsing no lesse dexterity and courage against the female, then hee doth against the male. There is also another manner of hunting wilde Swyne, which is this: first of all they set vp their nets in all passages, through which it is likely the beast will goe, then do the men and dogs with a gallant cry, filling the woods and fieldes, raise them out of their lodgings. In the meane season, setting some valiant hunters to keepe the nets. When the beast per∣ceiueth that he is sought after, vp he starteth, looking about him like an euill spirit where he may deuoure, but being terrified with the cry of men, and pursued by a multitude of greedy Dogs, forth he runneth in some of his vsuall waies, carefully looking behind him to auoide the traine that followeth, vntill he fall fast enclosed into the Hunters nets, then commeth the keeper of the nets, and woundeth him with his Boare-Speare, as I sayde be∣fore: but if it fortune that hee fall out of the Nettes, or neuer commeth to them, then must they prosecute him, both Men and Dogges, vntill they haue wearied him, for such is the heate of his body, that he cannot long stand, and although he shall lodge him∣selfe in some marish or woodes where the hunters can haue no vse of their nets, yet must they not be afraid to approch vnto him, and with such hunting instruments as they haue, shew the magnitude and courage of their mind, by attaining their game by the strength of hand, when they are depriued from the help of Art: And to conclude, the same deuises, diligence, labour, prosecution, and obseruations, are to bee vsed in the hunting of the Boare, which are prescribed for the hunting of the Hart. It sildome falleth out that the pigs of wilde swine are taken, for they run and hide themselues among the leaues, and in the woods, sildome parting from their parents vntill their death, and as we haue said al∣ready, the dams fight for their young ones most irefully. For it is not with these as with the vulgar Swine, that they beate away their young ones for following them, but because they conceiue but sildome, they suffer their pigges to accompany them a whole yeare: And thus much for the violent and forceable hunting of Boares. Now followeth the arti∣ficiall deuises and pollicyes which haue bin inuented for the same purpose, m nes to take Boares. whereby to take them without pursute of Dogs, and first of all the same engins which we haue pre∣scribed for taking of the Hart, are also in vse for taking of the Boare, and Petrus Crescenti∣cusis sheweth how a multitude of Boares may be taken together in one ditch; and first of all (he saith) neere to the place where Boares make their abode, they sow in some plain fields a kind of fatting corne which hogs loue, and about that field they make a high and strong hedg of the boughs of trees in the one part, whereof they leaue a great gap, yet not altogi∣ther down to the ground At the time of the yeare when the graine waxeth ripe, the Boars gather thereinto in great number: now right ouer against the said gap on the other side, there is another little low place of the hedge left, ouer which the swine may easily leape. When the watch-man-hunter seeth the field full, he commeth alone and vnarmed to the first gap, and therein he standeth lewring and making a terrible noise to affright the swine; now on the other side where the hedg is left low, there is also made a vast and deepe ditch, the hogs being terrified with the presence and noise of the hunter, and seeing him stand in the place of their entrance, run too and fro to seeke another escape, and finding none, but that low place of the hedge before the ditch, ouer they presse headlong as fast as they can, and so fal into the trench one vpon another. Again, neere Rome there be diuers that watch in the woods, and in the night time when the Moone shineth, set vp certaine Iron instru∣ments through which there glistereth fire, vnto which the Boares and wilde swine will ap∣proch, or at the leastwise stand still and gaze vpon them, and in the meane season the hun∣ters which stand in secret come and kil them with their darts: and to conclude, in Armenia, there are certaine black venemous fishes, which the inhabitants take and mixe with meale and cast them abroad where bores and wild Swine did hant, by eating wherof as also Hem∣lock and Henbane, they are quickly poisoned and dye: And thus much we haue shewed out of Xenophon and other Authors, the seueral waies of hunting and taking of wild Swyne. Men that haue perished by Boares in hunting. Now forasmuch as the hunting thereof hath bin often shewed to be dangerous both to men and dogs, I wil a little adde some histories concerning the death of them, which haue bin killed by Boares. For if that commeth not to passe which Martiall writeth; Thusscae glandis aper populator, & ilice multa, Impiger Aetolae fama secunda fere, Quem meus intrauit splendenti cuspide culter, Praeda iaces nostris inuidiosa focis. I say if the Boare be not killed by men, the hunter is constrained many times to say with the Lydia in the same Poet; Fulminio spumantis apri sum dente perempta. Apulaius reporteth, of one Leopolemus, that he loued the wife of Thrasillus ; now to the intent that he might possesse hir, he tooke hir husband abroad with him to the hunting of a boare, that vnder colour therof he might kil him, and say the bore slew him: Being abroad, the nets raised, & the dogs loosed▪ there appeard vnto thē a bore of a monstrous shape, wonderfull fat, with horrible haire, a skin set with standing bristles, rough vpon the back, & his mouth continually foaming out aboundance of froath, & the sound of his gnashing teeth ringing like the ratling of armot; hauing fire-burning eies, a despitefull looke, a violent force, and e∣uery way feruent: the slew the noblest Dogs which fyrst set vpon him, not staying till they came to him, but he sought out for them, breaking their cheeks & legs asunder, euen as a dog vvill do some small bones; then he trod dovvne the nets in disdaine, passing by them that offered him the first encounter, and yet remembring his owne vigor and strength, turning backe againe vpon them, first ouerthrowing them, and grinding them betwixt his teeth like Apples, at length he meetes with Thrasillus, and first teareth his cloth from his backe, and then likewise tore his body in peeces, and this man I remember in the first place to be killed by this monster-Boare, wheather he was a beast or a man. Martiall in his booke of spectacles remembreth a story of Diana, who killing of a wilde Sow with pig, the young ones leaped out of her belly, and this I thought good to remember here, although it be somewhat out of place; Inter caesariae discrimina saeua Dianae, Fixisset grauidam cum leuis hacta suem, Exiliet partus misere de vulnere matris, O lucinae ferox hoc peperisset fuit? Anseus the father of Agapener was killed by the Calidonian Boare, as we haue said already. Carmon was slain by a boare in the Mountaine Tmolus. There was one Attas a Syrian, and another an Arcadian, and both these were slaine by Boares, as Plutarch writeth in the life of Sertorius. It is reported of one Attes a Phrygian, that as he kept his Sheepe he did con∣tinually sing songes in commendation of the mother of the Gods, for which cause she lo∣ued him, honored him, and often appeared vnto him; wherein Iupiter fell to be offended, and therefore sent a Boare to kill Attes. Rea after his death lamented him, and caused him to be buried honorably. The Phrygians in his remembrance did euery yeare in the spring time lament and bewaile him. Adonis also, the Lemon of Venus is fayned of the Poets to be killed by a Boare: and yet Macrobius saith, that it is an alegory of the sunne & the Winter, for Adonis signifieth the Sunne, and the Boare, the Winter: for as the Boare is a roughe and sharpe beaste, ly∣uing in moyst cold, & places couered with frost, & doth properly liue vpon winter fruits, as Acornes, so he is the fitter emblem for Winter, that is, a deuourer of the Sunnes heat, and warmth, both which fall away by death from all liuing creatures. When Tuthras a King of Myssia went to hunt in the Mountaine Thrasillus, he started a huge great Boare, which he and his gaurd followed and hunted vnto the Temple of Diana Orthosia, wherin∣to the Boare entered for sanctuary. The poore Beast seeing the Hunters at hand, cryed out with the voyce of a man: Par∣ce ô rex pecudi deae. O King spare Dianayes Boare: but the King being nothing at all mo∣ued therewith, slew him in the Temple; which wickednesse the Gods could not endure, and therefore first of all she restored the Boare to life, and afterwardes afflicted the King with madnesse, who was therefore driuen into the Mountaines, and there liued like a beast. When Lysippe his mother knew heereof, she went to him into the Woodes, and carri∣ed Cyranius the prophet, who instructed him to pacifie the Gods by a sacrifice of Oxen, which when it was performed the King recouered againe his right minde; and so his mo∣ther in remembrance thereof, built there a Chappell to Diana, and set thereupon the picture of a Boare in Gold, with a mans mouth. There was also a custome in ancient time for champions and their fathers brethren and kindred, to sweare by a Boare cut in peeces. And thus much for the naturall and morrall story of the Boare, which I will conclude with those verses of Horace, describing the prodigious habitation of Boares in the waters, and Dolphins in the woods, as if one had changed with another; Delphinum syluis appingit, fluctibus aprum, Qui variare cupit rem prodigialiter vnam. The medicines of the wilde swine. There are declared a M things concerning the remedies of Goats, but a larger and more ample power shalbe shewn of a wild beast of the same kind. Also the same regard shalbe had concerning the remedies of a tame Sow and a wild Boare, yea of all other tame and wilde beasts, that is, that the same or things like to either of them may be ended, differing onely according to more or lesse, because the same parts of wilde beasts liuing, are lesse moist & colde then those that are tame. That which we repeat heere concerning the common re∣medies of a bore and sow tamed, in some of the parts of them, to wit the blood, the braine, the cheeke bone, the lungs or lights, the liuer, the gall, the anckle bone, the hoofe, the dung and vrine, is not in the sow repeated before. The braines of a bore taken with blood, is very much commended against the bitings of serpents. Againe, the braines and blood of a boare, doeth helpe those that feare the comming of carbuncles. The lard and fat of a bore being sodden and bound fast toge∣ther, doth with a wonderfull celerity make firme those bones that are broken. The fat of abore mingled with hony and Rozin, is very much commended against the bitinges of Serpents. The fat of a wild Bore mingled with the fat of the lungs or lights, doth very much pro∣fit those which haue their feet broken or brused by any mischance. The fat of a Bore be∣ing mixed with oile of Roses, is very good for those that are troubled with blisters or pu∣shes, it being annointed thereupon. The braines of a Bore is very profitable for carbun∣cles, and the paines of a mans yard. The braines of a Boare being brused very small in hony, and put thereto, doth wonderfully make it sound. The braines of a Bore sodden & drunke in Wine, doth ease all the paines and greefes. There are more thinges spoken concerning the remedies of the braine in the medicines of the sowe. The ashes of the cheeke-bone of a Boare, doeth cure those vlcers which doe encrease bigger by little and little. Also the same thing doth make firme those bones that are broken. The lungs or lights of a Bore mixed with hony, and put vpon the feet after the manner of a mollyfieng em∣plaister, they shall bee freed from all exulcerations. Dioscorides also doth commend the lungs or lightes of Sowes, lambes, and Beares. The liuer of a Bore being new killed and scorched by a fire, and beaten to powder, and so being taken in wine, is an especiall reme∣die against the bitings of Serpents and Dogges. The liuer of a Bore being olde and drun∣ken in wine with rue, it is very much commended against the bitings of serpents. The Fi∣bres of the liuer of a bore, and those especially which are nearest to the enteraunce of the gall and liuer, being taken in Vineger or rather wine, is much profitable against the bitings of Serpents. The liuer of a bore is good to reuiue those whose spirits are drousie. The liuer of a bore doth much profit, being stopped in the eares, for those that are trobled with Apostumes or any running sores therein. The liuer of a bore being new killed and drunken in wine, is very effectual against the loosenesse of the belly. There are certaine little stones in the li∣uer of a bore, as there is in a common or vulgar sow, or at leastwise like vnto little stones, and they are also white, which being sodden and taken in wine are very effectuall against the disease of the stone. Thou shalt read many more thinges concerning the remedies of the liuer of a bore in the medicines of the sow. The gall of a bore is very much commen∣ded for Wennes or swellings in the necke. The gall of a bore being mingled with Rosin and Waxe, doth cure those vlcers which do encrease bigger and bigger. The gall of a bore, and Lambes milke, being mingled to∣gether, and dropped in the eares, is very profitable for all paines therein. The body of a man being annointed with the gall of a bore, doth stirre him vp to carnal copulation. The gall of a bore being mingled with suet, and applyed vpon euery ioynt of the body, doeth immediately cure all paines of the gout. We haue declared also many things in the medi∣cines of the Sow, concerning the remedies of the gall of a bore. The stones of a boare be∣ing eaten, is very good against the fauling sicknesse, or the stones of a bore being taken in Mares milke or water, is also very effectual against the same disease. The hoofes of a bore being burned to ashes, and sprinkled vppon drinke, and so taken, doeth very much helpe those that cannot easily make water. The hooues of a bore being burned, and beaten to powder, and giuen in drinke, is very effectuall against the stopping of vrine. The hooues of a bore or sow being burned and gi∣uen to drinke in wine, is very much commended for those that cannot holde their vrine in their sleepe. The dung of a sow (which liueth in the woods) belng dryed and drunke in water and wine, doth stay the voiding of blood, and doth ease also old paines of the sides And againe being taken in Vineger, it doth stay al ruptures and convulsion, and also be∣ing mingled with the sirrup of roses, it doth remedy or helpe those places which are out of ioynt. The dung of a Bore being new made and hot, is a speciall remedy against the flux of blood which yssueth forth of the Nostrils. The dung of a Bore being mingled in Wine, and applyed after the forme of an emplaister, do presently draw away and make sound a∣ny thinge which cleaueth to the Body. It being also brused and sodden with hony, and afterwards kneaded like Dow, and so applyed to the ioynts, doth ease all paines that arise therein. An emplaister made of the dung of a Bore, is very profitable against all venemous bi∣tings, for it draweth forth the poison. All other vlcers are filled vppe and clensed with the dung of a Bore, except those which arise in the thighes. The dung of a bore dried and bea∣ten to pouder, and sprinkled vpon drinke, doth cure all paines of the sides. Againe, it bee∣ing dryed and beaten to pouder, and administered in wine, doth not onely cure the paine in the Spleene, but also the paine in the kidnies. The dung of a bore being burned to the ashes, Pliny, Marcellus. and giuen to drinke in wine, doth ease all paines in the knees and legges. The dung of a bore new made and annointed vpon those places that are out of ioynt, is verie profi∣able for them. The dung of a field-bore, mixed with brimstone, and taken in Wine, and strained Pitch, is very commendable for paines in the Hips. The dunge of a bore being mingled with wine, and afterwardes strained, and giuen to drinke, about the measure of two little cuppefuls at a time, doth speedily helpe those which are trovbled with the Scy∣atica. It also being sodden in Vineger and Honey, doeth mittigate all paines that rise in the feet or anckles. The dung of a Bore burned to ashes, and sprinckled vpon wine luke-warm, and so giuen to drinke, doth helpe all those that are troubled with the bloody flixe. The rest of the remedies which concerne the dung of a Bore, thou shalt finde in the medicines of the sow. The vrine of a Bore mingled with hony and Water, and so taken, in a speciall remedy for those that are troubled with the fauling sicknesse. Againe, the vrine of a Bore being taken in sweet Vineger, doth driue out those things which are dried in the bladder. The vrine of a Bore being kept in a glasse, doeth cure all diseases and paines in the eares, but it is especially profitable for those which cannot hear. The vrine of a Bore being kept in a glasse, Sextus. and made luke-warme, and dropped into the eares is a speciall remedy for all Apostumes that are therein. The vrine of a Bore which is kept long, is farre more profitable, if so be, that it bee kept in a vessell of glasse. Againe the vrine of a Bore being dryed in smoake, and moistened with hony, and so poured into the eares, doth cure the deafenesse of the eares. The vrine of a Bore and oile of Cypresse, each of them being equally mingled and made Luke warme, is also good for the same di∣sease. The vrine of a wilde Bore also is of the same force and vertue. The bladder of a wilde Bore doth stay the incontinency of the vrine, if it be eaten, rosted, or boiled. The blather of a Goate being burned to powder, and giuen to drinke in water and wine, is very good and profitable for those which cannot make water easily. The vrine of a Bore being drun∣ken, doth helpe those that are troubled with the stone in the bladder, but it is more effe∣ctual if it be first of all mingled with the dung. The bladder of a Bore, moistned with the vrine, Sextus. and hung vp vntill the waterish humor commeth foorth, and then boiled and gi∣uen to those which are Truculent with the Stranguri, is verie profitable and good for them. Marcellus. The bladder of a boare being dried and giuen in drinke, is very profitable for those which are troubled with paines in the bladder and wringinges of the guts. The vrine of a tame Bore hung vp in the smoke in the bladder of a sow, and mixed with drinke, is verye profitable for those that are troubled with the Strangury. The vrine of a Bore or at least wise the bladder being giuen in drinke, hath cured those which haue bin troubled with the Hidropsey as some do say. The vrine of a Bore being taken in drinke, is very good for those that are troubled with he stone. Now forasmuch also as hunters are hurt by some, I thought it good to set down what remedies is fit for them. Therefore the woundes made of them are daungerous, because they are not onely deepe, but also large and great, and it is also impossible to bring them to agluttination with medicines, for the lips of the wounds which is made by contusion, are cut off, and burned. They vse a mutuall gnashing and striking of their teeth together, as it were against a whetstone, to take reueng vpon those which pursue and followe them. Therefore they cause a certaine scab to grow vpon the lips of the wound, wherefore it is meet to vse a suppuratiue and not a gluttinatiue maner of cure in them. It is meet to vse in running and moist vlcers, not hot things but cold, both in Winter and Summer. For it is an easie matter for a Boare to hurt a Horsse in the inside of his knee in the time of his hunting, which doth breed to a waterish vlcer, and there doth also follow a swelling. To this cold things is to be applyed, and it is to be cured by anointing it with a medicin which is called Diachalcanthes, or the head of a Dog, being burned without the tongue, and bea∣ten into powder, and so to be applyed after the manner of a Cataplasme. And thus much concerning the medicines of the Bore. OF THE TATVS, OR GVINEAN BEAST. T His is a foure-footed strange Beast, which Bellonius saith, he found in Turchia, among the mounte-bankes and Apothi∣caries. It is brought for the most part out of the new-found world, and out of Guinia, and may therefore be safely con∣ueyed into these parts, because it is naturally couered with a harde shell, deuided and interlined like the fins of fishes, outwardly seeming buckled to the backe like coat-armor, within which, the beast draweth vp his body, as a Hedghog doth within his prickled skin; and therefore I take it to be a Brasilian Hedghog. It is not much greater then a little pig, and by the snout, ears, legs, and feet thereof, it seemeth to be of that kind, sauing that the snout is a litle broader, & shorter then a pigs, and the tail very long like a Lizards or rats, and the same couered al ouer with a crust or shel. The gaping of the mouth is wider then a swines; and one of these being brought into France, did liue vpon the eating of seeds, and frutes of the Gardens, but it appeareth by that picture, or rather the skinne stuffed, which Adrianus Marcillius the Apothecary of Vlmes, sent vnto Gesner, from whence this pict∣ture heere expressed was taken, that the feete thereof are not clouen into two partes like swine, but rather into many like Dogges, for vpon the hinder feete there are fiue toes, and vpon the forefeete fowre, whereof two are so smal that they are scarse visible. The bredth of that same skin was about seuen fingers, and the length of it two spans, the shell or crust vpon the backe of it did not reach downe vnto the rumpe or taile, but broke off as it were vpon the hips, some foure fingers from the taile. The Merchants as I haue herd and Cittizens of London keepe of these with their Garden wormes. Of the Aiochtochth. T Here is another beast that may bee compared to this, (whereof Cardanus writeth,) and hee calleth the name of it Aiotochth. It is a strange creature, found in Hispania noua, neare the riuer Aluaradus, being not greater then a Cat, hauing the bil or snowt of a Mallard, the feet of a Hedge-hog, and a very long necke. It is couered al ouer with a shell like the trappinges of a horsse, diuided as in a Lobster and not continued as in an Oyster; and so couered heere with, that neither the necke nor head appeare plainely, but onely the eares; and the Spa∣niards for this cause call it Armato and Contaexto : There be some doe affirme that it hath a voice like swine, but the feet thereof are not indeed so clouen, that they remaine vnequal, but are like to a horses, I meane the seueral cloues. There are of these as I haue hearde to be seene in Gardens in London, which are kept to destroy the Garden wormes. OF THE TIGER. The names of Tigers. T He worde Tigris is an Armenian worde, which signifieth both a swift Arrow, and a great riuer, and it should seeme that the name of the riuer Tigris was therefore so called, because of the swiftnes thereof, and it seemeth to be deri∣ued from the Haebrew word Gir and Griera, which signifie a dart. Munster also in his Dictionary of three languages doth interpret Tigros for a Tiger, and Alai. In the 4. of Iob, the word Laisk by the Septuagints is translated Murmele∣on, and by S. Ierom Tigris. The Iewes call the same beast Phoradei, which the Graecians call Tigris ; and al the people of Europe to whom this beast is a stranger, call it after the Greeke name, as the Italians Tigre and Tigra, the French Vn Tigre, and the Germaines Tigerthier. Of the riuer Tigrys. Now, concerning the name of the riuer Tigris, which because it ioyneth in affinity with this beast, it is necessary that I should say something in this place, because that wee finde in holy scripture that it is one of the foure riuers which runneth through Paradice, which according to Iosephus, maketh many compasses and windings in the world, and at last fauleth into the redde sea, and they further say that there is no riuer of the world that runneth so swiftly as this: And therefore Tigris vocatur, id est Sagitta, quod iaculum vel Sa∣gittam velocitate aequet: That is, It is called a Tiger, a Dart, or Arrow, because it runneth as fast as an Arrow flyeth: and for this cause wee finde in Theocritus, that a riuer in Sicilia was called Asis, thrt is: Spiculum, a dart. Some of the poets doe deriue the name of the riuer Tigris from this Tiger the wilde beast, whereupon these Histories are told. They say, that when Bacchus was distracted & put out of his wits by Iuno, as he wandered too and fro in the world, he came to the riuer ylax (which was the first name of this water) and being there desirous to passe ouer, but founde no means to accomplish it, Iupiter in commisseration of his estate did send vnto him a Tiger, who did willingly take him vpon his backe, and carry him ouer; Afterwarde Bacchus called that swift riuer by the name of that swift beast, Tiger. Others do report the tale thus. When Dionisius fell in loue with the Nymph Alphesiboea whom by no means either by promises, intreaties, or rewards he could allure vnto him, at last he turned him∣selfe into a Tiger, and so oppressing the Nimph through feare, did carry her ouer that ri∣uer, and there begot vpon her his sonne Medus, who when he came to age, remembring the fact of his father and mother, called the name of the riuer Tigris, because of his Fa∣thers transformation. But to leaue this matter as not woorth the standing vpon, whether the riuer was called after the name of the beast, or the beast after the name of the riuer, or rather both of them after the name of the dart or swift Arrow, we wil proceed to the na∣turall story of the Tiger, commending that to the Readers iudgement which is essentiall to this story, contayning in it necessary learning, and garnished with all probabilitie. First of herefore Tigers like Lyons are bred in the East, South, and hot countries, Countries breeding Tigers. because their generation desireth aboundance of heate, such as are in India and neare the red Sea, and the people called Asangae or Besingi which dwell beyond the riuer Ganges, are much troubled and anoyed with Tigers. Likewise the Prasians, the Hercanians and the Armenians. Apolonius with his companions traueling betwixt Hiphasis and Ganges, saw many Tigers. In Barigaza and Dachinabades, which is beyond the Mediteranian region of the East, there are aboundance of Tigers and all other wilde beastes, as Arrianus wri∣teth. In Hispaniola, Ciamba, and Guanassa, Peter Martyr saith, by the relation of a Spani∣ard inhabiting there, that there are many Lyons and Tigers. The Indians say, that a Tiger is bigger then the greatest horse, Quantitie of Tigers. and that for strength and swiftnesse they excell all other beastes. There be some which haue taken them for Ti∣gers, which are called Thoes, greater then Lions, and lesser then the Indian Tigers, as it were twice so bigge as Lyons; but I rather agree to the relation of Arrianus, Strabo, Me∣gastines, & Mearcus, for they say that a Tyger feareth not an Elephant, & that one of them hath beene seene to flye vpon the head of an Elephant and deuour it: and that among the Prasians when foure men led one of these Tigers tamed, by the way they met with a Mule, and that the Tiger tooke the Mule by the hinder legge, drawing him after him in his teeth, notwithstanding all the force of the Mule and his foure leaders; which is vnto me a sufficient argument not onely of his strength, but of his stature also: and if any haue been seen of lesser stature, they haue been mistaken either for the Linxes, or for the Thoes. The similitude of the body of this Beast is like to a Lionesses, for so is the face and mouth; The seuerall parts. the lower part of the foreheade, and gnashing or grinning teeth, and all kinde of creatures which are rauening, are footed like a cat, their necke short, and their skins full of spots, not round like a Panthers, nor yet diuers coloured, but altogether of one colour and square, and sometimes long, and therefore this beast and the Panther are of singu∣lar note among all the foure-footed: yet Solinus and Seneca seeme to bee of opinion that their spottes are sometimes of diuers colours both yellow and blacke, and those long like rods in these sayings: Tibi dant variae pectora Tigres. And againe: Vhera viergata faraecaspia. And Cilius saith: Corpore virgato Tigris. It were needlesse to speake of their crooked clawes, their sharpe teeth, and deuided feet, their long taile, Oppianus. agilitye of body, and wildenesse of nature which getteth all their foode by hunting. It hath beene falsely beleeued, that all Tigers be females, and that there are no males among them, and that they engender in copulation with the wind; whereupon Camerarius made this witty riddle in his Rhetorical exercises: A fluuio dicor, fluuius vel dicitur ex me Iuncta{que} sum vento, vento velotior ipso Et mihi dat ventus natos, nec quaero maritos. The Epithits. The Epithites of this beastes are these: Armenian Tigers, sharpe, Ganietican, Hercanian, fierce, cruell, and wicked, vntamed, spotted, diuers-coloured, straked, bitter, rauenous, Affrican, greedy, Caspian, Carcesian, Caucasean, Indean, Parthean, Marsian, streight-foo∣ted, madde, stiffe, fearefull, strong, foaming, and violent, with many such others, as are easie to be found in euery Author. The voice of this beast is cald Ranking, according to this verse: Tigrides indomitae rancant, rugiunt{que} leones. Now because that they are strangers in Europe as we haue saide already, neuer breeding in that part of the world, and as sildome seen, we must be constrained to make but a short story of it, because there are not many diuers thinges concerning the nature of it, and in the physicke none at all. Their food. For the manner of their foode, they prey vppon all the greatest beasts, and sildome vpon the smaller, as Oxen, Harts, and Sheepe, but Hares and Conies they let alone. It is reported by Plutarch, A history of a tame Tiger that was brought vp with a Kid▪ the said kid was killed and laide before him to eat, but he refused it two daies together the third day opressed with extremity of hunger, by her ranking and crying voice made signes to her keeper for other meate, who cast vnto her a cat, which presently it pulled in peeces and deuoured it. The like story vnto this we haue shewed already in the Panther. Gene∣rally the nature of this beast, is according to the Epithites of it, sharpe, vntamed, cruell, and rauenous, neuer so tamed, but sometimes they returne to their former natures, yet the Indians do euery year giue vnto their king tamed Tigers and Panthers, and so it com∣meth to passe, that sometimes the Tiger kisseth his keeper as Seneca writeth. In the time of their lust they are very raging and furious, according to these verses of Virgill : Per sylvas tum saeuus aper, tum pessima Tigris Heu male cum libyae, solis erratur in agris. Their copu∣lation and generation. They ingender as Lyons do, and therefore I maruell how the fable first came, vppe, that they were all females and had no males amonge them, and that the females concei∣ued with young by the West wind, we haue shewed already in the story of the Dogs, that the Indian Dogge is engendered of a Tiger and a Dogge, and so also the Hercanian dogs: Whereby it is apparant, that they do not onely conceiue among themselues, but also in a mingled race. The male is sildome taken, because at the sight of a man hee runneth a∣way, & leaueth the female alone with her yong ones, for he hath no care of the Whelps, and for this occasion I thinke that the fables first came vp that there were no males among the Tigers. The female bringeth forth many at once like a Bitch, which she nourisheth in her den very carefully, louing them, and defending them like a Lionesse from the Hun∣ters, whereby she is many times ensnared and taken. It is reported by Aelianus, that when they heare the sound of Bels and Timbrils, they grow into such a rage and madnesse, that they teare their owne flesh from their backes. For the taking of Tigers, The taking and killing of Tygers. Plutarch Calistines the Indians neare the Riuer Ganges haue a certaine, Hearb growing like Buglosse, which they take and presse the iuyce out of it, this they pre∣serue beside them, and in still silent calme nights, they poure the same down at the mouth of the Tigers den, by vertue whereof it is said the Tigers are continually enclosed, not da∣ring to come out ouer it through some secret opposition in nature, but famish and dye, howling in their caues through intollerable hunger, so great is the swiftnesse of this beast, as we haue shewed already, that some haue dreamed it was conceiued by the wind. For as the swiftest horses and namely the horsses of Dardanus, are likewise fabled to be begot∣ten by the Northern wind, so the Tigers by the West wind. Therfore they are neuer taken but in defence of their yoūg ones, neither is there any beast that liueth vpon preying so swift as they: Solam Tigrim Indis in superabilem esse dicunt, Philostratus quo∣niam fugiendi celeritate, quae ventos equare dicitur, è conspectu aufugit. Onely the Tiger, the Indians say can neuer bee conquered, because when he is hunted he runneth away out of sight as fast as the wind. For this cause they diligently seeke out the caues and dens of the Tigers where there young ones are lodged, and then vpon some swift Horsses they take them and carry them away: when the female Tiger returneth and findeth her den empty, in rage she followeth after them by the foot, whom she quickly ouertaketh, by reason of her celerity. The Hunter seeing her at hand, casteth downe one of her Whelpes: the distressed an∣gry beast knowing that shee can carry but one at once, first taketh vp that in her mouth, without setting vpon the Hunter, contented with that one, returneth with it to her lodg∣ing; hauing layd it vp safe, backe againe she returned like the wind to pursue the Hunter for the residue, who must likewise set her downe another if hee haue not got into his ship, for except the Hunter be neare the Water side, and haue a ship ready, she will fetch them all from him, one by one, or else it wil cost him his life: therfore that enterprise is vnderta∣ken in vaine vpon the swiftest Horses in the World, except the Waters come betwixt the hunter and the Tiger: And the maner of this beast is, when she seeth that her young ones are shipped away, and shee for euer depriued of seeing or hauing them againe, she ma∣keth so great lamentation vpon the Sea shoare howling, braying, and rancking, that ma∣ny times she dyeth in the same place, but if shee recouer all her young ones againe from the hunters, shee departeth with vnspeakeable ioy, without taking any reuenge for their offered iniury. For this occasion, the hunters do deuise certaine round spheares of glasse, wherein they picture their young ones very apparant to be seene by the damme, one of these they cast downe before her at her approch, she looking vppon it, is deluded, and thinketh that her young ones are enclosed therein, and the rather, because through the roundnesse there∣of it is apt to rowle and stir at euery touch, this she driueth along backewards to her den, and there breaketh it with her feete and nailes, and so seeing that she is deceiued, retur∣neth back againe after the hunters for her true Whelps; whilest they in the meane season are safely harbored in some house, or else gone on shipboard. It is reported by Iohannes Ledesma a Spaniard this excellent story of a male & female Tiger. In the Iland Dariene, standing in the oxidental Ocean of the new found world, some 8. daies saile frō Hispaniola, it fell out (saith he) in the yeare of our Lord 1514. that the said Island was annoyed with two Tigers, a male and a female, for halfe a year together, so that there was no night free, but they lost some of their cattell, either a Horsse, or an Oxe, or a Cowe, or a Mare, or a Hog, and swine, and in the time that there young ones did suck, it was not safe for men to go abroad in the day time, much lesse in the night, but they deuoured a Man, if they did not first of al meete with another Beast: At length the countrey thus oppressed, necessity constrained them to deuise a remedy, & to try some meanes to mitigate their calamities, wherefore they sought out all the waies and pathes of the Tigers to and from their dens, that so they might take vengeance vpon the raueners for the losse of so much bloud: At the last they found a common beaten way, this they cut asunder and digged deep into a large dungeon: hauing made the dungeon, they strewed vpon the top of it litle sticks and leaues so couering it to dissemble that which was vnderneath, then came the heedlesse Tiger that way, and fell downe into the ditch vpon such sharp irons stakes and pointed instruments as they had there set, with his roaring he filled all the places thereabout, and the Moun∣taine sounded with the eccho of his roaring voice. The people came vpon him, and casting great & huge stones vpon his back killed him, but first of all, he broke into a thousand pieces, both the stones, Weapons, and Speares, that were cast again him; and so great was his fury, that when he was halfe dead, and the bloud run out of his body, he terrified the standers by beholding and looking vpon him. The male Tiger being thus killed, they followed the footsteps into the Mountaines where the female was lodged, and there in her absence tooke away two of her young ones, yet after∣wards changing their minds, carried them backe againe, putting vpon them two brazen chollers and chaines, and making them fast in the same den that so when they had sucked till they were greater, they might bee with pleasure and safety conuaied into Spain. At last when the time appointed was come that they should be taken forth to be sent away, the people went to the den, wherein they found neither young nor olde, but their chollers fastened in the same place that they had left them, whereby it was conceiued that the en∣uious mother had killed and torne her young ones in pieces, rather then they should fall into the handes of the hunters; so that this beastly loue of hers, ended in horrible cru∣elty, and for this occasion is it that Maedea thus speaketh in Ouid ; Hoc ego si patiar tum me de Tigride natam, Tum ferrum & scopulos gestare in corde videbor. And for this cause it was fained, not without singular wit by the Poets, that such persons as satisfie the fulnesse of their wrath in extremity of reuenge, are transformed into Ty∣gers. The same Poet compareth the wrath of Perseus standing betwixt two aduantages vn∣to a Tiger, betwixt two preies or heards of cattell, being in doubt whether of them to de∣uoure, in this manner; Tigris vt auditis diuersa valle duorum, Extimulata famae mugatbus armentorum, Nescit vtro potius ruat, & ruere ardet vtro{que}, Sic dubius Perseus dextra leuaue feratur. In ancient time these Tigers were dedicated to Bacchus, as all spotted beastes were, and that the said Tygers did draw his Charriot whilest he did hold the raines; therefore Ouid saith thus; Bacchus iu curru quem summum texer at vuis, Tigribus adiunctis aurea lor a dabat. And Horace in this manner; Hac te merentem Bacchipater tuae, Vexere Tigres in docili iugum collo trahentes. Tigers, notwithstanding their great minds and vntamable wildnesse haue been taken, and brought in publike spectacle by men, and the first of all that euer brought them to Rome was Augustus, when Quintus Tubero, and Fabius Maximus were Consuls, at the dedicati∣on of the Theater of Marcellus ; the which Tigers were sent vnto him out of India, for pre∣sentes (as Dion writeth.) Aftervvards Claudius presented foure to the people; and lastly Heleogabalus caused his chariots to be dravvne vvith Tigers, whereunto Martiall alleuded vvhen he saide; Picto quod inga delicata collo, Pardus sustinet improbe{que} Tigres, Indulgent patientiam flagello. Ledesma of whom we spake before affirmeth, Eating of Ti∣gers. that he did eate of the Tigers flesh that was taken in the ditch in the Island Dariene, and that the flesh thereof was nothing inferior to the flesh of an Oxe, but the Indeans are forbidden by the lawes of their Countrey, to eat any part of the Tigers flesh, except the haunches. And thus I will conclude this story of the Tiger, with the Epigram that Martiall made of a Tiger, deuouring of a Lyon. Lambere securi dextram & consueta magistri, Tigris ab Hyrcano glorta rara iugo. Saena ferum rabido lacerauit dente Leonem Res noua non vllis cognita temporibus. Ansa est tale nihil syluis dum vixit in altis. Post quam inter nos est, plus feritatis habet. OF THE VNICORNE. W E are now come to the history of a beast, whereof diuers people in euery age of the worlde haue made great question, because of the rare Vertues thereof; therefore it behooueth vs to vse some dilli∣gence in comparing togither the seuerall testimonies that are spo∣ken of this beast, for the better satisfaction of such as are now aliue, and clearing of the point for them that shall be borne heereafter, whether there bee a Vnicorne; for that is the maine question to be resolued. Now the vertues of the horne, of which we will make a particular discourse by it selfe, haue bin the occasion of this question, and that which doeth giue the most euident testi∣mony vnto all men that haue euer seene it or vsed it, hath bred all the contention; and if there had not bin disclosed in it any extraordinary powers and vertues, we should as easi∣ly beleeue that there was a Vnicorne in the worlde, Many beasts with hornes, improperly called Vni∣cornes. as we do beleeue there is an Elephant although not bred in Europe. To begin therefore with this discourse, by the Vnicorne wee doe vnderstand a peculiar beast, which hath naturally but one horne, and that a very rich one, that groweth out of the middle of the foreheade, for wee haue shewed in other parts of the history, that there are diuers beasts, that haue but one horne, and namely some Oxen in India haue but one horne, and some haue three, and whole hooues. Solinus, Aelianus. Oppranus. Likewise the Buls of Aonia, are saide to haue whole hooues and one horne, growing out of the middle of their foreheads. Likewise in the Citty Zeila of Ethiopia, there are Kine of a purple colour, as Ludouicus Romanus writeth, which haue but one horne growing out of their heads, and that turneth vp towards their backes. Caesar was of opinion that the Elke hadde but one horne, but we haue shewed the contrary. It is said that Pericles had a ram with one horn, but that was bred by way of prodegy, and not naturally. Simeon Sethi writeth, that the Musk ca hath also one horne growing out of the forehead, but we haue shewed already that no man is of that o∣pinion beside himselfe. Aelianus writeth, that there be Birds in Ethiopia hauing one horn on their foreheads, and therefore are cald Vnicornus : and Albertus saith, there is a fish cald Monoceros, and hath also one horne. Now our discourse of the Vnicorne is of none of these beasts, for there is not any vertue attributed to their hornes, and therefore the vul∣gar sort of infidell people which scarcely beleeue any hearbe but such as they see in their owne Gardens, or any beast but such as is in their own flocks, or any knowledge but such as is bred in their owne braines, or any birds which are not hatched in their owne Nests, haue neuer made question of these, but of the true Vnicorne, whereof ther were more proofes in the world, Whether there be any Vnicornes in the World. because of the noblenesse of his horn, they haue euer bin in doubt: by which distraction, it appeareth vnto me that there is some secret enemy in the inward degenerate nature of man, which continually blindeth the eies of God his people, from beholding and beleeuing the greatnesse of God his workes. But to the purpose that there is such a beast, the Scripture it selfe witnesseth, for Dauid thus speaketh in the 92. Psalme: Et erigetur cornu meum tanquam Monocerotis. That is, my horne shall bee lifted vp like the horne of a Vnicorne; whereupon all Diuines that euer wrote haue not onely collected that there is a Vnicorne, but also affirme the similitude to be betwixt the kingdome of Dauid and the horne of the Vnicorne, that as the horne of the Vnicorne is wholesome to all beasts and creatures, so should the kingdome of Dauid be in the generation of Christ; And do we think that Dauid would compare the vertue of his kingdom, & the powerful redemption of the world vnto a thing that is not, or is vncer¦tain and fantastical, God forbid that euer any wise man should so dispight the holy ghost. For this cause also we read in Suidas, that good men which worship God and follow his lawes, are compared to Vnicornes, whose greater parts as their whole bodies are vnpro∣fitable and vntamable, yet their horne maketh them excellent: so in good men, although their fleshly partes be good for nothing, and fall downe to the earth, yet their grace and piety exalteth their soules to the heauens. We haue shewed already in the story of the Rhinocerot, that Reem in Haebrew signifi∣eth a Vnicorne, although Munster be of another opinion yet the Septuagints in the tran∣slation of Deut. 33. do translate it a Vnicorn, for the Rhinocerot hath not one horne, but two. brew in proue cornes Rabbi Solamon, Dauid Kimhi, and Saadius do alwaies take Reem & Karas for a Vnicorn, and they deriue Reem from Rom, which signifieth Altitudinem height, because the Horn of the Vnicorne is lifted vpon high. Hereunto the Arabians agree which call it Barkeron, and the Persians Bark. The Chaldeans Remana. In the 39 of Iob, the Lord speaketh in this maner to Iob: Numquid acquiesset Monoceros vt seruiat tibi, aut vt moretur iuxta prasepia tua? Num quid ligabis Monocerotem fune suo pro sulco faciendo, aut complanabit glenas valli∣um post te. That is to say, will the Vnicorne rest and serue thee, or tarry beside thy cratches? cans thou bind the Vnicorn with a halter to thy plough to make furrows, or will he make plaine the clots of the vallies? Likewise in the prophecy of Esay the 34. chap. and in many other places of Scripture, whereby God himselfe must needs be traduced, if there be no Vnicorne in the world. Besides the Arabians, as And. Bellun. writeth, call this beast Alcherceden, and say that it hath one horne in the forehead which is good against poysons. The Graetians call it Monokeros, from whence Pliny and all the ancient Grammarians doe call it Monoceros, yet the deuines both elder and later do name it by a more learned proper Latin word Vnicor∣nis. The Italians Alicorno, Vnicorno, Liocorno, Leocorno the French Licorne, the Spaniards Vnicornio, The hands of Vnicornes the Germans Einhorne, and the Illirians Gednorozecz: And thus much for the name. All our Eropean Authors which write of beastes, do make of the Vnicorne diuers kindes, especially Pliny, Ludouicus Romanus, Paulus Venetus, Nicholaus Venetus, Aeneas Sylutus, Albertus Magnus, out of whose words we must gather the best description that we can of the Vnicorne. The Arcean Indians (saith Pliny) do hunt a certaine wild beast which is very curst vntamable, hauing one horne, which in the head resembleth a Hart, in the feet an Elephant, in the taile a Bore, and in the residue of the body a Horse: Countries of Vnicorns. the horne he saith, is about two cubits long, and the voice like the lowing of of an Oxe, somewhat more shrill, and they deny that this beast is ever taken aliue. Aelianus writeth herof in this man∣ner, there are (saith he) certaine Mountaines in the middest of India, vnto the which the passage is very difficult, where are abundance of wild beasts, & among other Vnicornes, which the Indians call Cartazonons, who in their ripe age are as big as a Horsse, and their mane and haires are yellow, excelling in the celerity of their feet and bodies, hauing feet clouen like an Elephants, the taile of a Boate, and one blacke horne growing out betwixt their eie-browes, not smooth, but rough all ouer with wrinckles, and the same groweth to a most sharp point, these thinges (saith Aelianus, ) by comparing of whose wordes with Pliny, it is apparant they describe in these words but one and the same beast, and so also doth Phyles ; wherby I gather, that it is no other beast then the wilde Asse, or at the least the wilde Asse commeth nearest to the Vnicorne of all others, for they agree in these thinges, first, in that both of them haue one horn in the middle of the forehead, second∣ly, in that both of them are bred in India, thirdly, in that they are both about the bignesse of a Horsse, fourthly in their celerity and solitary life, fiftly and lastly in their exceeding strength and vntamable natures; but herein they differ both in their feet and colours, for the feet of the wilde Asses are whole and not clouen like the Vnicornes, and their colour white in their body, and purple on their head; and Aelianus saith, that the horne also diffe∣reth in colour from the Vnicornes, for the middle of it is onely blacke, the roote of it white, and the top of it purple, which Bellonius doth interpret, that the superficies or vp∣per face of the Horne is all purple, the inner parte white, and the inward part or middle blacke; but of this Indian wilde Asse we haue spoken already, and therefore I will adde no∣thing in this place but the words of Philostratus in the life of Apolonius, who writeth in this manner. There are many wilde Asses which are taken in the Fens, neare the riuer Hiphasis, in whose forehead there is one horne, wherewith they fight like Buls, and the Indians of that horne make pots, affirming that whosoeuer drinketh in one of those pots, shall neuer take disease that day, and if they bee wounded shall feele no paine, or safely passe through the fire without burning, nor yet be poysoned in their drinke, and therefore such cuppes are only in the possession of their Kings, neither is it lawfull for any man except the King, to hunt that beast, and therefore they say that Appollonius looked vpon one of those beastes, and considered his nature with singular admiration. Now there was one Damis in his company, who asked him whether he did beleeue that the vulgar report of the Vnicorns hornes were true or no, Appollonius made him this aun∣swer: Ad hibeo si huius regionis immortalem regemesse intellexero, qui enim mihi aut alteri cui quam poculum ita salubre potest dare, nónne veri simile est ipsum quotidie illo vti, & ex eo cor∣nu frequenter vel ad crapulam vs{que} bibere, nemo enim vt puto illum caluminiabitur qui in tali poculo etiam inebrietur. That is to say, I would beleeue that report if I found in this coun∣try a king that were immortall and could neuer dye, for if a man would giue me such a cup or any other man, do not you thinke that I would beleeue he drunke in the same cup? and who would blame a man if he drunke in such a cup till he were drunk, for it were lawful to vse that horne vnto surfetting, whereby we may gather the mind of that wise man concer∣ning the Asses horn, and the Vnicorns; namely, that they may giue one some ease against accidentall diseases, although they cannot prolong a mans life the space of one day: these things said he. There be beastes (saith Aristotle ) as the Oryx and Indian Asse, which are armed vvith one horne, and the clouen footed Orix is no other then the vvhole footed Asse, for in the middle of their forehead they haue one horn, by which both sides of their head are armed, Cum mediū pariter comune vtri{que} extremo sit. Because the middle is equally distant from both the extreames, and the hoofe of this beast may wel be said to be clouen and whole, because the horne is of the substance of the hoofe, and the hoofe of the sub∣stance of the Horne, and therefore the horne is vvhole, and the Hoofe clouen; for the cleauing either of the horne or of the hoofe commeth through the defect of nature, and therefore God hath giuen to Horsses and Asses whole hooues, because there is grea∣test vse of their Legges, but vnto Vnicornes a whole and entire Horne, that as the ease of men is procured by the helpes of Horsses, so the health of them is procured by the horne of the Vnicorne: The vse of a Vnicornes horne. These things (saith Aristotle, ) And Strabo also writeth, that there are Hor∣ses in India, which haue Harts heades, with one horne, of which horne their Princes make Cups, out of which they drinke their drinke against poyson, and therefore by this which hath beene sayd it appeareth vnto me, that either the Indian Asse is a Vnicorne, or differeth from it only in colour; and the obiection of the hooues is aunswered by Aristotle. Vnto this discourse I will adde the trauailes of Ludouicus Roman, wherein he saw two Vnicornes at Mecha in Arabia, where Mauhomets Temple and Sepulcher is. There are preserued (saith he) within the walles and Cloysters of that Temple two Vnicornes, which by way of miracle they bring forth to the people, and truely not without cause for the sight is wor∣thy of admiration. Now their description is on this sort: one of them and the elder was about the stature of a Colt of two yeares and a halfe olde, hauing a horne growing out of his forehead of two cubits length, and the other was much lesse, for it was but a year old, and like a Colt of that age, whose Horne was some foure spans long, or there abouts. The colour of them was like a Weaseled-coloured-horse, the head like the head of a Hart, the neck not long, and the mane growing all on one side. The Legges slender and leane, like the Legges of a Hinde, the hooues of the forefeet were clouen like a Goates feete, and the hinder Legges are all hairy and shaggy with the outside; the Beastes although they were wilde, yet by Art or superstition, they seemed to be tempered with no great wildnesse, and it was saide that the King of Ethiopia, did send them to the Sultan of Mecha, with whom he is constrained, to obserue perpetuall amity. Now these Vnicornes are of another kinde then the Vnicornes of Pliny and Aelianus, be∣cause their Vnicorn hath a whole Hoofe, and this clouen, but this obiection was answered before: and although Pliny & Aristotle do acknowledge no other Vnicorne then the Orix, whose Horne is blacke, as hard as Iron, and sharp at the point, yet it is cleare that there is another Vnicorne besides that. Now Paulus Venetus saith, that in the kingdome of Basman, which is subiect to the great Cham, that there are Vnicornes somewhat lesser then Elephants, hauing haire like Oxen, heads, like Boares, feet like Elephantes, one Horne in the middle of their foreheads, and a sharp thorny tongue, wherewith they destroy both man and Beast, and besides head∣deth, that they muddle in the durt like Swine. Now if it were not for the Horne in the middle of the forehead, I would take this Beast for a Rhinocerot, but because the Horn of the Rhinocerot groweth out of the Nose, I deeme this to be a second kinde of Vnicorne, for there is no man that shall read this story, but will thinke that the learned Authour had reason to discerne betwixt the eies and the forehead, and therefore there can be no excep∣tion taken to my obseruation. Nicolaus Venetus an Earle saith, that in Masinum or Serica, that is, the Mountaines be∣twixt India and Cathay, (as Aeneas Syluius writeth) there is a certain Beast hauing a Svvines head, an Oxes taile, the body of an Elephant (vvhom it doth not onely equall in stature, but also it liueth in continuall variance vvith them) and one horne in the forehead: now this if the Reader shall thinke it different from the former, I doe make the thirde kinde of a Vnicorn, and I trust there is no Wise-man that wil be offended at it: for as we haue shewed already in many stories, that sundry Beastes haue not onely their diuisions, but subdeui∣sions, into subalternal kinds, as many Dogges, many Deere, many Horsses, many Mice, many Panthers, and such like, why should there not also bee many Vnicorns. And if the Reader be not pleased vvith this, let him either shew me better reason, (which I know hee shall neuer be able to do) or else beside least the vttering of his dislike, bewray enuy and ignorance. Other dis∣courses of the horne. Novv although the parts of the Vnicorne be in some measure described, and also their Countrys, namely, India and Ethiopia, yet for as much as al is not said as may be said, I will adde the residue in this place: And first of al there are two kingdomes, in India one called Niem, and the other Lamber or Lambri ; both these are stored vvith Vnicornes: And Aloisius Cadamustus in his fifty Chapter of his booke of nauigation, writeth that there is a certaine region of the new found world, wherein are found liue Vnicornes; and to∣ward the East, and South, vnder the Equinoctiall there is a liuing creature (with one horne which is crooked, and not great) hauing the head of a Dragon, and a beard vpon his chin, his necke long, and stretched out like a Serpents, the residue of his body like to a Harts, sauing that his feete, colour, and mouth are like a Lyons: Pbiles. and this also (if not a fable or rather a monster) may be a fourth kinde of Vnicorne; And concerning the hornes of Vnicornes, now we must performe our promise, which is to relate the true hi∣storie of them, as it is found in the best writers. This therefore growing out of the fore∣head betwixt the eye lids is neither light nor hollow, nor yet smooth like other hornes, but hard as Iron (rough as any file) reuolued into many plights, sharper than any darte, straight and not crooked, and euery where blacke except at the point. There are two of these at Venice in the Treasurie of S. Markes Church, as Brasavolus writeth, one at Argentarat, which is wreathed about with diuers sphires. There are also two in the Treasurie of the King of Polonia, all of them as long as a man in his stature. In the yeare 1520. there was found the horne of a Vnicorne in the riuer Arrula, neare Bruga in Heluetia, the vpper face or out-side whereof was a darke yellow, it was two cubites in length, but had vpon it no plights or wreathing versuus. It was very odoriferous (especi∣ally when any part of it was set one fire) so that it smelled like muske: as soone as it was found, it was carried to a Nunnery called Campus regius, but afterwardes by the Gouer∣nor of Heluetia it was recouered backe againe, because it was found within his teritorie. Now the vertues of this horne are already recited before, and yet I will for the better iustifiyng of that which I haue said concerning the Vnicornes horne, adde the testimony of our learned men which did write thereof to Gesner, whose letters according as I find them recorded in his worke, so I haue here inserted and translated word for word. And first of all the answere of Nicholas Gerbelius vnto his Epistle, concerning the Vnicornes horne at Argentoratum, is this which followeth, for, saith he, The horne which those No∣blemen haue in the secrets of the great Temple, I haue often seene and handled with my hands; It is of the length of a tall man, if so be that you shall thereunto adde the point thereof: for there was a certaine euill disposed person among est them, who had learned (I know not of whom) that the point or top of the same horne would be a present remedy both against all poyson, and also against the plague or pestilence: Wherefore that sacri∣legious theefe, plucked off the higher part or top from the residue, being in length three or foure fingers. For which wicked offence, both he himselfe was cast out of that company, and not any euer afterwards of that family might be receaued into this society by an ordinance graue∣ly and maturely ratified. This pulling off of the top brought a notable deformitie to that most splendant gift. The whole horne from that part which sticketh to the forehead of this beast, euen vnto the top of the horne is altogether firme or solide, not gaping with chops, chinks or creuises, with a litle greater thicknes then a tile is vsua;lly amongst vs. For I haue often times comprehended almost the whole horne in my right hand. From the roote vnto the point it is euen as wax candles are rowled together most elegantly seue∣red and raised vp in little lines. The waight of this horne of so great a massinesse, that a man would hardly beleeue it, and it hath beene often wondred at, that a beast of so little a stature could beare so heauy and weighty a burden. I could neuer smell any sweetnesse at all therein. The colour thereof is like vnto old yuory, in the midst betwixt white and yellow. But you shall neuer haue a better patterne of this, then where it is sold in litle peeces or fragments by the oile∣men. For the colour of our horne is life vnto them, But by whom this was giuen vnto that same temple I am altogether ignorant. Another certaine friend of mine, being a man worthy to be beleeued, Gerbellius A second hi∣story of a V∣nicorns horn declared vnto me, that he saw at Paris with the Chancellor, being Lord of Pratus, a peece of a Vnicorns horne, to the quantity of a cubit, wreathed in tops or spires, about the thickenesse of an indifferent staffe (the compasse therof extending to the quantity of six fingers) being with∣in and without of a muddy colour, with a solide substance, the fragments whereof woulde boile in the Wine although they were neuer burned, hauing very little or no smell at all therein. When Ioannes Ferrerius of Piemont had read these thinges, he wrote vnto me, that in the Temple of Dennis, neare vnto Paris, that there was a Vnicornes horne six foot-long, wherin all those things which are written by Gerbelius in our chronicles were verified both the weight and the colour: but that in bignesse it exceeded the horne at the Citty of Ar∣gentorate, being also holow almost a foot from that part which sticketh vnto the forehead of the Beast, this he saw himselfe in the Temple of S. Dennis, and handled the horne with his handes as long as he would. A third Hy∣story of a Vnicornes horne. I heare that in the former yeare (which was from the yeare of our Lord 1553. when Vercella was ouerthrown by the French, there was broght from that treasure vnto the King of France, a very great Vnicorns horne, the price wher∣of was valued at fourscore thousand Duckets. Paulus Poaeius, describeth an Vnicorne in this manner; Another de∣scription of the Vnicorn. That he is a beast, in shape much like a young Horse, of a dusty colour, with a maned necke, a hayry beard, and a forehead armed with a horne of the quantity of two cubits, being seperated with pale tops or spires, which is reported by the smoothnes and yuorie whitenesse thereof, to haue the wonderfull power of dissoluing and speedy expel∣ling of all venome or poison whatsoeuer. For his horne being put into the water, driueth away the poison, that hee may drinke without harme, if any venomous beast shall drinke therein before him. This cannot be taken from the Beast being aliue, forasmuch as he canot possible be taken by any deceit: yet it is vsually seene that the horne is found in the desarts, as it happeneth in Harts, who cast off their olde horne thorough the inconueniences of old age, which they leaue vnto the Hunters, Nature renewing an other vnto them. The horne of this beast being put vpon the Table of Kinges, and set amongst their iun∣kets and bankets, doeth bewray the venome if there be any suche therein, by a certaine sweat which commeth ouer it. Concerning these hornes, there were two seene, which were two cubits in length, of the thicknesse of a mans Arme, the first at Venice, which the Senate afterwards sent for a gift vnto Solyman the Turkish Emperor: the other being al∣most of the same quantity, and placed in a Syluer piller, with a shorte or cutted paint, which Clement the Pope or Bishop of Rome, being come vnto Marssels, broght vnto Frā∣cis the King for an excellent gift. Furthermore concerning the vertue of such a gifte, I will not speake more of this beast, then that which diuulged fame doeth perswade the be∣leeuers. Petrus Bellonius writeth, that he knewe the tooth of some certaine Beast in time past, sold for the horne of a Vnicorne, Of adultera∣ted Vnicorns horns. (what beast may be signified by this speech I know not, neither any of the French men which do liue amongst vs) and so a smal peece of the same being adulterated sold sometimes for 300. Duckets. But if the horne shalbe true and not counterfait, it doth notwithstanding seeme to be of that creature which the Auncientes called by the name of an Vnicorne, especially Aelianus, who only ascribeth to the same this wonderfull force against poyson and most grieuous diseases, for he maketh not this horne white as ours doth seeme, but outwardly red, inwardly white, and in the middest or secrettest part only blacke. But it cannot bee denied, that this our Vnicornes horne was taken from some liuing wilde Beast. For their are found in Europe to the number of twenty of these hornes pure, and so many broken; two of the which are showne in the treasury of Saint Markes church at Venice (I heard that the other was of late sent vnto the Emperor of the Turkes for a gift by the Venetians ) both of them about the length of six cubits: the one part which is lowest being thicker, and the other thinner, that which is thicker, exceedeth not the thicknesse of three inches iust, which is also attributed vnto the horne of the Indian Asse, but the o∣ther notes of the same are wanting. I doe also know, that which the King of England possesseth to be wreathed inspires, e∣uen as that is accounted in the Church of S. Dennis, then which they suppose none grea∣ter in the world, and I neuer saw any thing in any creatures more worthy praise then this horn. The substance is made by nature, not Art, wherin al the marks are found which the true horne requireth. And forsomuch as it is somewhat hollowe (about the measure of a foot which goeth out of the head, & the bone growing from the same is comprehended) I coniecture that it neuer falleth, as neither the hornes of a Muskcat, a wilde Goat, and an Ibex do: but the hornes of these beasts do yearely fall off, namely, the Bucke, the Hart, Field-goat, and Camelopardall. It is of so great a length, that the tallest man can scarsely touch the top thereof, for it doth fully equall seuen great feet. It weigheth thirteen pounds with their assize, being only weighed by the gesse of the hande, it seemeth much heauier. The figure doth plainely signifie a wax candle, (being folded a wreathed within it selfe) beeing farre more thicker from one part, and making it selfe by little and little lesse to∣wards the point, the thickest part thereof cannot be shut within ones hand, it is the com∣passe of fiue fingers, by the circumference, if it bee measured with a thred, it is three fin∣gers and a span. That part, which is next vnto the heade hath no sharpenesse, the other are of a polished smoothnes. The splents of the spire are smooth and not deep, being for the most part like vnto the wreathing turnings of Snailes, or the reuolutions or windings of Wood-bine a∣bout any wood. But they proceed from the right hande toward the left, from the begin∣ning of the horne, euen vnto the very ende. The colour is not altogether white, being a long time somewhat obscured. But by the weight it is an easie thinge to coniecture, that this beast which can beare so great burden in his head, in the quantity of his body can bee little lesse then a great Oxe. There are found oftentimes in Polonia certaine hornes which some men gesse to be of the Vnicorns, by a doubble Argument. First, because they are found seuerall, Of the Vni∣cornes horns found in Po∣lonia. neuer by twaines which as yet is heard, although sometimes they may be found with the scull and bones of the rest of the body: furthermore because their strength or vertue is approued against great and most grieuous diseases: concerning which thing Antonius Schnebergerus a Phisitian of great learning amongst the Sarmatians, and an excellent obseruer of nature, writ vnto me some fiue yeare past, to see some of these hornes, hauing sent them by the labour of my very good friend Ioachinnus Rhaeticus, a most excellent phisitian in Sarmatia, and incomparable in the mathematick Artes in this age. The first of these hornes (saith hee) I sawe being of the length of my fadome, with a duskishe or darkish colour: the point there of being exceeding sharpe and smooth. The compasse about the root of the horne did exceed six spans. The outside was plaine, with no turnings of spires: the substance easie to be crummed, the figure crooked, the colour exceeding white within, which if it be drunk in wine, doth draw ouer it selfe a dark colour. Eight such diuisions were ioyned to the same, as you shall see in the greater part which I send, but that part is not of the horn, but either the entrance of the pallat, or some other things as I coniecture. This horne was found vnder the earth, (not deeper then a foote, in a solitary and high place, as betweene two hils, through which a riuer runneth,) by Countri'men that were digging to lay the foundation of a house. But the horne was smitten with an Axe, and se∣uered into very smal peeces: but that Noble and excelent man Ioannes Frikasz (in whose field the horne was founde, being distaunt from Cracouia two miles) by all diligence he could, least that the small peeces should be cast abroad, tooke deliberate heed, that they should be taken out of the earth. From the roote to the top it was all round and smooth, but touching it with ones toongue, it cleaueth fast vnto it, the tooth was as big as a man could gripe in his hand, being in the vpper or outward part bony or hollow within, white in the middle, and toward the end somewhat reddish. But there was found all the beast, as by the greatnesse of his bones might easily be per∣ceived, being bigger in quantity then a horse. It is most certaine that it was a Foure-foo∣ted-beast, by the bones of the shoulders, thighes and ribs. But if this Horne were the tooth of an Elephant, as some doe suppose, you would maruaile why two (which I haue heard) were neuer found together. But the teeth or rather hornes of Elephants are nei∣ther so crooked that they might come almost to halfe a circle as they did. The strength of this horne a penny weight thereof being put in wine or water of Borrage, healeth old Feuers, as also Tertian or quarterne Agues of three yeares continuance, and cureth ma∣ny diseases in mens bodies, as asswaging the paine of the belly, and making of those to vomit, who can by no meanes ease their stomackes. Hitherto shal suffice to haue spoken concerning one of those foure hornes which I saw. The other was like vnto this, but lesse pure; for the colour was outwardly most blacke, inwardly most white, being found in the Riuer. The third, and fourth most hard, so that a man would thinke it were by the touch∣ing thereof stone or iron, being solide euen vnto the point, for I haue not seene them wholly, but the part of one, to the length of a cubit; of the other, to the length of halfe a cubit with a darke colour, being almost of the same thicknesse as the two former: But for as much as the two former haue no riftes or chinkes in them, these haue by their longi∣tude, being like hearbs bending or wreathing in their stalkes. There was another found in a certaine field, so much appearing out of the earth, that the rude or country sort did thinke it to be some pile or stake. Many also are cured and freed from shaking feauers by the medicinall force of these, the cause whereof I suppose to be this, because the former are softer, for as much as one of them will lye in the Wa∣ter for so long a time, but the other vnder the earth being scarce well hid. I afterwardes saw a filt like vnto the first, none of them being straight or direct vppe, but also crooked some almost vnto a halfe a circle: Hitherto Schnebergerus, who also addeth this. That there are more of these to be found in Polonia, and therefore for the most part to bee contem∣ned. There are moreouer found in Heluetia some of these hornes: one in the riuer Arula a∣gainst the Towne of Bruga, the other in the last yeare, in the riuer of Birsa, but it was bro∣ken, euen as the third with that famous Earle of the Cymbrians, William Warner in a tower neare vnto the Citty Rottauit, who gaue vnto Gesner a good peece thereof, who found an∣other peece as he was a fishing at Birsa in the riuer. And it is no great maruaile that they are found there, where through length of time they are broken into small pieces, and car∣ried by the force of the waters into diuers places. But it is most diligently to be obserued, whether they are found in the earth, as also to be knowne whether that great horne be of this beast, which hangs alone in the great tem∣ple at Argentaur, by the piller, for it hath hanged there many yeares before, as now it-appeareth, for that doth plainely seeme the same magnitude, thicknesse, and figure which Schnebergerus hath described in his own horne that we haue allowed before for wild oxen. The ancients haue attributed singuler hornes to the Vnicorne, whom some haue cald by other names as it is said: and furthermore to the Orix (a wilde beast vnknowne in our age except I be deceiued) which Aristotle and Pliny call a Vnicorne, Aelianus a Quadrucorne. Oppianus doth not expresse it, but he seemeth to make it a two horned beast. Simeon Sethi doth also write that the Musk-cat or Goat at which bringeth forth Muske, hath one horne. Certaine later writers (as Scaliger reporteth) say, that there is a certaine Oxe in Ethiopia which hath one Horne comming out in the middest of his forehead, greater then the length of a foot, bending vpwardes, the point being wreathed ouerthwart, and they haue red haire, whereby we gather that the horne of all Vnicornes is not pure. But the reason why these hornes are more found in Polonia then in any other place, I cannot well ghesse, whether from thence we shall suspect them to be of certaine Vries, which at this day abide in the woods of Sarmatia ; in times past, there were many more, which haue liued both in greater and larger woods, neither were they killed with so often Hunting: some whereof it is most like haue come to great age, as appeareth by their great & stately hornes, which things we leaue to be considered of others. I suppose that the Apothe caries neuer haue the true horne of a Vnicorne, but that some doe sell a kinde of false adulterated Horne, o∣ther the fragments of this great and vnknowne Horne, of which we haue spoken, and not onely of the horne, but also of the bones of the head; some of which are so affected by longanimity of time, that you may take a threefold substance in them, although it be bro∣ken by a certain distance, one being for the most part whitish and pale, the other whiter and softer, the third stony and most white. I heare that in the new Ilands there was a Horne bought in the name of a Vnicornes horne, being much praised for expelling of poyson: which what it is I haue not as yet ex∣amited, but it is to bee inquired, whether it bee a Rhynocerots or not, for both the aun∣cient and late Writers doe mingle this with the Vnicorne. I doe verily coniecture that the same strength is pertinent to both the Hornes. And thus much shall suffice concerning the true Vnicornes horne, and the Vertues ari∣sing there from. In this place now we will proceed to the residue of the history, reseruing other vses of this horne to the proper medicines. These Beasts are very swift, and their legges haue no Articles. The naturall properties of Vnicornes They keep for the most part in the desarts, and liue solitary in the tops of the Mountaines. There was nothing more horible thē the voice or braying of it, for the voice is straind aboue measure. It figh∣teth both with the mouth and with the heeles, with the mouth biting like a Lyon, and with the heeles kicking like a Horse. It is a beast of an vntamable nature, and therefore the Lord himselfe in Iob saith that he cannot bee tyed with any halter, nor yet accustomed to any cratch or stable. Hee feareth not Iron or any yron Instrument, (as Isidorus writeth) and that which is most strange of all other, it fighteth with his owne kinde, yea euen with the females vnto death, except when it burneth in lust for procreation; but vnto straunger-Beasts, with whome he hath no affinity in nature, he is more sotiable and familiar, deligh∣ting in their company when they come willing vnto him, neuer rising against them, but proud of their dependence and retinue, keepeth with them all quarters of league & truce, Philes. Aelianus. but with his female, when once his flesh is tickled with lust, he groweth tame, gregall and louing, and so continueth till she is filled and great with young, and then returneth to his former hostility. He is an enemy to the Lyons, wherefore as soone as euer a Lyon seeth a Vnicorne, he runneth to a tree for succor, that so when the Vnicorne maketh force at him, hee may not onely auoide his horne, but also destroy him; for the Vnicorne in the the swiftnesse of his course runneth against the tree wherein his sharpe horne sticketh fast, then when the Lyon seeth the Vnicorne fastned by the horne without all danger, he fau∣leth vpon him and killeth him. These things are reported by the king of Aethiopia, in an Haebrew Epistle vnto the Bishop of Rome. It is sayd that Vnicorns aboue all other creatures, doe reuerence Virgines and young Maides, and that many times at the sight of them they growe tame, The taking of Vnicornes and come and sleepe beside them, for there is in their nature a certaine sauor, wherewithall the Vnicornes are allured and delighted: for which occasion the Indian and Ethiopian hunters vse this stra∣tagem to take the beast. They take a goodly strong and beautifull young man, Albertus. Alunnus. Tzetzes. whom they dresse in the apparrell of a woman, besetting him with diuers odoriferous flowers and spi∣ces. The man so adorned, they set in the Mountaines or Woods where the Vnicorne hun∣teth, so as the wind may carrie the sauour to the beast, and in the meane season the other hunters hide themselues: the Vnicorne deceaued with the outward shape of a woman and sweete smells, commeth vnto the young man without feare, and so suffereth his head to bee couered and wrapped within his large sleeues, neuer stirring but lying still and a sleepe, as in his most acceptable repose. Then when the hunters by the signe of the young man perceaue him fast and secure, they come vppon him, and by force cut off his horne and send him away aliue: but concerning this opinion wee haue no elder authoritie then Tzetzes, who did not liue aboue fiue hundred yeares agoe, and therefore I leaue the rea∣der to to the freedome of his owne iudgment, to beleeue or refuse this relation; neither was it fit that I should omit it, seeing that all writers since the time of Tzetzes, doe most constantly beleeue it. It is sayd by Aelianus and Albertus, that except they bee taken before they bee two yeares old they will neuer bee tamed; and that the Thrasians doe yeerely take some of their Colts, and bring them to their King, which he keepeth for combat, & to fight with one another: for when they are old, they differ nothing at all from the most barborous, bloodie, and rauenous beasts. Their, flesh is not good for meate, but is bitter and vnnou∣rishable: And thus much shall suffice for the naturall storie of the Vnicorne, now follow∣eth the medicinall. The medicine arising from the Vnicorne. Concerning the hornes of the Vnicorne, I haue sufficiently already written, as the auntientes haue deliuered in their remedies: but in this place I will handle the remedies which late writers haue attributed thereunto, as also our owne obseruations of the same I remember that in times past, I saw a peece of this horn of the weight of nine inches with a certaine Merchant in the marker, being blacke and plaine, and not wreathed in circles or turnings, but at that time I did not so much obserue it. Now amongst our Apothe∣caries I do not onely find smal or little fragments, out of which they yssued (as they say) some certaine marrow, which are rounder, whiter, and softer. But both the same colour, as also the substance being put too much, and eaten, if it be easily crummed, and not stuft as other hornes, doeth signifie the same not to be good or perfect, but counterfetted and corrupted: as perhaps the horne of some other beast brent in the fire, some certaine sweet odors being thereunto added, and also imbrued in some delicious or aromaticall perfume; peraduenture also Bay by this means, first burned, and afterward quenched or put out with certaine sweet smelling liquors. There is great care to be had, that it be taken new, and while it smelleth sweete, not either abolished by age, nor the vertue thereof deminished by often or frequent cups. For rich men do vsually cast little peeces of this horne in their drinking cups, either for the preuenting or curing of some certaine disease. There are also some which enclose it in gold or siluer, and so cast it in their drinke, as though the force thereof could remaine many yeares, notwithstan∣ding the continuall soking in wine. But that which is so vsed and drunke in wine doth bring vpon it a certaine dark or ob∣scure colour, the whitenesse which before remained vppon the same being quite lost, ex∣pelled, and vtterly abolished. Most men for the remedies arising from the same, com∣maund to vse the horne simply by it selfe: Others prefer the marrowe therein. It being cast in wine doth boyle, which some men either through ignorance or deceipt, impute to be a signe of the true horne, when as contrarily any other hornes being brent, do in wa∣ter or wine cause bubles to arise. There are some wicked persons which do make a mingle mangle thereof, as I sawe amongst the Venetians (being as I heare say, compounded with lime and sope) or peraduenture with earth or some stone: (which things are wont to make bubles arise) and afterwards fell it for the Vnicornes horne. Wherefore it shall be more safe to buy it out of the whole horne if it may be done, or of greater crums, and which may well describe the figure of a horne, then smal fragments where you may receiue lesse deceit. A certaine Apothecary which was at Noramberg, in a stately mart towne amongst the Germans, declared the way vnto me how to deface the colour of an adulterated Vnicornes horne, being made by some with Iuory, either mace∣rated or boyled with certaine medicines (by Set-foile as I suppose, and other things) by which meanes hauing scraped it, I found within the true substance to be yuory. Antonius Brasauol s writeth, that all men for the most part doe sell a certaine stone for Vnicornes horne, which truely I deny not to be done, who haue no certainty there in my selfe: not∣withstanding also it may come to passe, that a very hard and solid horne, about the point of a sword especially (which part is preferred to inferior, as also in Harts horns) to which either stones or yron may yeild, such as authors attribut to the Rhinocerot. And other Vni∣cornes may bear the shape of a stone before it selfe. For if Orpheus concerning Harts horns rightly doubted, whether the same or stones were of greatest strength: I think it more to be doubted in the kind of Vnicornes, for the hornes of Harts are not onely solide (as Ari∣stotle supposed) but also the hornes of Vnicornes, as heere I haue said. The horne of an Vnicorne is at this day vsed, although age or longinquity of time bath quite abolished it from the nature of a horne. There are some which mingle the Rhi∣noceros with the Vnicorne, for that which is named the Rhinoceros horne, is at this day in phisical vse, of which notwithstanding the Authours haue declared no effectual force. Some say that the Vnicornes horn doth sweat, hauing any poison comming ouer it, which is false, it doth perhaps sometimes sweat, euen as some solide, hard, and light substance, (as also stones and glasse) some external vapor being about them, but this doeth nothing appertaine to poison. It is in like manner reported, that a kind of stone called the serpents toong doth sweat hauing poison come ouer it. I haue heard and read in a certaine booke written with ones hands, that the true horne of a Vnicorne is to be proued in this maner. To giue to two Pi∣geons poyson (red Arsnick or Orpin) the one which drinketh a litle of the true Vnicorns horne will be healed, the other will die, I do leaue this manner of tryall vnto rich men. For the price of that which is true, is reported this day to bee of no lesse vallew then Gold. Some do sel the waight thereof for a floren, or eight pence: some for a crowne, or twelue pence. But the marrow thereof is certainely of a greater price, then that which is of harder substance. Some likewise do sel a dram thereof, for two pence halfe penny, so great is the diuersity thereof. For experience of the Vnicornes horne to know whether it be right or not: put silke vpon a burning cole, and vpon the silke the aforsaid horne, and if so be that it be true the silke will not be a whit consumed. The hornes of Vnicorns, especially that which is brought from new Islands, being bea∣ten and drunk in water, doth wonderfully help against poyson: as of late experience doth manifest vnto vs a man, who hauing taken poison and beginning to swell was preserued by this remedy. I my selfe haue herd of a man worthy to be beleeued, that hauing eaten a poisond cherry, and perceiuing his belly to swell, he cured himself by the marrow of this horne being drunke in wine in very short space. The same is also praised at this day for the curing of the falling sicknes, and affirmed by Aelianus, who called this disease cursed. The ancient writers did attribute the force of hea∣ling to cups made of this horne, wine being drunke out of them: but because we cannot haue cups, we drinke the substance of the horn, either by it selfe or with other medicines. I happily sometime made this Sugar of the horne, as they call it, mingling with the same Amber, iuory dust, leaues of gold, Corall, and certaine other things, the horne being in∣cluded in silke, and beaten in the decoction of razens and Cinamon, I cast them in water, the rest of the reason of healing in the mean time not being neglected. It is morouer com¦mēded of Physitians of our time against the pestilent feauer, (as Aloisius Mundella writeth) against the the bitings of rauenous Dogs, and the strokes or poyson some stings of other creatures: and priuately in rich mens houses against the belly or mawe wormes; to con∣clude, it is giuen against all poyson whatsoeuer, as also against many most grieuous disea∣ses. The King of the Indians drinking out of a cuppe made of an Indian Vnicorns horne, and being asked wherefore he did it, whether it were for the loue of drunkennesse, made answer, that by that drinke drunkennesse was both expelled and resisted, and worser things cured, meaning that it cleane abolished al poyson whatsoeuer. The horne of an Vnicorn, doth heale that detestable disease in men called S. Iohns euill, otherwise the cursed disease. The horne of an Vnicorne being beaten and boyled in wine, hath a wonderful effect in ma∣king the teeth white or cleare, the mouth being well clensed therewith. And thus much shall suffice for the medicines and vertues arising from the Vnicorne. OF THE VRE-OXE. T His Beast is called by the Latins Vrus, by the Germans Aurox, The seueral names. and Vrox, and Grosse vesent, by the Lituanians Thur, the Scythians Bu∣bri, and these beastes were not knowne to the Graecians, (as Pliny writeth) of whom Seneca writeth in this manner; Tibi dant variae pectora tigres, Tibi villosi terga Bisontes, Latis{que} feri cornibus vri. And Virgill also maketh mention of them in this Georguke, writing of the culture or tilling of vines; Texendae saepes etiam & pecus omne tenendum: Precipue cum fons tenera, imprudens{que} laborum, Cui semper indignas hyemes, solem{que} potentem. Siluestres vrt assidue, capreae{que} sequaces, Illudunt. These wilde beasts or Vre-oxes are wilde Oxen, differing from all other kindes already rehearsed in the story of Oxen, Bugles, Bisons, or any other, although some haue vnskil∣fully taken them for Bisons, and Sir Thomas Eliot in his Dictionary, doth English Vrus a Bugil, but beside him no body, that I know, and for this cause he is reprehended by o∣ther. Now although there be nothing in this beast but ordinary, yet seeing it is a creature so well knowne, we haue the lesse reason to omit his shape and story, least we should iustly be condemned of negligence and carelesnesse. In outward proportion of the body it differeth little from the Bull, It is very thick, and his back somewhat bunched vp, and his length from the head to the taile is short, no waies answerable to the proportion of his stature and sides: the horns (as some say) are but short, yet blacke, The seueral partes broad, and thicke, his eies red, a broad mouth, and a great broade head, his temples hairy, a beard vpon his chin, but short, and the colour thereof blacke, his other parts, as namely in the face, sides, legs, and taile, of a reddish colour. These are in the wood Hercynia, in the Pyreney Mountaines, and in Mazouia neare Litu∣ania. Places of their abode They are cald Vri of Oron, that is the Mountaines, because their sauage wildnes is so great, that they sildome discend from those sauegardes. They far excell Buls, and other wild Oxen, comming neerer to the quantity or stature of Elephants, then to the Bull. In resemblance a man would thinke them to be compounded of a Mule and a Hart, for their outward resemblance so seem. It is said they could neuer be tamed by men, although they were taken when they were young, yet they loue other heardes of cattel, and will not for∣sake them easily after they haue once ioyned themselues vnto them, wherby many times they are deceiued and killed, 20. 30. or forty at a time. Caligula Caesar brought of these a∣liue to Rome, and did shew them in publike spectacle to the people, and at that time they were taken for wilde Buls. Some affirme that there are of these in Prussia, and that they are so wild, Countries of their breed cruel, and vntamable, as they feare or spare neither man nor beast; and when they are set vpon and wounded by the hunters in the woods among the trees, feeling their hurts and perceiuing their bloude issuing out of their body, they rage aboue measure, for ha∣uing no meanes to take reuenge vpon the hunter, by reason that he standeth behind some great tree, for very wrath and fury they kill themselues with their owne headlong force vpon the same tree. It is said that their foreheades are so broad and large, that two men may easily sit betwixt their hornes. They are able to take vp an Armed man and his horse, and to tosse him into the aire like a Bull, and the heads of these or such like beasts are to be seene publiquely fixed vp in common places at Mentz and Wormes, which are worth the obseruation, because in all proportion they are twice so big as the vulgar Bull or Oxe. Now although their large bodies and manes doe also appertaine to the Bisons, yet it is not vnfit to attribute the same also to the Vre-Oxe. For if it be in the pleasure of any man to make it also a kind of Bison, I will not deny that this must be remembred, that both the body of this beast is much larger, and also the aspect not so grim or fierce as is the Bison. There are many of these found also in Angremannia, and the Confines of Lapponia, Their stature and other Northerne parts of the world, where they are cald by the Illirian terme Zubrones, and these are so high as a tall man can hardly lay his hand vpon the top of their backes, al∣though he straine himselfe very much. And some of them are fifteen cubits in length, of whom beside their admirable strength, their velocity and nimblenesse is also remarkeable, for it is said of them, that when they empty their bellies, they can turn about to take their dung or excrement vpon their horns before it fall to the ground, which they cast vpon the hunters or pursuers, Dogs or men, whereby they blind and burne them. They which accustome or practise to kill and hunt these beasts, are greatly commended and rewarded when they haue killed many of them, whereof they make proofe, by bringing the hornes of them that they haue killed into the common Market place. In ancient time before the inuention of iron weapons, they did take them in those coun∣tries in ditches, and great caues of the earth, wherunto the strongest and most actiue yoūg men did apply themselues, hauing both Dogs and all other needfull instruments to take a∣way the life of this beast; and if it did not happen that hee fastened his hornes into some tree, then was all the labour lost, for they could neuer come neere to touch him, onely when in his speedy swift fury among the woods, he ran his hornes into the body of some Okes or such like, whereby hee was stayed, (for it is not so easie to pull them forth, as to fixe them, because they are rugged, crooked, and stand vpward) then hee was ouertaken and killed by some hunter or other. And if at any time he met with a hunter, it was fa∣tall and deadly to the man, except hee could auoyde the Beast by getting vnto some tree. Sigismundus Baro, that honorable man writeth thus hereof, that in Masonia neare Lituania it is bred, and called Thur, & they are a kind of wilde Oxen, not differing from the vulgar, (except as aforesaid) but in their colour, and a spotted strake or line which goeth al along their backs. And those Vre-oxen are kept as it were in parkes and chases, hauing a peculi∣ar disignment by the King, and the inhabitantes of certaine villages to keepe and watch them. Sometimes when they meet with a common or vulgar tame Cow, they leape vpon her and fill her, but such a Calfe liueth not long, but dyeth as if it were not perfect, and if it do chance to liue, it neuer resembleth the sire, nor yet is admitted into their society and heard, but are refused for bastards and ignoble breed. And when he was Ambassador to Sigismundus the Empe. he receiued for a gift one of these killed, and bowelled, Vse of their parts. hauing the skin of the forehead cut off and taken away, whereat hee wondered much, but durst not aske the question or reason thereof; yet afterward he vnderstood that there were girdles made of that part of the hide, whereby the women in that Country were perswaded that they should be made apt to conceiue & bring forth children: & Bona the mother of Sigis∣mund gaue vnto him 2. girdles for that purpose, wherof he said he bestowed one vpon the Queene of Romaines, who did take the same at his hand very gratiously and thankefully. And it is certain, that out of the hides of these beasts are made girdles, which are two fin∣gers thicke, and strong, and yet the haire vpon them is soft and gentle like any wooll. The flesh of these beasts is ranke and heauy, and if it be eaten fresh it causeth loosenesse, but if be salted a day or two it it is nothing inferiour to Beefe, for so the humidity is taken away. With the hornes are made drinking Cups, and for that purpose the richer sort of people do edge or lip them ouer with siluer and gold: they hold or containe as much as two ordinary pitchers of water. Other take off the points and fasten them to speares, being very sharp, and not easily blunted or broken, and other make of them cut into slices or panes the best Lanthornes in the world. And thus much for the Vre-Oxe, vnto whose Historie it is needefull for me to adde the story of diuers other wilde Oxen not yet descri∣bed. Strabo saith, that there are Oxen cald Rhizes, among the Hesperian Aethiopians, who in outward proportion are much like the vulgar buls, but in other parts, as quantity, strength, Histories of other wilde Oxen. and vigour, comparable to the Elephants. Theuetus writeth, that betwixt Floridia and Palma, in the new found Worlde, there are verye many strange shaped Beastes, and amonge other a kynde of Wilde Bull, whose hornes are a foot long, but on his backe he hath a tumour or bunch like a Camel, and is therefore called Bos Camelita, his haire all ouer his body is very long, but especial∣ly vnder his chin, and his colour like a yellow Mule, and this beast is a continuall enemy to a Horse. Like vnto these are the tame Scythian Oxen, and some other in Asia, who car∣ry packes vpon the bunches of their backes, and also bend their knees like Camels. OF THE LYBIAN OXE. T Here is so great an innumerability of Libian Oxen, of so great swiftnes and celerity, that the hunters are many times deceiued in hunting them, and so doe certainely chance or fall vpon other wilde beastes for the same they raised, and he in the meane while doth hide himselfe in a place of bram∣bles and briars, keeping himselfe there safe, while other wild beasts doth appeare like vnto them, and so doe deceiue the eies of the hunters: therefore if any man doth begin to fol∣low after either of them, it will be but labour lost, for hee is not able to comprehend or attaine them with a horse, ex∣cept he may take them being wearied by longitude of time. But if any hunters shall find a young calfe, spare the life thereof, and shall not presently kill it, he shall reape a double profit by it: and first it doth bring profit to it selfe, and dooth induce or lead his dam into captiuity. For after that the hunter hath bound the calfe with a rope, she being enflamed by the loue or affection which she beareth to hir calfe, returneth backe againe vnto it, co∣ueting with an ardent desire to loosen and take away her Calfe out of the bond or halter, therefore she thrusteth in hir horne that she may loosen the cord, and pluck hir young one away, whereby she is kept fast bound with hir Calfe, her hornes being entangled in the rope. . Then commeth the hunter and killeth her, and taketh forth her liuer, and also cutteth off her dugs or vdder, and doth likewise pluck off hir skin, & leaueth her flesh for the Birds and wild beasts to feed vpon. There is another kind of Oxe in Libia, whose Hornes doth bend downeward, and for that cause they are faine to feed going backwards. Of the say∣ings of Herodotus and Aelianus, I haue spoken before. Philes doth write that they are cald Oxen going backward, because the broadnes of their hornes doth couer their eie-sight, so that it standeth them in no vse to go forward, but is very commodious to go backward. There is an Oxe which liueth in the woods of Affrick, which doth resemble a domesticall Oxe, yet lesse in stature, of a browne or russet colour, and also most swift of foote. This beast is found in the desarts, African or in the Marches or limits of the desarts. Their flesh is also of a perfect or absolute sauour and tast, good for the nourishment of men. OF THE INDIAN WILD OXEN. T He horns of the Oxen of the Garamantons do grow downewards to∣ward the earth, and therefore when they feede they bow the hinder part of the necke, (as Solinus writeth) and as we haue spoken before in the diuersities of wilde Oxen. The woods also in India are filled with wild Oxen. In the prouince of India where the Gymnits inhabit, are great multitudes of Oxen which liue in the forrests or woods. In the kingdomes which are vpon the borders or Confins of India, onet. (in the mid of the day) are many faire and great Oxen which liue in the woods. There are Mountains in the in most regions of India, which are very hard to come vnto, where they say liue those beasts wilde, which are among vs domesticall and tame, as sheepe, lianus Goates, Oxen, and so forth. The great King of India doth elect or choose a day euery yeare for the runnings and combats of men, and also fightings of beastes, who set∣ting their hornes one against another, do fight irefully with admirable rage, vntill they o∣uercome their aduersaries. They do also labour, and striue withall their nerues and sin∣newes, euen as if they were champions, or fought for some great reward, or should get honor by their battell. Wilde bulles, tame Rams, Asses with one horne, Hyaenaes, and lastly Elephantes, as if they were capable of reason, they wound them among themselues, and the one doth of∣tentimes ouercome and kill the other, and sometimes fall downe togither being both wounded. I haue also recited before in another place of the intreaty of Oxen, those Indi∣an Oxen which are said to be most swift in their ioynts in running too and fro, when they are at combate, because there we had not distinguished whether these were wild Oxen or not: but it doth appeare in this place, that they are wholy taken for wilde Oxen: and the thing it selfe doth manifest that domesticall Oxen are not so swift nor so strong. The Oxen in India haue altogether whole hoofes, and also but one horne. Aethiopia al∣so doth breede Indian Oxen, that is to say, Oxen that are like to those of India, Plinius. for some haue but one horn, & othersome 3. Solinus saith, that there are found in India some Oxen which haue but one horn, & othersome which haue 3. horns with whole hoofs, & not clo∣uen. The Indian Oxen are said to bee as high as a Cammell, and their horne foure foote broad. Ptolomaeus doth report, that he saw a horne of an Indian Oxe which did hold in the bredth of it thirty gallons. There are also Oxen which are bred in India, which in greatnes are no bigger then a Bucke, or Goat, they do run yoaked together very swift, nor do end their race with lesse speed then the Goat-land horses, and I did not take them to be Oxen liuing in the woods, for our Rangifer and Oxen which liue in the woods, are the swiftest of al beasts in this kind, Aristotle and most apt to combats and runnings, and they may partly be called Oxen hauing one horne, and partly Oxen hauing three hornes, neither are they found in Scandinauia, but also in other Regions and Dominions of Asia, as we beleeue that Indian Oxen are of the same kind. Solinus doth not rightly cal those Indian Oxen, which Aelianus calleth Aethio∣picos, as I haue declared aboue in the storie of the Aethiopian Oxen, for their hornes are moouable. Ctesias doth write, that there are sprung vp among the same beasts, that beast which is called Mantichora : which is manifested by Aristotle in his Historie of Foure-foo∣ted beasts. Hermolaus also and others haue not considered this error. Among the Aracho∣tans there are Oxen which liue in the woodes, which do differ from those that are bred in the Citty, as much as wilde swine from tame. Their colour is blacke, bending a litle down∣wards, and their hornes broad and vpright. There is a Citty in India called Arachotus, ta∣king the name from the riuer Arachotus, which do flow out of Causacus, what those beasts are which bend their hornes vpward, I haue declared in the story of the Bison, for as there may be spoken something concerning the difference of the plantes of the woods, so also concerning the beasts that are bred in the Citty, and those that are bred in the woods. OF THE WEASELL. T Here are diuers kinds of VVeasels, but in this place we do intreat of the least kind whose forme and shape we haue also here set downe. It is likwise proper∣ly named of the Latines Mustela, a weasel, for so we were wont plainly to name those which wer common and domesticall and to adde names to those which are more seldome seene, or liue in the woods for difference sake. The word Choled in Leuit. 11. is translated a Weasel of all interpreters. The Rabbins do call them Chuldah, and commonly Mustela, as Dauid Kimhi writeth. The Chaldaeans do translate it Chulda, the Arabians Caldah, the Persians Gurba, and Hieron Mustela. Oach is an Haebrew word, whereupon it was once translated Ochim, plurally in Esay. 13. Babilon subuertetur, & implebunt domes eorum ochim, Munsterus cercopithecos vertit. That is to say, Babilon shall be ouerthrowne, and their houses shall be filled with Ochim, that is, Weasels, but Munsterus doth call them Munkeys. Dauid Kimhi, and the Maister of Thalmud, do call it Nemiah, that is, like to a Cat, but commonly they call it a Martin, or Firum, and Furon. The Authors of the Concordances of the Haebrewes doth interpret Koph, Circopithecum, or Cephum, and Culdah, that is to say Mustela ; a Weasill, as the Iewes do thinke. The Chal∣dae hath translated a Martin Ochijn. Symmachus also hath left or forsaken the Haebru word. Aquila doth translate it Typhones, that is, a Whirle-winde, Hieronimus doeth translate it Draco, that is; a Dragon. Koah is truely interpreted to be a kind of Lizard, or a Chamalion. In Leuiticus 11. We also read in Albertus, His, and Hyrzus, (two Barbarous words) for a Weasell, which hee himselfe doth not vnderstand: but I haue discerned or taken this signification out of the words of Aristotle: for Albertus doth most vnlearnedly expound Hyrcum a Hare, being de∣ceiued, because both the liuing beasts do oftentimes remoue their young ones from one place to another in their mouths. Fethis also doth seeme to be according to Aristotle, no other thing then Gale, that is to say; a Weasell. For Feyton (saith he) it hath wit like a Fox, that is to say, in setting vpon Hens or Chickins, and the other shape and forme of it is Katiz, that is to say Ictis, a Ferret. Nim fitza also is euen to this day called a Weasell a∣mong the Graecians. Ibanauge is also called a Weasell, Ibinuers is a little foure-footed-beast. Si gaticus Bellula also doth seeme to signifie a Weasell, by a feigned worde proceeding from the French or Italians, which do call also Belettam, Balottam pro mustela for a Weasell, but some of the later Graecians do abuse it in tearming it a Catte, as I haue spoken before in the History of the Cat. Theodorus Gaza in Aristotle doeth interpret it sometimes a Weasell, and other some∣times a Cat; neither can I sufficiently gather wherefore he doth so change it, seeing that that the Graecians call Cattum, for a Cat Aeluron, and the Latines Felem. Some say, that Mustela for a Weasell hath bin interpreted or declared of late daies, being onely led (if I be not deceiued) with the affinity of the German word, for the Germans do call Mustela a Wisel. The Graecians do vsually take to this day Mustela for a Weasell, as I haue read in the Oration of Suidas. Scopa A Weasell is called in Italy Donnola, or Ballottula. It is apparant by the words of Auicen that Donnula, and otherwise Dannula is Barbarously vsed Pro mu∣stela for a Weasell: Albertus and Niphus doe write Damula for a Weasell, by the which word the later writers do very obscurely vnderstand Dama for a VVeasell, which is of the kind of Goats liuing in the woods. Damma or Dammula, is a small and weake beast, (as I∣sidorus writeth) speaking of those that are wilde and will not come to hand. VVhen it doth bring forth young, it doth presently deuoure the seconds or those that come after byrth before they touch the earth, Albertus and yet it is a prey it selfe to other Foure-footed-beastes. You may also seeme to take a little Deare, or a kinde of young Goate, or a VVeasell, for that kind of Beast which doth deuour her seconds: But we read that neither of these do it. The Lizard is sayed to deuoure her first litter which she littereth in her old age. VVo also call Domesticall VVeasels Foinos. A weasell is called in France, Belotte or Belette, and Albalotte. Some as I do heare which do inhabite about the townes of Meta, do call them Baccal. Carolus Figuli doth interpret a weasel in French Fouinum, or Marturellum, of which I haue shewed before that there is two kindes, and also that there is weasels liuing in the woods. In Spaine also they are called Comadreia. The people of Rhetia which speake La∣tine, do keepe the Latine name. The Germans do cal them Wisel or Wisele. Georgius Agri∣cola saith, that it is called a weasell by reason of the noise that it maketh. Other some dwel∣ling in Heluetia do call it Hermelin, and some doe call it by a corrupt worde Ha lin, but those ought only to be named so which are altogether white, and are found in winter time. But heere in England it is called a Weasell, and some do write it Wesyll, or Weasyll: but the white weasell is called Mineuer, by the transposition of the letters of the French word, it is called Herminne, and among the Illyrians Kolczauna. Some doe thinke at this day that the beast whose shape and forme we haue giuen for a Weasell, is the Shrew-mouse, but not rightly, for their onely reason is, that the bitings of it doth poyson and harme almost in like manner. Albertus also doth write, that the Sea Weasell is called the fielde-Shrew, which is vtterly false and vntrue: For the Shrevv is called among the Graecians Mygale, Male or Female. They doe now also commonly call Ichnumon the Indian Mouse, and othersome the fallow Deere; But Damula, or Do∣nula, is of the Italians and some later Barborous Writers, altogether called a common Weasell, and not Ichneumon, which is a peculiar Beast to the Egyptians. Now the reason of the Latine name Mustela, Carolus Figulus is of opinion, Niphus The etymo∣logy of Wea¦sels. that it is de∣riued of Mys and Stelio, two Greeke wordes, because it deuoureth Mice, and both the Germans and the English deriue their word Steale, or Stellen, to rob or filtch, from the Greeke worde S ellein ; so that it is so called, because this Weasell is a still, and secret, stealing, and deuouring Beast. Calepin saith, that Mustela is Quasi longior mus. This Beast is also called by Aristotle Habeninum, and it is sayd that it hunteth Moles or blinde Mice. The epithets hereof are, fearefull, In-creeper, and swift, The epithits colour and seueral parts and beside these I finde not any materiall or worthy to be rehearsed. Now concerning their outward proportion, it is as we haue heere described, a long and thinne body, but the colour thereof varieth, for some of them are browne and branded, some blacke, and some cleane white, which we haue shewed already to be the Ermyn : for in some places of Germany, Heluetia, and the Alpes, the Weasels in the Winter become all white. But for as much as there are two kinds of Weasels, one vulgar and domesticall, liuing in Houses and Citties, and the other wild liuing in the Woods & Mountains: we find also that they differ in colour, nei∣ther of both being constant in the same, for the domesticall Weasell is vpon the backe and side sandy, red, and sometime yellowish, and alwaies white on the throat, yea, some∣times as Geor. Agricola writeth, they are all white, whereat no man ought to wonder, see∣ing the Hares of Heluetia do in the Winter time turne white, and of these white Weasels, or Armins there are aboundance in the Northern partes of Europe, where their Sum∣mers are short, and their Winters long: and these white Weasels differ nothing from the common vulgar Weaselles of other colours, except that their haire sticke faster to their backes; and it is obserued, that in Russhia the Noblest Women are apparailed with these skinnes: And there is a VVoode in Scandinauia (called Lanzerucca ) which is fourescore Mile long, wherein are aboundance of white VVeasels, and the Kings tentes among the Tartareans are said to be couered all ouer with the skinnes of Lyons without, and the wals to be hung with these Armins or white VVeasels within; and although the price of these skinnes be very deere among them (for sometimes so many as are vsed in one Garment will cost two thousand Crowns) yet do the people earnestly seeke after them, accounting it no small honor, to weare so much wealth vpon their backes. Now the reason why these beasts came to be called Armilini, is from Armilla a chaine, because they did weare them in fringes about their Garments like chaines; and although that some of the Alpine Mice bee all white, and likewise the Pontique Mouse, yet there must be a difference obserued betvvixt these VVeasels which are properly called Armins and those Mice which are so called, onely by way of resemblance, as we haue shevved al∣ready in their stories. And of the Pontique Mouse, I may adde thus much more, that they liue in the winter time in hollow trees, wherein they become as white as Snow all o∣ouer, except their tailes, and are in quantity like Squirrels, but in the end of May they turn somewhat red, because that then they giue themselues to copulation and generation of young ones, when they lay aside their whitenesse, and liue many dayes together in carnall copulation, among the greene and fresh Hearbs, leauing behinde them such rancke and vnsauory smels, as are very odious to a good scent: And it is said that euery three yeare their skins through aboundance of foode grow greater and greater, to the exceeding com∣modity of Marchants and skinners in Norway, and Helsyngia. There are certaine little Foure-footed-beastes called Lemmar, or Lemmus, Of the Lem∣mars. which in tampestuous and rainy weather, do seeme to fall downe from the cloudes, and it was ne∣uer yet found, whether their beginning arose first from heauen or earth, but this is cer∣taine that assoone as euer they haue fallen to the ground, some of them haue bin opened, and in their bowels haue bin found greene hearbes, and therefore I maruaile why euer it should be beleeued that these beasts are bred of some seculent matter in the cloudes; but if any man aske me from whence then haue they their beginning, I answer from the earth, euen as Locusts and Catterpillers, who are said in holy scripture to be carryed to and fro with the winds, and so these beasts being destitute of naturall food in their places of gene∣ration, do aduance themselues into the wind, and so are carried into other strange and vn∣knowne countries, where they fall like Locusts vpon euery greene thing, liuing vntill they haue deuoured all, but when once they tast of new grown Hearbs, they perish and dy, by meanes whereof they encrease great pestilence and corruption, but the Armlins or Ar∣mins, do eate and deuoure them. Now the skins of these beasts are exceeding delicate hauing in them diuers colours, and therfore the people flea them off from their bodies, and sel them by thirty or forty in bun∣dles for great price, but of these skins I haue sayd enough, both here and else where. The wild weasels differ not from the vulgar domesticall weasell, their foreteeth are short, and not long like a Mouses, the face broad, their genital part like a foxes, their taile short, their legs and clawes short, strong and sharp, and it is reported by Strabo, that the Weasels of Mauritania are as big as Cats, but their gaping and opening of their mouth much longer and wider. There is an Island called Dordocelena, on the one side whereof (as Pliny writeth) there are weasels, and through the middle there is a way ouer which they neuer passe, and on the otherside there are not onely not any bred, but also if they be brought into it they die and perish, and so likewise it is reported of Beotia. They make themselues caues and holes in the earth, rocks, and wals, wherin they lodge, into the which they frame two passages or doores, Places of their abode one into the South, the other into the North (resembling herein the Squyrrels) that so they may be free from the wind on which side so euer it bloweth, sometimes they get into stackes of Hay and straw, and their they lodge: those weasels which liue neare houses sleep not much, for they haue bin seen abroad all the winter time, not only the vulgar but the Armins, neither are they vnthankfull vnto the country men in whose houses they lodge, for they kill, eat, and douour all manner of Mice, Rats, and Molds, for because of their long slender bodies, they are apt to creep in∣to the holes of the earth and narrow passages, fetching their prey from those places, whe∣ther cats cannot come, therefore in Heluetia the country men nourish them more then Cats, because they destroy more virmin then Cats. The harme they do is to Hens, chic∣kins, and Egges, and yet some say they eat the Egges and let the hens alone: they are like∣wise enimies to geese, and deuoure their Egges, and Aelianus writeth, that if they come vnto dead men, they will pull out their eies in such manner as they do Egges, and there∣fore such carkases are to be watched against them. Amyntas writeth, that the Shrew-mouse is conceiued betwixt a mouse and a weasell, which opinion is not only ridiculous but im∣possible, for how is it likely that a mouse will engender with that beast which lyeth in waite to destroy her. It is also said that a weasell fighteth with those serpents that hunt after Mice, for no other cause, but to gaine the prey from him. Their copu∣lation and conception. There is nothing in this beast more strange, then their conception and generation, for they do not engender nor couple in their hinder parts, like other foure-footed-beasts, but at their eares, and bring forth their young ones at their mouth, and for this cause Aristeas writeth, the Iewes were forbidden to eat them, for this their action was an emblem of fol∣ly, and of foolish men, which can keep no secrets but vtter al that they hear (thus saith he) but we that are christians knew other reasons, vvhy the Ievves vvere forbid to eate them. The Egyptians make of it another sign, for they say that their copulation at the eare, and generation at the mouth, are emblems of speech which is first taught to the eare, and then vttered by the tongue: there be other againe that hold this to be a fable: And Pope Cle∣men vvriteth, that they conceiue at the mouth, and bring forth at the eare, many say it is true of the vveasell of the Sea, but not of the Weasell of the earth, vvhich is therefore called Collipara, and this they vvould confirme by another fable of Medusa, vvhose head after it vvas cut off, it is said to bring forth Chrysaor and Pegasus ; some do alledge for this opinion, that the Crovves and the Ibis do conceiue at their mouthes, but this is certaine, that they haue places of conception vnderneath their tails like other Four-footed-beasts, and therefore how it should come to passe, that their young ones should come foorth at their mouths, I cannot easily learne. It may be that the opinion thereof first arose from the sight of some old one carrying her young in her mouth, for the young ones are very small like Mice, and therefore it is likely that they remoue them to and fro as Catres doe their young ones, for they are in continuall feare, least they should be taken and destroied by men, or by some other Enimy beast. The dung of weasels doth smel many times like musk, the reason whereof we haue she∣wed you in another place, al of them in general haue a most ranke and filthy sauour. It is a rauening and destroying beast, and although the body of it be very small, yet is the witte and vnderstanding of it very great, for with singular Art and subtilty it compasseth his prey, wherupon there lyeth this history of Galanthis the maid of Alckmena, as Perottus ob∣serueth out of Ouid. VVhen Alckmena was in long trauell and childe-birth, it is said that the maid perceiuing shee was hindered by Lucina, craftily obtained not onely the know∣ledge of the cause by Lucina, but also the remedy; whereupon she eased her Lady, (like a true and faithful seruant) of many paines. Lucina seeing that he was beguiled by Galanthis, and that her crafty wit had ouer-reached a Goddesse, shee turned her into a VVeasell for her punnishment, that as she had sinned by reuealing the counsel of the Goddesse, so she should be punnished to bring forth al her young ones at hir mouth, as weasels doe; and for this occasion the Domestical weasel like a maide doth continually liue in houses, and her colour yellowish like the haire of Galanthis : thus say they of metamorphosing and transforming. Others some say, that when Alckmena was in trauel of Hercules, hauing indured long tor∣ments, she was deliuered by the sight of a weasel which came in her presence, and there∣fore the Theban Graecians do religiouslie worship a weasel, for they say that as it was norisht by Heccate the Goddesse, so it did norish Hercules ; but heerein they take Gale for Galanthis aforesaid, that is, a weasel; for Alckmenaies maid, and seeing we haue begunne to talke of transformations, I wil adde another thinge out of Stobeus, not impertinent to this com∣mon place, for he writeth in the dispraise of women, that the diuersitie of their dispositi∣ons perswadeth him that some of them are deriued from one beast, and some from ano∣ther: and namely those which come of weasels, are a miserable, sullen, and sorrowful kind of women, to whome nothing is pleasing, delightfull, or acceptable, but hauing no mind to the pleasure of Venus, loathing hir husband, hurteth her neighbors, robbeth her self, and deuoureth consecrated and hallowed things, euen after the manner of weasels, which will take a booty from the altar: Thus saith he, which I beleeue to be true in the compa∣rison, but not in the generation or transmutation of women from weasels. I do maruaile how it came to passe that a weasell was called, an vnhappy, infortunate, and vnlucky beast among Hunters, for they held opinion heere in England, The signifi∣cation of a Weasels oc∣currence. that if they meet with a weasel in the morning, they shal not speed wel that day, therefore the Graeci∣ans say Galesteir, and Altiatus hath an excellent Emblem, whereby hee insinuateth that it is not good to haue a weasel run vppon ones left hande, and therefore aduiseth a man to giue ouer his enterprize, after such an Omen. Now although I would haue no wise man to stand in feare of such a superstitious conceit, yet I wil subscribe his verses, more for vari∣ety and elegancie, then for truth: Auspicijs res coepta malis bene cedere nescit Foelici quae sunt omine fact a iuuant Quicquid ages mustela si, tibi occurret omitte Signa malae haec sortis bestia praua gerit. It should seeme that the beginning of this opinion did come from the punishment of a certain general of the Corinthians nauy, who being periured in breaking his faith to that state, came running awaie from them; and they saie that afterwards he could neuer sleep, but that he dreamed weasels came and tore his flesh from his bodie: At last through an∣guish and grees;e of mind, he flue himself, these things are reported by Heraclides, which whether they be true or false, are but a sillie and slender foundation to build vpon them a Prophetical opinion, or presage future euils, and so I wil leaue the morral part of the wea∣sel, and returne againe to the natural. They haue knowledge like mice and rattes, to run out of houses before their downefal. They liue in hatred with the serpent that hunteth mice, for by eating of Rue they driue them out of houses, wherein they inhabite; and this is a wonderful worke of God, that this silly beast should haue the knowledge of the virtue of that hearbe, and not onely arme her selfe with it, because it is hateful to Serpents, and they in no wise in nature able to abide it, but also by it to restore to life againe her younge ones after they are dead. There is a poison in Weasels which destroyeth the Cockatrice, for when the VVeasel findeth the Cockatrices hole or den, she layeth her poison in the mouth therof, whereby two contrary natures meet and fight, and the lesser ouercommeth the greater, and this is affirmed both by Pliny and Solinus ; wherefore all maner of cattle do feare weasels. They hunt all manner of birds, pulling out theyr throate as a wolfe doeth a sheepes. They will play with Hares till they haue wearied them, and then destroy them, they are in perpetu∣al enmity with swine, Rauens, Crowes, and Cats, for although Cats sometimes set vpon them, yet they cannot ouercome them. In many places of Italy they are nourished tame, for as Ferrets are vsed to fetch Conies out of the earth, so are weasels by tying a stringe a∣bout their necke to fetch young Pigeons out of Doue-cotes, and birds out of their nests. If the pouder of a weasel be giuen vnto a Cocke, Chickens, or pigeons, it is said they shal neuer be annoied by weasils. Likewise if the braine of a weasel, bee mingled with a rennet in cheeses, it keepeth them from being couched with mice or corrupted with age. The flesh of a weasel is not v∣sed for meat, but dried and preserued for medicines. The powder thereof mixed with wa∣ter driueth away mice, by casting the gall of Stellius in a house where VVeasels are gathe∣red togither, and then by oile of bitter Almonds, or salt Ammoniak they are killed, but if one of their tailes be cut off, al the residue do forsake the house. And thus much shall suffice concerning the History of VVeasels, now followeth the medicines arising out of their bodies. The medicines arising from the Weasel. A weasel being applied vnto those which are troubled with Agues or Quarterne Fea∣uers, Vrsinus. doth in short time cure them. It doth also being mingled with other thinges make a wonderful pleasant mollifying medicine for those which are troubled with the gout or any other infirmity in the ioyntes, and easeth those which haue a continual ache in the head, leauing a certaine matter on the top thereof, and stroking it from the foreheade to the hinder part of the head. For the curing also of the gout, this is an excellent remedy. To take a little yong whelp aliue wel fatted, and a liuing weasel in nine pintes of oile, and vnto the same two or three pounds of Butter, A tius and to boile them together, vntil the Beastes be made lanke or lither, and then to put your hands or feet a whole daie in hot oile wel strained. Auicenna attribu∣teth certaine things to weasels flesh only, which the classical Authors rather ascribe to the powder of weasels which are these: to be applyed to the gout, being drunk in wine against the falling sicknesse, and the head-ache, but it is accounted an especiall remedy against the bitings of Scorpions. The flesh of a weasel being taken, is a verie good and effectual preseruatiue againste al poisons. The same being taken in meat, the head and feet onely cast awaie, doeth helpe those which are troubled with VVennes or bunches in the flesh, being first anointed with the blood of the same beast. The blood of a weasel is very wel applied to broken or exulce∣rated sores in the flesh. Auicenna The same vertue hath the whole bodie of a weasel boiled in wine, being in the manner of a plaister placed thereunto. For the expelling of the gout take a dead weasel, and boile him in oyle, vntil it be made liquid, then straine forth the oile, and mingle it with wax, Theophrastus fashioning the same in the forme of a plaister, and this being in good order applyed, wil in very short time expel it quite away. A house weasel is wont to be burned for diuers remedies, and to be imbowelled with salt, and dried in a shade. But there are some late writers which affirme, Dioscorides that a weasell is better being dried or burned for the said disease, then vsed in the aforesaid manner, some also which are more foolish, think it best, being onely salted, but it is more proper, being vsed in the first manner. The bodies of creatures which are dry by nature being dryed by the sprinkling of salt vp∣on them, are vnmeete for foode, for a certaine man going about to salt a Hare, made it like vnto a dryed weasel. Some haue written that the flesh of a Hedge-hog dried, doth ve∣ry much profit those which are troubled with an outward or inwarde leprosie: which if it can effect, it will more strongly haue a drying force or power: euen as the flesh of a wea∣sell being dried and drunke in wine, expelleth poison. A vulgar weasell being kept very old and drunke in VVine, to the quantity of two drams, is accounted a present remedy a∣gainst the venome or stings of serpents. A young weasel being prepared, as is before said, that is to say imbowelled with salte, Gallen. is of good force against all il medicines. A weasel vsed in the same maner doth presentlie cure the bites of serpenst. A weasel being brent and dryed, especially the belly thereof is accounted an excellent remedy against the bitings of any other wilde beast. Some small part of the belly of a young weasel to the quantity of two drams being stuffed with Cori∣ander, and drunke in wine, is giuen to those that are smitten by serpentes, and is curable for them. The flesh of a weasel being burnt, mingled with rue and wine, and so drunke, is very medicinable for the curing of the bites of al creatures. Pl The young whelps of weasels being imbowelled with salt, is very profitable for the healing of the deadly stinging or bi∣ting of the spider called Phalaugium. The whelp of a weasel doth cure the venomous bitings of the shrew. Albertus The flesh of a wea¦sel being dried, doth strongly dry and seperat, by both which forces those are heald which are troubled with the falling sicknes hauing drunk it in wine. This vertue is also attributed vnto the blood of weasels. A weasel being dried and drunke in wine, doth heale those that are troubled with the palsie or shaking of the ioynts. Concerning the pouder of weaselles there are many things read: But Galen writeth, that he neuer burned this creature, that he might try the excellency thereof. The blood and pouder of a weasel are very profitable, being anointed on those whose bodies are vext with the leprosie, acording to the saying of Serenus in these verses: — Elephanti Morbo aduersus erit cedri de cortice succus, Mustelaeue cinis vel fusus sanguis ab illa. The pouder of a weasel, being mingled with the blood of a young swallow doth heale the Quinsie or Squincy, the inflammation of the iawes, as also those which are greeued vvith the strangurie, being either taken in bread or in drinke. The same is also very effectual for the expelling of wens or bunches in the body, and healeth those which are troubled with the falling sicknesse, being daily taken in drinke. The same diseases are both healed by this medicin, to burn a liuing weasel altogether in an earthen pot, Myrepsus and to mingle with the pou∣der thereof Hony, Turpentine, and Butter, of each a sufficient quantity, and in the maner of an ointment, to apply it vnto the bodies of the grieued parties. The blood of a swallow and a weasel are commended by some to be very congruent and agreeable, but Pliny, A∣uicenna, and the rest of the auncient writers commend the blood of a weasel onely to bee very medicinable for these diseases following; namely, the falling sicknes, the Foule-euil, Serenus and the head-ach. The pouder of a weasel being mingled in water, and giuen to one that is madde or fren∣zy to drinke, is reported by some to be very good and profitable for him, if so be that they can compel the Franticke person to perceiue it. The pouder of a weasel is very effectual for the expelling or taking away of the pin and web in the eies. Plinie. There is a speedy remedy for the driuing away of rheume in the head, and the catar swelling by rheume in the iaws, which is this, to take a weasel vpon a Thursday in the old moone, and put him aliue in an vnburned pot, that in the boiling he may be torne, and dried into pouder, which pouder being gathred togither and wel tempred with hony, to giue it to the diseased person eue∣ry day in a spoone fasting, to the quantity of three drams, and it wil in short space wonder∣fully ease him. A Weasell being brent, and the powder thereof wrapped in some seare-cloath which is annointed ouer with the oile of Flower-de luces, doth helpe and heale al sores or im∣postumes proceeding from the head to the eares being applyed thereunto. A Weasell being beaten to powder, mingled with wax, and in the manner of a seare-cloath applied vnto the shoulders, doth expell al paines, aches, or greefes therein whatsoeuer; it doth also purge or clense sores very effectually, according to these verses of Serenus following: Obscaenos si pone locos noua vnlner a carpant, Horrentum mansa curantur fronde ruborum. Et si iam veteri succedit fistula morbo, Mustelae cinere immisso purgabitur vlcus, Sanguine cum recini, quem bos gestauerit anti. A Weasell being burned in an earthen pot, is verie medicinable for the curing of the gout. The pouder thereof being mingled with Vineger, and in that manner thereunto a∣plied. Dioscorides The dust of a liuing Weasell brent, mingled with wax and rose-water, and annoin∣ted with a Feather vpon gouty legs, cureth the same disease. The braine of a Weasel being kept very long, and thorougly dried, afterwards mingled with vineger, and so drunke, doth very effectually cure the falling sicknes. Rasis. The braines of a Cammell mingled with the braines of a weasel being both well dryed, and drunke in Vineger, speedily helpeth those which are troubled with the disease called the Foule-euill. If a horse shal fal into a sudden disease (being for the most part tearmed daungerous,) which our Countrey-men cal Raech, concerning which, I haue spoken in the Horse, he is cured by some Horse-coursers by a small quantity of a Weasels skinne, (being about the bignesse of a foresaide golden crowne) which is giuen to him inwardly, whether in a potion by some horne, or cut small and mingled with chaffe, I knowe not. Some doe giue to the horses troubled with the aforesaide disease the taile of a white wea∣sell being halfe blacke, and halfe white, cut exceeding smal in their chaffe or prouender. If a serpent or any other venomous creature shal stinge or bite an Oxe, let the wounded place be stroked or smoothed with the skin of a weasel, & it shal in short time be perfectly cured. The same they do in a maner commannd to be done to horses which are so stunge or bitten, rubbing the wound which the Weasels skin vntill it wax hot, ministring in the meane time some certaine Antidote within the horses body. There are some also which are of opinion that the skin being in the saide manner applyed, is of no efficacy, but that the whole beast being cut & aplyed while it is hot, wil rather profit, which both in a shrew, as also in many other creatures is manifest. The bloode of a Weasel being annointed vppon any impostume arising behinde the eare, A higines doth instantly cause the swelling to cease, or being broken, doth speedily heale the sore. The same also being anointed vpon any impostumes in the head either whole or bro∣ken, doth very effectually cure them. The blood of a weasell being anointed vpon wen or bunches of flesh in any part of the body doth instantly expel them. The same doth also helpe those which are troubled vvith the falling sicknesse: which disease is also cured by the whole body of a Weasel either brent or imbowelled with salte. The heade and feete of a Weasel being castaway, and the body taken in any kind of drink doth perfectly heal those which are troubled with that pestiferous disease called S. Iohns euil. The bloode of the same beast, is an excellent remedy for the expelling of the Fowle-euil. The blood of a weasel being annointed vpon broken or exulcerated bunches in the flesh, doth not only mittigate the paine but also heale the wounds. The blood of a weasel being anointed vp∣pon the iawes, doth heale all paines or sores therein whatsoeuer. The pouder and blood of a weasel being both mingled together and anointed vpon the body of any leprous man doth in short time driue away al scabs or scurffes thereon. The blood of a weasel being a∣nointed with a plantaine vpon the legs or feet of any one that is troubled with the gout, doth very speedily mittigate or asswage the paine thereof. The same being annointed vp∣pon the nerues or sinnewes which are shrunke togither, doth easily mollifie them againe, and loosen the greeuous paine eyther in the ioynts or articles. The liuer of a weasel min∣gled with his own braines, being both well dryed, and taken in any kind of drinke, doth ve∣ry much profit those which are troubled with the disease called S. Iohns euill. The liuer of a weasell being throughly dryed, and afterwardes taken in water to drinke, doth heale the disease called the foule euill, taking hold of sence & mind together: but there must great care be had that this medicine be ministred vnto the sicke party, euen when the disease is comming on him. The gal of a hare being mingled with the liuer of a weasel to the quan∣tity of three drams, one dram of oyle of Beauers stones, foure drams of Myrrhe, Galen with one dram of vineger, and drunk in hony, or bastard wine, doth heale those which are troubled with a dizzinesse or certaine swimming in the head. The liuer of a weasell is reported to be very good and medicinable for the curing of the lethargy, or dropsie euill. Sextus The liuer of a weasel being bound to the left foot of a woman, doth altogether hinder her from conception The gall of a weasell is a very excellent and effectuall remedy against the venom or poyson of aspes, being taken in any kind of drink. The yard of a weasell, Hart, or Doe, being dryed, beaten to powder, and taken in wine, or any other drink, is an excellent me∣dicine for the curing of the bites or stings of serpents. The yard of a weasell or Ferret, is commended for a very excellent remedy against the strangury, or disease called the col∣like and stone. The stones of a male weasell, or the secret parts of a female weasel, Pliny is repor∣ted by some to be very medicinable for the curing of the falling sicknesse. The stones of a weasell being bound vnto any part of e woman while she is in trauaile of child birth, doth altogether hinder her from her deliuery. By the left stone of a Weasell being bound in a piece of a mules hid, there is a certaine medicine made, which being drunke by any Wo∣man not being with child, causeth barrennesse, as also by Women being with child hard and grieuous paine in deliuery. The efficacy or force in them, haue the stones of a Wea∣sel being cut off in the change of the Moone, and he suffered to go away aliue, Kiranides. being tyed vpon any part of a woman in the hide of a Mule. The heele of a liuing weasell being taken away and bound vnto a woman, doth make her that she shall not conceiue so long as shee shall so beare it. The powder of a dogs head dryed, being put into any broken or exulce∣rated sores, doth eat away al the corruption or dead flesh encreasing therein. The same vertue hath the powder of weasels dung, being vsed in the said manner. The dung of Mice or of a weasell, being annointed vpon the head, is an excellent reme∣dy for the falling off of the haire on the head, or any other part of mans body, Aegi tta and doth also cure the disease called by some the Foxes euill. The biting of a weasell is reported by some to be very venomous, and in his rauening or madnesse, not to be lesse hurtfull then the bitings of mad dogs. For weasels and Foxes are very often mad. But Arnoldus is of a contrary opinion, and affirmeth that the weasell doth more hurt by his biting, Auice then by any venom he can put forth. Others also doe affirme, that there is venom in weasels, for this cause, that in all kind of Weasels when they are angry, the force of their smell is so ranke and strong. The best way to driue away Mice, is by scattering the powder of weasels or cats dung vp and downe, the sauour whereof Mice canot abide, but the same being made into some certaine kind of bread will smell more strongly. That the bites of a weasell are venomous and deadly, there is an example writen by Aristides, of a certaine man, who being bitten by a weasell, and ready to die, gaue a great sigh, and said that if he had dyed by a Lyon or Panther, it would neuer haue grieued him, but to dye by the biting of such an ignoble beast, it grieued him worse then his death. The biting of a weasell, Aelianus doth bring very quicke and grieuous paine, which is onely knowne by the colour, being dusky or ble∣wish: and it is cured by onions and garlike, either applyed outward or taken in drinke, so that the party drinke sweet wine thereon. Vnripe figs also mingled with the flower of the graine called Orobos, doth much profit the same. Treacle in like manner, being applyed in the manner of a plaister, speedily cureth them. Garlike being mingled with fig tree leaues and cynamon, and so beaten together, are very wel applyed to the saide bites. It com∣meth also to passe, that sometimes the weasel biteth some cattel, which presently killeth them, except ther be some instant remedy. The remedy for it is this, to rubbe the woun∣ded place with a piece of a weasels skin wel dryed vntil it waxe hot, and in the meane time giue the beast Treacle to drinke in the manner of an antidote. The Weasel vsually biteth cowes dugs, which when they are swollen if they be rubd with a VVesels skin they are in∣stantly healed. OF THE WOLFE. A Wolfe is cal¦led in Hebru Zeeb, The seueral names. as it is saide in Gen. 49. and a∣mong the Chalde¦ans Deeba, & Deba among the Arabi∣ans Dib. A s ulapius. The fem∣ale is called Zebah a she wolfe, & the masculin Zeebim, but in Ezek. 22. it is cald zebeth, that is to say, a wolfe. Alsebha (saith And. Bellun. ) is a common name for al Fourfooted-beasts, which do set on men, killing and tearing them in pieces, deuouring them with their teeth and clawes, as a Lyon, a wolfe, a Tiger, and such like, wheron they are said to haue the be∣hauiour of Alsebhaie, that is wilde beasts which are fierce and cruel. From hence happily commeth it, that not onely Albertus, but also some ignorant writers doe attribute vnto a wolfe many things which Aristotle hath vttered concerning a Lyon. Oppianus among the other kind of wolues hath demonstrated one which is bred in Cilicia. And also he doth write that it is called in the mountaines of Taurus and Amanus, Chryseon, that is to say, Aureum, but I coniecture that in those places it was cald after the language of the Haebrews or Sirians, which do cal Sahab, or Schab aurum, and Seeb lupum for a wolf, or Dahab, or Debah, for Aurum : They also do cal Deeb or Deeba for a wolf. Dib (otherwise Dijs ) is an Arabian or Saracenican word: Also the translation of this worde in the booke of medicines is diuers, as Adib, Adip, Adhip, and Aldip : but I haue preferred the last tran∣slation, which also Bellunensis doth vse. Aldip alambat doth signifie a mad or furious wolfe. The wolfe which Oppianus doth cal Aureum, as I haue said euen now, doth seem to agree to this kinde, both by signification of the name Aurum, and also by the nature because it doth go vnder a dog close to the earth to eschew the heat of the summer, which Oppianus doth write, doth seeke his foode out of hollowe places, as a Hyaena or Dabha doth out of graues where the deade men are buried. The golden coloured wolfe is also more rough & hairy then the residue, euen as the Hyaena is said to be rough and maned. And also these wolues necks in India is maned, but it differeth according to the nation and colour where there are any wolues at al. Lycos a wolfe among the Graecians, and Lugos, and Lucainia, and Lycos, among some of the Arabican writers is borrowed from them, as Munster hath noted in his lexicon of 3. languages. In Italy it is called Lupo. In French Loup, in Spaine Lobo, in Germany Vulff, in England Wolfe. In Illyria Vulk, as it were by a transposition of the letters of the greek word Now because both men, women, citties, places, mountains, villages, and many artificiall instruments haue their names from the Latine and Greek words of this beast, The notatiō of Lupus and Lyons. it is not vain or idle to touch both them and the deriuation of them, before we proceed to the natural storie of this beast. Lupus as some say in Latine is Quasi leopos, Lyon-footed; because that it resembleth a Lyon in his feet, and therefore Isidorus writeth, that nothing liueth that it presseth or treadeth vpon in wrath. Other deriue it from lukes the light, because in the twi∣light of the euening or morning it deuoureth his prey, auoiding both extreame light as the noone day, Named apel∣latiues deri∣ue om a wolfe. and also extreame darknesse as the night. The Graecians do also cal them Nycterinoi kanes, dogs of the night. Lupa and lupula were the names of noble deuouringe Harlots, and from thence commeth Lupanar for the stewes. It is doubtful whether the nurse of Romulus and Remus were a harlot or she Wolf, I rather thinke it was a harlot then a Wolfe that cursed those children. For we read of the wise of Fostulus, which was called Laurentia, after she had plaied the vvhore vvith certaine shepheards, to be called Lupa. In al Nations there are some mens names deriued from wolues, therfore vve read of Lu∣pus a roman poet, Lupus Seruatus a priest or Elder, of Lupus de oliueto a Spanish Munke, of Fulvius lupinus a Roman, and the Germans haue Vulf, Vulfe, Hart, Vulfegang. The Graecians haue Lycambes, of whom it is reported he had a Daughter called Neobole, which he promised in marriage to Archilochus the Poet, yet afterwardes he repented and woulde not performe his promise, for which cause the Poet wrote against him many bit∣ter verses, and therefore Lycambes when he came to knowledge of them, dyed for griefe. Lycaon was a common name among the Graecians for many men, as Lycaon Gnotius, an ex∣cellent maker of edged tooles. Licaon the brother of Nestor, another the son of Priamus slaine by Achilles, but the famous and notorious among all was Lycaon, the king of Arca∣dia, the son of Titan and the earth, whose Daughter Calisto was deflowered by Iupiter, and by Iuno turned into a beare, whom afterwards Iupiter pittying, placed for a sign in heauen, and of whom Virgil made this verse; Pleiadas, Hyadas, claram{que} Lycaonis arcton. Ther was another Lycaon the son of Pelasgus, which built the Citty Lycosura, in the Moun∣taine Lycaeus, this man called Iupiter Lycaeus. On a time he sacrificed an infant vpon his al∣tar, after which sacrifice he was presently turned into a wolfe. Ther was another Lycaon after him, who did likewise sacrifice another child, and it was said that he remained ten years a wolfe, & afterwards becam a man again, wherof the reason was giuen, that during the time he remained a beast he neuer tasted of mans flesh, but if he had tasted therof he shold haue remained a beast for euer. I might adde hereunto Lychophron, Lycastus, Lycimnius, Lysi∣nus, Lychomedes, Lycurgus, Lycus, and of womens names, Lyca, Lyce, Lycaste, Lycoris, Ly∣cias, and many such others, besides the names of people, as Irpini, of Mountaines & pla∣ces, as Lycabetus, Lyceus, Lycerna, Lycaonia, Lycaspus, Lyceum Aristotles schoole. Of flouds and Riuers, as Lycus, Lycormas. Of plants, as wolfe bane, Lupum salictarium lupinus, Lycan∣theum, Lycophrix, Lycophone, Lycopsis, Lycoscytalion, and many such others, whereof I haue onely desired to giue the Reader a tast, following the same Method that we haue obserued in other beasts: And thus much shall suffice to haue spoken of the names of this beast. Contries breeding wolues. The countries breeding wolues, are for the most part these that follow. The inhabitants of Creet were wont to say, that there was neither wolues, Beares, nor Vipers cold be bred in their Island, because Iupiter was borne there, yet there is in a city called Lycastus, (so na∣med for the multitude of wolues that were abiding therein) It is likewise affirmed of Sar∣dinia, and Olimpus, a Mountaine of Macedonia, that there come no Wolues in them. The wolues of Egypt are lesser then the wolues of Greece, for they exceede not the quantity of Foxes. Affrica likewise breedeth small wolues, they abound in Arabia, in Sweuia, Rhaetia, Athesis, and the earldome of Tirol in Muscouia, especially that part that bordereth vppon Lithuania. The wolues of Scanzia, by reason of extremity of cold in those parts are blind & loose their eies: there are no wolues bred in Lumbardy beyond the Alpes, & if any chance to come into that countrey, presently they ring their bels, and arme themselues against them, neuer giuing ouer till they haue killed him, or droue him out of the countrey. In Norway there are 3. kind of wolues, and in Scandinauia the wolues fight with Elkes. It is re∣ported that ther are wolues in Italy, who when they looke vpon a man, cause him to be si∣lent, that hee cannot speake. The French-men call those Wolues which haue eaten of the flesh of men Eucharnes. Among the Crotoniatae in Meotis, & diuers other parts of the world, wolues do abound: there are some few in France, but none at al in England, except such as are kept in the Tower of London to be seene by the Prince and people brought out of other countries, where there fell out a rare accident, namely, a mastiue dog was limed to ashe wolfe, and she thereby conceiued and brought forth sixe or seuen young Whelpes, which was in the yeare of our Lord 1605. or there abouts. There are diuers kinds of wolues in the world, The seuerall kinds of wolues. whereof Oppianus in his admonition to sheapheards maketh mention of fiue, the first is a swift wolfe, and runneth fast, called there∣fore Toxeuter, that is, Sagitarius a shooter. The second kind are called Harpages, and these are the greatest raueners, to vvhom our sauiour Christ in the gospell compareth false pro∣phets, when he saith, Take heed of false prophets which come vnto you in sheeps clothing, but are inwardly Lycoy harpages, rauening wolues, and these excel in this kind. The third kind is cald Lupus aureus, a golden wolfe, by reason of his colour, then they make mention of two o∣ther kinds, (called Acmonae ) and one of them peculiarly Ictinus. The first vvhich is svvift, hath a greater head then other vvolues, and likewise greater legs fitted to run, white spots on the belly, round members, his colour betwixt red & yellovv, is very bold, howleth fearefully, hauing firy-flaming eies, and continually wagging his head. Oppi us The second kind hath a greater and larger body then this, being swifter then all o∣ther; betimes in the morning he being hungry, goeth abroad to hunt his prey, the sides and taile are of a siluer colour, he inhabiteth the Mountaines, except in the winter time, wherein he defendeth to the gates of Citties or Townes, and boldly without feare killeth both Goates and sheepe, yet by stealth and secretly. The third kind inhabiteth the white Rocks of Taurus and Sylicia, or the tops of the hill, Amanus, and such other sharp and inaccessible places, being worthily for beauty prefer∣red before the others, because of his Golden resplendant haires: and therefore my Au∣thor saith: Non lupus sed lupo praestantior fera. That he is not a wolfe, but some wilde Beast excelling a wolfe. He is exceeding strong, especially being able with his mouth and teeth to bite asunder not only stones, but Brasse and Iron: He feareth the Dog star and heate of summer, reioycing more in cold then in warme weather, therfore in the Dog daies he hideth himselfe in some pit or gaping of the earth, vntill that sunny heat be abated. The fourth and fift kinds are cald by one common name Acmone, now Acmon signifieth an E∣gle, or else an Instrument with a short neck, & it may be that these are so called in resem∣blance of the rauening Eagle, or else because their bodies are like to that instrument, for they haue short necks, broad shoulders, rough Legs and feet, and small snouts, and little eies: herein they differ one kind from the other, because that one of them hath a backe of a siluer colour, and a white belly, and the lower part of the feet blacke, and this is Ictinus??? canus, a gray Kite-wolfe: the other is black, hauing a lesser body, his haire standing continu∣ally vpright, and liueth by hunting of Hares. Now generally al Authors do make some two, some 3. some 4. and some fiue kinds of Wolues, all which is needlesse for me to pro∣secute, and therefore I will content my selfe, with the only naming of such differences as are obserued in them and already expressed, except the Thoes and the sea-wolfe, of whom there shal be somthing said particularly in the end of this History. Olaus Magnus writeth, in his History of the Northerne regions, that in the Mountaines cald Doffrini, which doe deuide the kingdoms of Swetia and Norway, there are great flockes or heardes of wolues of white colour, whereof some wander in the Mountaines, and some in the vallies. They feed vpon little, small, and weake creatures, but there are also wild common wolues, who lie in waite to destroy their heards of cattell, and flocks of sheep, against whom the people of the country do ordaine general huntings, taking more care to destroy the young ones then the old, that so the breeders and hope of continuance may be taken away. And some also do keepe of the whelps aliue, shutting of them vp close and taming them, especially females, who afterwards engender with dogs, whose Whelpes are the most excellent kee∣pers of flocks, and the most enimies to wolues of all other. Wolues are o wilde dogges. There be some haue thought that Dogs and Wolues are one kind; namely, that vulgar Dogs are tame Wolues, and rauening wolues are wilde dogs. But Scaliger hath learned∣ly confuted this opinion, shewing that they are two distinct kinds, not ioyned together in nature, nor in any naturall action, except by constraint; for he saith, that there are diuers wilde dogs are not wolues, and so haue continued for many yeares in a hill cald Mountfal∣con, altogether refusing the society and seruice of men, yea sometimes killing and eating them; and they haue neither the face, nor the voyce, nor the stature, nor the condicions of wolues, for in their greatest extremity of hunger, they neuer set vpon flocks of sheep: so that it is vnreasonable to affirme, that wolues are wilde dogs, although it must needs be confessed, The voyces of wolues. that in outward proportion they are very like vnto them. Some haue thought that wolues cannot bark, but that is false (as Albertus writeth) vpon his owne knowledge, the voice of wolues is called Vulatus howling, according to these verses; Ast lupus ipse vlulat frendet agrestis aper, And againe: Per noctem resonare lupis, vlulantibus vrbes. It should seeme that the word Vlulatus, which the Germans translate Heulen, the French Hurler, and we in English, howling, is deriued either from the imitation of the beasts voice; or from a night whooping Bird called Vlula, I will not contend, but leaue the Reader to either of both, for it may be that it commeth from the Greek word, Ololeuzein, which sig∣nifieth to mourne and howle after a lamentable manner, and so indeed wolues doe neuer howle, but when they are oppressed with famin: And thus I leaue the discourse of their voyce with the annotation of Seruius: Vlulare canum est & furiare. To howle is the voyce of dogs and furies. Although there be great difference of colours in wolues, as already I haue shewed, yet most commonly they are gray and hoary, that is, white mixed with o∣ther colours, and therefore the Graecians in imitation therof, do cal their twie-light which is betwixt day and night, as it were participating of black and white Licophos, wolfe-light, because the vpper side of the wolues haire is browne, and the neather part white. It is said, that the shaggy haire of a wolfe is full of virmin and wormes, and it may well be, for it hath beene proued, that the skin of a sheep which was killed by a wolfe, breedeth wormes. The braines of a wolfe do decrease and encrease with the Moon, and their eies are yel∣low black, and very bright, sending forth beames like fire, The seueral partes & carrying in them apparant tokens of wrath and mallice; and for this cause it is said they see better in the night then in the day, being herein vnlike vnto men, that see better in the day then in the night, for rea∣son giueth light to their eyes, and appetite to beasts, and therfore of ancient time the wolfe was dedicated to the Sun, for the quicknesse of his seeing sence, and because he seeth far. And such as is the quicknesse of his sence in seeing, such also it is in smelling, Coelius Stumpsius for it is repor∣ted, that in time of hunger by the benefit of the wind, hee smelleth his prey a mile and a halfe or two mile off: for their teeth they are called Charcharodontes, that is sawed, yet they are smooth, sharp, and vnequall, and therefore bite deepe, as we haue shewed already, for this cause the sharpest bits of horses are called Lupata. All beasts that are deuourers of flesh doe open their mouths wide, that they may bite more strongly, and especially the wolfe. The necke of a wolfe standeth on a straight bone that canot well bend, therefore like the Hyaena, when he would looke backwards he must turne round about, the same necke is short which argueth a trecherous nature. It is saide that if the heart of a wolfe be kept dry, it rendreth a most fragrant or sweet smelling sauor. The liuer of a VVolfe is like to a horses hoofe, and in the blather there is found a certaine stone cald Syrites, being in colour like Saffron or Honny, yet inwardly containe certaine weake shining stars: this is not the stone called Syriacus or Indiacus, which is desired for the vertue of it against the stone in the blather. The forefeet haue fiue distinct towes, and the hinder feet but 4. because the forefeet serue in stead of hands, in Lyons, dogs, wolues, and Panthers. VVe haue spoken already of their celerity in running, and therefore they are not compared to Lions which go foot by foot, but vnto the swiftest Dogs. It is sayd they will swim, and go into the water two by two, euery one hanging vpon anothers taile, which they take in their mouthes, and therefore they are compared to the daies of the yeare, which do successiuely follow one another, being therfore called Lucabas. For by this successiue swimming they are better strengthned against impression of the flouds, and not lost in the waters by any ouerflowing waues or billowes. The meat & voracity of Wolues. Great is the voracity of this beast, for they are so insatiable that they deuoure haire and bones with the fleshe which they eat, for which cause they render it whole againe in their excrements, and therefore they neuer grow fat. It was well sayd of a learned man: Lupus vorat potius quam commedit carnes, & pauco vtitur potu. That is, A wolfe is rather to rauen then to eat his meat. VVhen they are hungry they rage much, & although they be nourished tame, yet can they not a∣bide any man to look vpon them while they eat; when they are once satisfied, Aelianus Philes they endure hunger a great time, for their bellies standeth out, their tongue swelleth, their mouth is stopped, for when they haue droue away their hunger with aboundance of meate, they are vnto men and beasts as meeke as lambs, til they be hungry again, neither are they mo∣ued to rapine, though they go through a flock of sheep: but in short time after, their bellies and tongue are calling for more meat, and then saith mine Author. In antiquā frigrā redit, iterumque lupus existit. That is, They returne to their former conditions, and become as rauening as they were before; Neither ought this to seem strange vnto any man, for the like things are formerly reported of the Lyon, and it is said that vvolues are most dange∣rous to be met vvithal tovvards the euening, because of their fasting al the day before, and for this is alledged the saying of holy scripture vvhere the prophets make mention of Lupi Vespertini, but vve haue shevved already in the story of the Hyaena, vvhat those signifie. It is said that Wolues doe also eate a kind of earth called Argilla, which they doe not for hunger, but to make their bellies waigh heauy, to the intent, that when they set vpon a Horsse, an Oxe, a Hart, an Elke, or some such strong beast, they may waigh the heaui∣er, and hang fast at their throates till they haue pulled them downe, for by vertue of that tenetious earth, their teeth are sharpened, and the waight of their bodies encreased; but when they haue killed the beast that they set vpon, before they touch any part of his flesh, by a kind of natural vomit, . they disgorge themselues, and empty their bellies of the earth, as vnprofitable food. The remainder of their meate they alwaies couer in the earth: and if there be many of them in hunting together, they equally deuide the prey among them all, and some∣times it is saide, that they howle and call their fellowes to that feast which are absent, if their prey be plentifull. Now this they haue common with Lyons, in their greatest ex∣tremity of hunger, that when they haue election of a man and a beast, they forsake the Man and take the Beast. Some are of opinion, that when they are olde they grow weary of their liues, and that therefore they come vnto Citties and Villages, offering them∣selues to be killed by men, but this thing by the relation of Niphus is a very fable; for hee professeth that he saw an old Wolfe come into a Village, and set vpon a Virgin to destroy and eate her, yet he was so old that he had scarse any teeth in his head, but by good hap company being at hand, the maid was saued, and the Wolfe was killed. Now those Wolues that are most sluggish and least giuen to hunting, are most ready to venture vpon men, because they loue not to take much paines in getting their liuing: This Wolfe is called Vinipeta, but the industrious Hunting Wolfe Kunegeiseia. It is repor∣ted that a Wolfe will neuer venture vpon a liuing man, except he haue formerly tasted of the flesh of a dead man, but of these things I haue no certainety, but rather doe beleeue the contrary; that like as Tyrants in an euill grieued estate, do pick quarrels against euery man that is rich for the spoyle of their goods, accounting them their enimies, how well soeuer they haue deserued at their handes. In like manner, Wolues in the time of their hunger fall vpon all Creatures that come in the way, whether they be Men or Beastes, without partiality to fill their bellies, and that especially in the winter time, wherein they are not afraid to come to houses and citties. They deuoure Dogges when they get them alone, and Elkes in the kingdome of Nor∣way, but for Dogges it hath beene seene, that they haue liued in a kind of society and fel∣lowship with Wolues, but it was to steale and deuoure in the night time, like as Theeues do couer their mallice and secret grudges one to other, when they are going about to rob true men. Wolues are enimies to Asses, Bulles, and Foxes, for they feede vppon their flesh, and there is no Beast that they take more easily then an Asse, killing him without all daunger, as we haue shewed already in the story of an Asse. They also deuoure Goates and Swyne of all sortes, except Bores, who doe not easily yeald vnto Wolues. It is said that a Sow hath resisted a Wolfe, and that when he figh∣teth with her, hee is forced to vse his greatest craft and suttelty, leaping to and from her with his best actiuity, least she should lay her teeth vpon him, and so at one time deceiue him of his prey, and depriue him of his life. It is reported of one that saw a Wolfe in a Wood, take in his mouth a peece of Timber of some thirty or forty pound waight, and with that he did practise to leape ouer the trunke of a tree that lay vpon the earth; at length when he perceiued his own ability and dexterity in leaping with that waight in his mouth, he did there make his caue and lodged behinde that tree; at last it fortuned there came a wild S w to seeke for meat along by that tree, with diuers of her pigs following her, of different age, some a yeare old, some halfe a yeare, and some lesse. When he saw them neare him, he suddenly set vpon one of them, which he coniectured was about the waite of Wood which he carried in his mouth, and when he had taken him, whilest the old Sow came to deliuer her pig at his first crying, he suddenly leaped ouer the tree with the pig in his mouth, and so was the poore Sow beguiled of her young one, for she could not leape after him, and yet might stand and see the Wolfe to eate the pigge which hee had taken from her. It is also sayd, that when they will deceiue Goates, they come vnto them with the greene leaues and small boughes of Osiers in their mouthes, wherewithall they know Goats are delighted that so they may draw them therewith, as to a baite to deuoure them. Their manner is when they fal vpon a Goat or a Hog, or some such other beast of smal stature, not to kil them, but to lead them by the eare withal the speed they can driue them to their fellow Wolues, and if the beast be stubborne and wil not runne with him, then he beateth his hinder parts with his taile, in the mean time holding his ear fast in his mouth, whereby he causeth the poore beast to run as fast or faster then himselfe vnto the place of his owne execution, where he findeth a crew of rauening Wolues to entertaine him, who at his first appearance seize vpon him, and like Diuels teare him in peeces in a moment, leauing nothing vneaten but onely his bowels. But if it be a swine that is so gotten, then it is said, that they lead him to the waters and there kil him, for if they eat him not out of cold water, their teeth doth burne with an vn∣tolerable heat. The Harts when they haue lost their hornes doelie in secret, feeding by night for feare of the Wolues vntil their hornes do grow againe which are their cheefest defence. The least kind of VVolues we haue shewed already, doe liue vppon the hunting of Hares, and generally al of them are enemies to sheepe, for the foolish sheep in the day time is easily beguiled by the Wolfe, who at the sight of the sheepe maketh an extraordi∣nary noise with his foot, whereby he calleth the foolish sheepe vnto him; for standing a∣mazed at the noise he falleth into his mouth and is deuoured: but when the Wolfe in the night time commeth vnto a folde of sheep; he first of al compasseth it round about, watch∣ing both the Shepheard and the Dogge, whether they be asleepe or awake, for if they be present and like to resist, then he departeth without dooing any harme, but if they be ab∣sent or asleepe, then looseth he no opportunity, but entereth into the sold, and falleth a killing, neuer giuing ouer til he haue destroyed al, except he be hindered by the approch of e or other; for his manner is not to eat any til he haue killed al, Textor, Albertus. not because hee fea∣reth the ouer-liuers wil tel tales, but for that his insatiable mind thinketh he can neuer bee satisfied, and then when al are slaine he falleth to eat one of them. Now although there be great difference betwixt him and a Bul both in strength and sta∣ture, yet is he not affraid to aduenture combat, trusting in his policy more then his vigor, for when he setteth vpon a Bul, he commeth not vpon the front for feare of his hornes, nor yet behind him for feare of his heeles, but first of al standeth a loofe from him, Aelianus. with his glaring eyes, daring and prouoking the Bul, making often prosers, to come neere vn∣to him, yet is wise enough to keepe aloofe till he spy his aduauntage, and then he leapeth suddenly vpon the backe of the Bull at the one side, and being so ascended, taketh suche hold that he killeth the beast before he loosen his teeth. It is also worth the obseruation, how he draweth vnto him a Calfe that wandereth from the dam, for by singular treache∣rie he taketh him by the nose, first drawing him forwarde, and then the poore beast stri∣ueth and draweth backward, and thus they struggle togither, one pulling one way, and the other another, till at last the Wolfe perceiuing aduantage, and feeling when the calfe pulleth heauyest, suddenly he letteth go his hold, whereby the poore beast falleth backe vpon his buttocks, and so downe right vpon his backe; then flyeth the Wolfe to his bel∣ly which is then his vpper part, and easily teareth out his bowels, so satisfieng his hunger-greedy appetite: But if they chance to see a Beast in the water, or in the marsh, emcom∣bred with mire, they come round about him, stopping vp al the passages where he shold come out, baying at him, and threatning him, so as the poore distressed Oxe plungeth himselfe many times ouer head and ears, or at the least wise they so vex him in the mire, that they neuer suffer him to come out aliue. At last when they perceiue him to be dead and cleane without life by suffocation, It is notable to obserue their singular subtilty to drawe him out of the mire, whereby they may eat him; for one of them goeth in, and taketh the beast by the taile, who draweth with al the power he can, for wit without strength may better kil a liue Beast, then remoue a dead one out of the mire: therefore he looketh behind him and calleth for more helpe; then presently another of the wolues taketh that first wolues tail in his mouth, and a third wolfe the seconds, a fourth the thirds, a fift the fourth, and so forward, encreasing theyr strength, vntil they haue pulled the beast out into the dry lande: whereby you may see, how they torment and stretch their owne bodies, biting their tailes mutually, pinching and straining euery ioynt vntil they haue compassed their desire, and that no man shold thinke it strange for a Wolfe to kil an Oxe, It is reported that Danaus did build a temple to Apollo at Argos, in the very same place where he saw a Wolfe destroy an Oxe, because he receiued instruction thereby, that he should be king of Greece. Wolues are also ene∣mies to the Buffes, and this is no maruaile, seeing that it is confidently reported by Aeli∣anus, that in time of great famine when they get no meat, they destroy one another; for when they meet together, each one bemoaning himselfe to other, as it were by consent they run round in a circle, and that Wolfe which is first giddy, being not able to stande, falleth downe to the ground, and is deuoured by the residue, for they teare him in pee∣ces, before they can arise againe. The aun of Wolues Pliny affirmeth that there be Wolues in Italy, whose sight is hurtfull to men, for when a man seeth one of them, though he haue neuer so much desire to cry out, yet hee hath no power: but the meaning of this is, as we find in other writers, that if a Wolfe first see a man, the man is silent, and cannot speake, but if the man see the Wolfe, the Wolfe is silent and canot cry, otherwise the tale is fabulous and superstitious, and thereupon came the prouerbe Lupus in fabula est, to signifie silence. Now although these things are repor∣ted by Plato, Ruellius, Vincentius, & Ambros, yet I rather beleeue them to be fabulous thē true, howbeit Albertus writeth, that when a man is in such extremity, if he haue power but to loose his cloke or garment from his backe, he shal recouer his voice again. And Sextus saith, that in case one of these Wolues do see a man first, if he haue about him the tip of a wolues taile he shal not neede to feare anie harme. There be a number of such like tales concerning wolues and other creatures, (as that of Pithagoras ) A beast making water vp∣on the vrine of a wolfe, shal neuer conceiue with young. All domestical Foure▪footed-beasts, which see the eie of a wolfe in the hand of a man, wil presently feare and runne a∣way. If the taile of a wolfe be hung in the cratch of Oxen, they can neuer eat their meate. If a horse tread vpon the foote-steps of a wolfe which is vnder a Horse-man or Rider, hee breaketh in peeces, or else standeth amazed. If a wolfe treadeth in the footsteppes of a horse which draweth a waggon, he cleaueth fast in the rode, as if he were frozen. If a mare with foale tread vpon the footsteps of a wolfe, she casteth her foal, and there¦fore the Egyptians when they signifie abortment, doe picture a mare treading vppon a wolues foot. These and such other things are reported, (but I cannot tell how true) as su∣pernatural accidents in wolues. The wolfe also laboureth to ouercome the Leoparde, and followeth him from place to place, but forasmuch as they dare not aduenture vpon him single or hand to hand, they gather multitudes and so deuoure them. VVhen wolues set vpon wilde Bores, Or although they bee at variance amonge themselues, yet they giue ouer their mutual combats, and ioyne together against the VVolfe their common aduersarie. For these occasions a wolfe hath euermore bin accounted a most fyerce and wilde beast, as may further appeare by this Historie following. A history. VVhen Euristines and Procles intended to marie the Daughters of some Graecian, that so they might ioyne themselues in perpe∣tual league and amity by affinity, they went to Delphos to aske counsel of Apollo ▪: in what place they should meet with their wiues. Apollo gaue them answere, that when they should meet with an extreame wild beast, as they went into Lacedemonia, and yet the same beaste appeare meeke and gentle vnto them, there they should take their wiues. When they came into the land of the Cleonians they met with a wolfe carrying a lambe in his mouth, whereupon they conceiued that the meaning of Apollo was, that when they met with a wolfe in that country, they might very happily and successiuely take them wiues, and so they did, for they married with the daughters of Thesander Cleonimus, a verie honest man of that countrey. It is repor∣ted of Milo Crotaniata, that valiant strong man, how vpon a season rending a tree in sunder in the woods, destroy by wolues one of his armes was taken in the closing of the tree, & he had not strength enough to loose it againe, but remained there inclosed in most horrible torments vntill a wolfe came and deuoured him. The like story vnto this, is that which Aelianus reporteth of Gelon the Syracusan, a schol∣ler, vnto whome there came a Wolfe as he sat in the schoole writing on his Tables, Coelius. Tzetzes. and tooke the writing tables out of his hand. The schoolemaister being inraged heerewith, and knowing himselfe to be a valiant man, tooke hold of the same tables in the VVolues mouth, and the VVolfe drew the maister and schollers in hope of recouery of the tables out of the schoole into a plaine field, where sodainely hee destroyed the schoole-maister and a hundered schollers, sparing none but Gelon, whose tables were a baite for that prey, for hee was not onely not slaine, but preserued by the VVolfe to the singular admiration of al the world; whereby it was collected, that that accident did not happen naturally, but by the oueruling hand of God; Now for these occasions, as also because that the wooll and skin of beasts killed by wolues, are good for nothing, (although the flesh of sheepe is more sweeter) are vnprofitable and good for nothing. Men haue bin forced to inuent and find out many deuises for the destroying of wolues, The taking of Wolues & the reward of the hunters. for necessity hath taught men much learning, and it had beene a shameful misery to in∣dure the tyranny of such spoiling beastes without labouring for resistaunce and reuenge: for this cause they propounded also a reward to such as killed VVolues, for by the law of Dracho, he that killed a young wolfe receiued a tallent, and he that killed an old wolfe re∣ceiued two talents. Solon prescribed that hee that brought a VVolfe aliue, shoulde receiue fiue peeces of mony, and he that brought one dead, should receiue two. Apollo himselfe was called Ly∣coctonos, a wolfe-killer, because he taught the people how to put away wolues. Homer cal∣leth Appollo Lysegenes, for that it is saide immediately after hee was borne of his mother Latona, he was chaunged into the shape of a wolfe, and so nourished; and for this cause there was the image of a wolfe set vp at Delphos before him. Others say, that the reason of that ymage was, because that when the temple of Delphos was robbed, and the treasure thereof hid in the grounde, while diligent inquisition was made after the theeues, there came a wolf and brought them to the place where the gol∣den vessels were couered in the earth, which she pulled out with her feete. And some say that a wolfe did kil the sacriliger, as he lay asleepe on the mountaine Parnassus, hauing all the treasure about him, and that euery day she came downe to the gates of Delphos how∣ling, vntil some of the Cittizens followed her into the mountaine, where shee shewed them the theefe and the treasure both together. But I list not to follow or stand vpon these fables. The true cause why Apollo was called a VVolfe killer was, for that he was feined to be a shepheard or Heardsman, and therefore in loue of his catle to whom wolues were e∣nemies, he did not onely kil them while he was aliue, but also they were offered vnto him in sacrifice, for wolues were sacred to Apollo, Iupiter and Mars : and therefore wee read of Apollo Lycius or Lyceus, to whom there were many temples builded, and of Iupiter Lyceus the sacrifices instituted vnto him called Lycaea, and games by the same name. There were other holly-daies cald Luper calia, wherein barren women did chastice themselues naked because they bare no children, hoping thereby to gaine the frutefulnesse of the wombe, whereof Ouid speaketh thus: Excipe foecunde pascientur verbera dextrae Iam socer optatum nomen habebit saui. Propertius and some other writers seeme to be of the mind that those were first instituted by Fabius, Lupercus as appeareth by these verses: Verbera pellitus setosamouebat arator Vnde liceus Fabius sacra lupercus habet. And Inuenal thus: Nec prodest agili palmas praebere luperco. Now concerning the manner of taking of VVolues, Diuers poli∣cies and in∣uentions to take wolues. the Auncients haue inuented manic deuises and gins, and first of al an yron Toyle which they stil fasten in the earth with iron pins, vpon which pins they leaue a ring, being in compasse about the bignes of a wolues head, in the midst whereof they lay a peece of flesh, and couer the Toyle, so that nothing is seene but the flesh, when the Wolfe commeth and taketh holde of the flesh, feeling it sticke, pulling hard, he pulleth vp the ring, which bringeth the whole Toyle on his necke and sharpe pins. This is the first manner that Crescentiensis repeateth of taking Wolues, and he saith there are other deuises to ensnare their feet, which the Reader cannot vnder∣stand except he saw them with his eies. The Italians cal the nets wherein wolues are taken, Tagliola, Harpago, Lo Rampino, and Lycino, the French Hauspied, and Blondus affirmeth, that the shepheardes of Italy make a certaine ginne with a net, wherein that part of the Wolfe is taken which is first put into it. Now the manner of taking Wolues in ditches and pits is diuers, first of all they dig a deep ditch, so as the wolfe being taken, may not get out of it, vpon this pitte they lay a hurdle, and within vpon the pillar they set a liue Goose or Lambe, when the Wolfe windeth his prey or booty, he commeth vpon the trench, and seeing it at a little hole which is left open on purpose to cast the wolfe into the deepe ditch, and some vse to lay vpon it a weak hur∣dle, such as wil not beare vp either a man or a beast, that so when the wolfe commeth vp∣on it, it may breake, and he fal downe, but the best deuise in my opinion that euer was in∣uented in this kind, is that the pertch and hurdle may be so made, and the bait so set, that when one wolfe is fallen downe it may rise againe of it one accord, and stand as it did be∣fore to entrap another; and great care must bee had, that these kinde of ditches may bee made in solide and strong earth, or if the place affoorde not that opportunity, then must the inside be lined with boords, to the intent that the beast by scraping and digging with his feet make no euasion. The Rhaetians vse to raise vp to a Tree a certaine engine like a mouse-trappe but much greater, through which there is a cord where they hange a bate of flesh or pullin, or some such thing which the wolfe loueth; when he commeth vnto it, hee suddenly snatcheth at it, and so pulleth the trap vpon his owne pate. The Teucreans, Mysseans, and Thraseans, in∣habitants of Asia, were wont to carry short weapons to kil wolues, and they vsed also the strongest Dogges, who by the incoragement of the hunters would tear the wolues in pie∣ces, for there is hardly any Dogge so couragious, as to aduenture vppon a Wolfe at sin∣gle hand. The Dogges haue therefore certaine collers made vnto them of leather stuft full of sharp yron nails, to the intent that their necks may be sauegarded from the wolues biting. Now Blondus saith, that al hunting of Wolues with Doggs is in vaine, except there be al∣so set vp certaine great nets made of strong cords, stretched out and standing as stiffe as may be immouably fastned to the bodies of trees, or strong pillars in the earth, and in di∣uers places of these nettes they must set boughes to couer them, to the end the wolfe de∣scry them not; and at either end of the net must be made a little shedde vvith boughes to couer a man, wherein the hunter must lodge with his speare, readie to pierce through the Wolfe when he perceiueth him in the net, for if the wolfe be not instantly wounded, hee will deliuer himselfe and escape, and then also he must bee followed with the cry of men and Dogges, that he may not returne backe againe into his den, and the hunters obserue this order in hunting of a Wolfe, and driuing him to their nets. VVhen they are farre from theyr nets, they hunt them but gently, and let him go at lei∣sure, but vvhen they are closer and nearer vnto them, they follovv them vvith al speed and violence, for by that meanes many are intrapped and suddenly killed, and these are those hunting obseruations which I find to be recorded in Authors for the taking of VVolues. And this is the nature of this beast, that he feareth no kind of weapon except a stone, for if a stone be cast at him, he presently falleth downe to auoide the stroke, for it is saide that in that place of his body where he is wounded by a stone, there are bred certaine wormes vvhich doe kill and destroie him; and therefore the Egyptians vvhen they doe decipher a man that feareth an eminent danger, they picture a vvolfe and a stone; as Orus vvriteth. Wolues do likevvise feare fire euen as Lyons doe, and therefore they vvhich trauell in woods and secret places by night, vvherein there is anie suspicion of meeting of Wolues, they carry with them a coople of flints, where withall they strike fire, in the approach of the rauening beast which so dazleth his eies, & danteth his courage, that he runneth away fearefully. It is said that wolues are afraid of the noise of swords or iron strucke together, and it may well be, for there is a true story of a man traueling neare Basil, with a bell in his hand, who when he saw that the throwing stones at the wolfe which followed him would nothing auaile, and by chance fel downe, in he meanetime a bell which he carried about him did giue a sound, at which sound the wolfe being affrighted ran away, which when he perceiued, he sounded the bell aloud, and so droue away the wild rauening beast. As the Lyon is afraid of a white Cocke and a Mouse, so is the wolfe of a Sea-crab or shrimp. It is said that the pipe of Pithocaris did represse the violence of wolues when they set vpon him, for he sounded the same vnperfectly, and indestinctly, at the noise whereof the raging wolfe ran away; and it hath bin beleeued that the voice of a singing man or Woman wor∣keth the same effect. Horace testifieth so much of himselfe, that by singing he droue away a wolfe, as in these verses; Nam{que} me sylua lupus in sabina, Dum meam canto tellagen & vltra, Terminum cur is vagor expeditus, Fugit niermem. Quale portentum ne{que} militaris, Daunia in latis alit aesculetis, Nec iubetellus gener at leonem, Arida nutrix. If at any time a wolfe follow a man a far off, as it were trecherously to set vppon him sud∣denly and destroy him, let him but set vp a stick or staffe, or some such other knowledga∣ble marke, in the middle space betwixt him and the wolfe, and it will fear him away; for the suspitious beast feareth such a man, and thinketh that he carrieth about him some engin or trap to take away his life: and therefore also it is said, that if a trauailer doe draw after him a long rod or pole, or a bundle of sticks & clouts, a wolfe will neuer set vpon him, worthily mistrusting some deserued pollicy to ouerthrow & catch him. Aesculapius writeth, that if a man do anoint himselfe with the fat or sewet taken out of the raines of a Lyon, it wil driue avvay from him all kind of Wolues. There bee some that take vvolues by poisoning, for they poyson certaine peeces of meat, and cast them abroad, vvhereof when the vvolues do eate, they die immediately. There were certaine country men which brought the skins of wolues into the citty of Rome, and carried them vp and downe the streets publikely to be seene, affirming that they had killed those wolues with the powder of a certaine hearb cald Cardus Varius, and that therewithall also they could kil Rats and Mice. Pausanius saith, that there was a temple of Apollo Lyceus, at Sicycon, and that on a time the inhabitants were so anoyed with wolues, that they could receiue no commodity by their flockes, wherevpon Apollo taking pitty of them, told them that there was in their temple a certaine peece of dry wood, commaunding them to pull off the rinde or barke of that wood, and beating it to powder, to mingle it with conuenient meat for Wolues, and so cast it abroad in the fieldes. The people did as they were commaunded by the Oracle, and thereby destroyed al the wolues; but what kind of wood this was, neither Pausanias nor any of the pristes of Sicycon could declare. In one part of the world the Ewe-tree, and certaine fragments of Iuniper. The spindle tree, and Rododaphne do yeald poison vnto wolues mixed in their drinke, and besides them we know no trees that are venemous, and yet plants innumerable, especial∣ly wolfe bane. And the occasion why there are more poysonfull herbs then trees, is in the iuyce or liquor whereby they are nourished, for where the iuyce is wholesome and well tempered, there it encreaseth into a great tree, but where it is imperfect and venomous, there it neuer groweth tall, nor bringeth forth any great stocke. There are certain litle Fishes called by the Graecians Lycos, and by the Latanists blenni, which we may english wolfe-Fishes, & these the Hunters vse to take wolues in this maner, when they haue taken a great many of them aliue; they put them into some tub or great morter, ther kil them by bruising them to pieces, afterwards they make a fire of coles in the mountains where the wolues hant, putting into the same some of these fishes mixed with blood and peeces of mutton, and so leauing it, to haue the sauour thereof carryed euery way with the winde, they go and hide themselues: whilst that in the mean time the Wolues inraged with the sauour of this fire, seeke too and fro to finde it, because of the smell, the fire before they come is quenched or goeth out naturally, and the Wolues by the smoke therof, especially by tasting of the flesh, blood and fish which there they find, do fall into a drowsie dead sleepe, which when the Hunters do perceiue, they come vpon them and cut their throats. The Armenians do poison them with blacke fishes, & some do take a cat, pulling off her skin, taking out the bowels, they put into her belly the powder of Frogges, this cat is boiled a little vpon coles, and by a man drawne vp and down in the mountaines where wolues do hant, now if the Wolues do chance to meet with the traine of this cat, they instantly followe after him, inraged without all feare of man to attaine it, therefore he which draweth the catte, is accompanied with another hunter armed with a a Gun, Pistoll, or Cross bow, that at the appearaunce of the Wolfe, and before his ap∣proach to the traine, he may destroy and kill him. Poysyning of Wolues I will not discourse of Wolfe-bane, commonly called Aconitum in Latine, wherwith∣all both men & beasts are intoxicated, and especially Wolues, but referring the Reader to the long discourse of Conradus Gesner in his History of the Wolf, I will onely remem∣ber in this place an Epigram of Ausonius wherein he pleasantly relateth a story of an adul∣terated women, desiring to make away her iealous husband, and that with speed and ve∣hemency, gaue him a drinke of Wolfe-bane and Quick-siluer mingled together, eyther of both single are poison, but compounded are a purgation, the Epigram is this that followeth: Toxica zelotypo dedit vxor mecha marito Nec satis ad mortem credidit esse datum, Miscuit argenti letalia pondera viui Cogeret vt celerem vis geminata necem Diuidat haec si quis faciunt discreta, venenum Antidotum sumet qui sociata bibet, Ergo inter sese dum noxia pocula certant, Cessit letalis noxa salutiferae Protinus & vacuos alui petiere recessus, Lubrica deiectis qua via nota cibis. Concerning the enimies of Wolues, there is no doubt but that such a rauening beast hath fewe friendes, for except in the time of copulation wherein they mingle sometime with dogges, The enimies of Wolues and sometime with Leopards, and sometime with other beastes, all Beastes both great and small do auoyd their society and fellowship, for it cannot be safe for stran∣gers to liue with them in any league or amity, seeing in their extremity they deuour one another: for this cause, in some of the inferiour beasts their hatred lasteth after death, as many Authors haue obserued; for if a sheepe skinne be hanged vp with a Wolues skin, the Wool falleth off from it, and if an instrument be stringed with stringes made of both these beasts, the one will giue no sounde in the presence of the other; but of this matter we haue spoken in the story of the sheep, shewing the opinion of the best learned, concer∣ning the truth heereof. The Rauens are in perpetuall enmity with Wolues, and the Anti∣phathy of their natures is so violent, that it is reported by Philes and Aelianus, that if a ra∣uen eat of the carcasse of a beast which the wolfe hath kild, or formerly tasted of, she pre∣sently dyeth. There are certaine wilde Onions called Scille, and some say the sea-Onion, because the roote hath the similitude of an Onion, of all other thinges this is hatefull to a wolfe, and therefore the Arabians say, that by treading on it his legge falleth into a crampe, where∣by his whole body many times endureth insufferable torments, for the crampe increa∣seth into convulsions; for which cause it is worthy to be obserued how vnspeakle the Lord is in all his workes, for whereas the wolfe is an enemy to the fox and the Turtle, he hath gi∣uen secret instinct and knowledge both to this beast and Foule, of the vertu us operati∣on of this hearbe against the rauening wolfe; for in their absence from their ne s, they leaue this Onion in the mouth thereof, as a sure gard to keepe their young ones from the wolfe. There are certaine Eagles in Tartaria which are tamed, who doo of their owne ac∣cord being set on by men aduenture vpon wolues, and so vex them with their talants, that a man with no labor or difficulty may kil the beast, & for this cause the wolues do greatly feare them and auoid them; And thereupon came the common prouerb, Lupus fugit a∣quilam : And thus much shall suffice to haue spoken in general concerning their taking. Now we will proceed to the other parts of their History, and first of al of their carnal co∣pulation. They ingender in the same manner as dogs and Sea-calues do, Their Copu∣lation & pro∣creation and therefore in the middle of their copulation they cleaue together against their wil. It is obserued that they begin to engender immediately after Christmasse, and this rage of their lust lasteth but twelue daies, whereupon there was wont to go a fabulous tale or reason, that the cause why al of them conceiued in the twelue daies after Christmas was, for that Latona so ma∣ny daies togither wandered in the shape of a shee wolfe in the mountaines Hyperborei for for feare of Iuno, in which likenes shee was brought to Delus ; but this fable is confuted by Plutarch, rehearsing the words of Antipater in his booke of beastes, for he saith when the Oakes that beare Acornes do begin to cast their flowers or blossoms, then the wolues by eating thereof do open their wombes, for where there is no plenty of Acornes there the yong ones die in the dam belly, and therefore such countries wherein there are no store of Oakes, are freed from wolues; and this he saith is the true cause why they conceiue but once a yeare, and that onely in the xii. daies of Christmas, for those Okes flower but once a year, namely, in the spring time, at which season the wolues bring forth their yong ones. For the time that they go with young▪ and the number of whelps, they agree with dogs, that is, they beare their young nine weeks, and bring foorth many blind whelps at a time, according to the manner of those that haue manie clawes on their feet. Their legges are without Articles, and therefore they are not able to go at the time of their littering, and there is a vulgar opinion that a she wolfe doth neuer in al her life bring foorth aboue nine at a time, whereof the last which she bringeth forth in hir old age is a dog, throgh weak∣nes and infirmity: but the Rhaesians among whom wolues do abound, do affirme constant∣ly, that in the beginning of May, they bring their young out of their dens, and lead them to the water, sometimes seauen, and sometimes nine, euery yeare increasing their num∣ber; so that the first yeare she littereth one whelpe, the second yeare two, the thirde yeare three, and so obserueth the same proportion vnto nine, after which time she groweth bar∣ren and neuer beareth more: and it is said when shee bringeth her young ones to the wa∣ter, she obserueth their drinking very diligently, for if any of them lap water like a dogge, him she reiecteth as vnworthy of her parentage, but those which sucke their water like a swine, or bite at it like a Beare, them she taketh to hir, and norisheth very carefully. VVe haue said already that wolues do engender not only among themselues, but among other beasts, and such are to be vnderstood of them which beare their young an equal proporti∣on of time, as of Dogges and Wolues commeth the Lupus canarius, or Panther, and the Crocuta. Of the Hyaena and the wolfe come the Thoes, of whome wee shal speake in their due place in the end of this story, and the Hyaena it selfe seemeth to bee compounded of a wolfe and a fox. Concerning the naturall disposition of this beast we haue already spoken in part, and now we wil adde that which doth remaine; The epithets and natural disposition. and first of al their Epithites which are attributed vnto them among seueral Authors are most cleare demonstrations of their disposition; as sowre, wilde, Apulean, sharp, fierce, bold, greedy, who are, flesh-eater, wary, swift, bloody, blood-louer, degenerate, hard, glutton, hungrie, Cattle-eater, famishing, fu∣rious, yellow, fasting, vngentle, vnhonest, vntameful, harmeful, Cattle-hurter, teeth-gna∣sher, insatiable, treacherer, martial, sorrowful, mountanie, nightly, robber, strate, rauener, mad, snatcher, cruel, pack-bearer, blood-sucker, fomer, proud, fearing, sullen, terrible, ve∣hement, houling, and such other like belonging to the male wolfe. Now vnto the female there are some peculiar ones also, as in human, vngentle, martial, obscure, ranke, rauener, sanded, Romulian, greasie, terrible, and Volscaen, and the rauening desire of this wolfe doeth not only apeare in the prouerbs of holy scripture already repeated, as where Christ com∣pareth the Hereticks to wolues, but also from hand instruments and sicknesses, for a little hand-saw is called of the Latins and Germans Lupus, a wolfe; because of the inequalitie of the teeth, wherewithall a man sheareth asunder violently any piece of wood, bones, or such like thing. There is a disease called a wolfe, because it consumeth and eateth vp the flesh in the bodie next the sore, and must euery day be fed with fresh meat, as Lambes, Pigeons, and such other things wherein is bloode, or else it consumeth al the flesh of the body, leauing not so much as the skin to couer the bones. Also the gals on a mans seat, which commeth by horse-riding, are by the auncientes called Lupi, and by Martiall, Ficus, whereof he made this disticon; Stragula succincti venator sume veredi Nam solet à nudo surgere ficus equo. There be also instruments called Lupi and Harpages, or Harpagones, wherewithal Ankers are loosed in the sea, or any thing taken out of the deepe. There is a certaine territorie in Ireland, (whereof M. Cambden writeth) that the inhabitants which liue till they be past fif∣ty yeare old, are foolishly reported to be turned into wolues, the true cause whereof hee coniectureth to be because for the most patt they are vexed with the disease called Lycan∣thropia which is a kind of melancholy causing the persons so affected, about the moneth of February to forsake their owne dwelling or houses, and to run out into the woodes, or neare the graues and sepulchers of men, howling and barking like Dogs and wolues. The true signes of this disease are thus described by Marcellus : those saith he which are thus af∣fected haue their faces pale, their eies dry and hollow, looking drousily and cannot weep. Their tongue as if it were al scabd, being very rough, neither can they spit, and they are very thirsty, hauing many vlcers breaking out of their bodies, especiallie on their legges, this disease some cal Lycaon, and men oppressed therewith, Lycaones, because that there was one Lycaon as it is fained by the poets, who for his wickednes or sacrificing of a child, was by Iupiter turned into a Wolf, being vtterly distracted of human vnderstanding, and that which the poets speake of him, may very wel agree with melancholy, for thus writeth Ouid: Territus ipse fugit, nactus{que} silentia ruris Exululat frustra{que} loqui couatur. And this is most strange, that men thus diseased should desire the graues of the dead. Like vnto this is another disease, called by Bellunensis, demonium leoninum, which is saith he, con∣fusio rationis cum factis malis, noxijs & iracundis à leone dictum videtur malum, quod eo de∣tenti alios homines laedant, & leonum instar in eos saeuiant, that is; the Lyon-diuel disease is a confusion of reason, ioyned with wrathful, and impious facts, and it seemeth to bee na∣med of Lyons, because that such as are oppressed therewith, doe rage against men, and wound them like Lyons. There is a pretty Apologie of a league that was made betwixt the Wolues and the sheepe, The apology of Wolues & Lambs. whereupon came the vvord Lycophilios, my Author rehearseth it thus: Lupis et agnis faedus aliquando fuit, datis vtrin{que} obsidibus, lupi suos catulos, oues canum cho rtem dedere. Quietis ouibus ac pascentibus lupuli matrum de siderio vlulatus adunt, tum lu∣pi irruentes fidem faedus{que} solutum clamitant, oues{que} canum praesidio destitutas laniant, that is to say, There was a peace made betwixt the wolues and the sheepe, either side giuing ostages to other, the wolues gaue their young whelpes, and the sheepe gaue the shepheards dogs to the wolues. Now when the young Wolues were among the flocke of sheepe they hou∣led for their dams, which vvhen the old vvolues heard, they came rushing in vppon the sheep, crying out that they had broken the league, and therfore they destroyed the sheep in the absence of the dogs that should keepe them: whereby is notably signified the sim∣plicity of innocent men, and the impiety of the wicked, for whatsoeuer bondes of truce and peace are made with them, they euer respect their owne aduantage, taking any smal occasion like Wolues at the crying of their young ones, without al offence of the inno∣cent and harmeles, to breake through the brazen wals of truce, peace, and amity, for the execution of their bloody and vngodly minds. The particu∣lar dispositiō of Wolues VVolues are truely said to be fierce and treacherous, and not generous and bold, and noble like Lyons. They especially rage in the time of their hunger, and then they kil not so much as wil suffice, but al the flocke before them; but being satisfied, as we haue saide already, they seeme rather Lambes then Wolues. The male is alwaies as carefull of the young ones as the female, for while shee suckleth her younge ones, hee bringeth meate vnto her in the denne, and when that they are greatly constrained both to fly away, they carry their young ones along with them. Great is their malice towards them that hurte them as Niphus saith, he tried one day when he was a hunting neare Rome, for his Dogge was fighting with a Wolfe, and he comming in with the multitude of hunters, alighted from his horse, drew his sword, and gaue the Wolfe a wound, the wolfe feeling the stroke of the sword, forsooke the Dogge and turned vppon the man, making all force at him he could to bite him, but he professed he escaped with singular danger, more by the help of his fellow-hunters, then by his owne valor; wherefore he concludeth that as Wolues are enimies to al, so they take special reuenge of them that harm them, as we haue said be∣fore of Lyons. Some say that when many of them haue obteined a spoile, they do equal∣ly deuide it among them al, I am sure the like is reported betwixt the olde Lyon and the young, but whether it be true in Wolues I cannot tell, but rather thinke the contrary, be∣cause they are insatiable and neuer thinke they haue enough. And Albertus saith, they do not communicate their prey like Lyons, but when they haue fed sufficiently, they hide the residue in the ground til they hunger againe. VVhen they set vppon horned beasts, they inuade them behinde, and on their backs; when they set vppon sheepe, they chuse a darke cloudy day or time, that so they may e∣scape more freely; and to the intent that their treadinges should not be heard, they licke the bottome or soles of their feet, for by that meanes they make no noise among the dry leaues, and if going along they chance to breake a sticke, and so against their mind make a noise, then presently they bite their foot, as if it were guilty of that offence: For the most part they set vpon such Cattle as haue no keepers, and rauen in secret. If they come vnto a flocke of sheep where there are Dogges, they first of al consider whether they bee able to make their party good, for if they see they cannot match the Dogges, they depart a∣way, although they haue begun the spoile, but if they perceiue their forces to be equal or superiour, then they diuide themselues into three rankes, one companie of them killeth sneepe, a second company fighteth with the Dogs, and the third setteth vppon the men. When they are in daunger to be taken by the hunters, they bite off the tip of their tailes, and therefore the Egyptians when they woulde describe a man deliuered out of extremi∣ty and danger, do picture a wolf lacking that part of his taile. To conclude, when they are in perill they are extreamely fearefull, astonished, and affraide, especially when they are vnauoidably included they seeme harmles, and this argueth the basenesse of their mind which is subtil, cowardlie and treacherous; daring do nothing but for the belly, and not then neither, but vppon a singular aduantage, and for the manifesting heereof, I will ex∣presse these two stories following, as they were related to Gesner by Michaell Herus, and Instinius Goblerus. It hapned (saith the first), that a certaine wolfe constrained by famine, came vnto a village neare Millan in Italy, and there entered into a certaine house, wherein fat the good wife and her children, the poore woman being terrified heerewith, and not knowing what she did, ran out of the house, pulling the dore to after her, and so shutting the wolfe in among her children; at last her husband returned home, vnto whom she re∣lated the accident, and how she had shut vp the wolfe; the man being more affraide then was cause, least the wolfe had deuoured some of his children, entered hastily in a doors, longing to saue and deliuer his poore infants, whom the feareful mother had left with the wolfe, when he came in he found al wel, for the wolfe was in worse case, astonished, ama∣zed, daunted, and standing like a stocke without sence, not able to run awaie, but as it were offering himselfe to be destroied: And this is the first history. The second is like vnto this, but more admirable, for the great Vnckle of Goblerus be∣ing marueilously addicted to the hunting of wilde beasts, had in his lande diuers ditches and trenches cast vp with other pittes and caues wrought verie artificiallie for the safe kee∣ping of such beasts as should fal into them. Now it hapned that vpon one Sabboth daie at night there fel into one of those pits three creatures of diuers disposition, and aduerse inclination, none of them being able to get out thereof: the first was a Neighbors wife of his, a poore woman, which going to the field to gather Beets and rapes for hir meate the day following, it fortuned that she fel downe by a mischance into the said pitte, where∣in she was faine to lodge al night (you must thinke with great anguish, sorrow, and peril∣lous daunger to hir self) beside that which hir husband and family conceiued at home, but she had not tarried long in the said pitte ere a Fox vvas likewise taken and fel dovvne vpon her, now began her griefe to be encreased, fearing least the wilde beast should bite and wound her, hauing no meanes to escape from him, nor no man to helpe and rescue her, although she cryed as loud as euer she could; wherewithall being wearied, necessity made hir to be patient, being a little comforted to see the Foxe as much affraid of her, as she was of him, and yet she thought the night ful long, wishing for the breake of the day, when men stir abroad to their labors, hoping that some or other would hear hir mone, and deliuer her from the society of such a Chamber fellow: while thus she thoght, striuing be∣twixt hope, feare, and griefe, loe what befell her more wofully then before, for suddenly a wolfe was taken and fell downe vpon her, then she lost her hope, and in lamentable maner thinking of husband and children, how little they conceiued of her extremity, resolued to to forsake the world, and commended her soule to God, making no other reckoning but that her distressed leane lims should now be a supper and breakefast to the Wolfe, wish∣ing that she might but see her husbande, and kisse her children before shee lost her life by that sauage execution; but all her wishes could not preuaile, nor cleare her hart from fear and expectation of an vnauoidable death: while thus she mused, she saw the wolfe lie down, she sitting in the one corner, and the Fox resting in another, and the wolf apaled as much as either of boeth, so the woman had no harme but an ill nightes lodging, with the feare whereof she was almost out of her wits. Earely in the morning came his great vnckle the hunter to looke vpon his trenches and pits what was taken, and comming vnto that pitte, he found, a trebble prey; a Woman, a Wolfe, and a Fox, whereat he was greatly amazed and stepped a litle backward at the first sight the woman seeing him cryed out, calling him by his name, and praying his aide: he knowing her by her voice, presently leaped dovvne into the pit; (for he was a valiant man) and vvith his weapon first slue the wolfe, and then the Foxe, and so deliuered the vvoman from the feare of them, yet there was forced to leaue her till he went and fetched a ladder, for she was notable to come foorth as he vvas; then hauing brought the ladder, he went down againe into the pit, and brought her forth vppon his shoulders, in that manner deliuering her safe to her husband and family. Now these two stories doe plainely set forth, that a VVolfe dareth doe nothing when hee is in feare himselfe. Of tamed Wolues. It hath beene a question whether VVolues can be tamed or no, some say that they are alwaies wilde and can neuer be tamed. Albertus writeth, that being taken whelpes, they are tamed and wil play like Dogges, yet he saith, they neuer forget their hatered against the hunter and the desire of Lambes or other beastes which are deuoured by VVolues, whensoeuer he goeth abroad. And Stumpsius writeth, that euen when they are tamed they are angry with their maisters that looke vpon them while they eat their meat. Strabo writeth a fable of two woods among the auncient Veneti, one of them dedica∣ted to Iuno, and the other to Diana, and he woulde make the worlde beleeue, that therein the VVolues liued peaceably and gently with the Hartes, and did come to the handes of men like familiar and tame Dogges, suffering themselues to be stroked with their hands. Aelianus and Stephanus doe say, that neare the plaine of Meotis, there are Wolues vvhich liue like tame Dogges with men, being continually conuersant amonge the Fisher-men, and these Wolues do part stakes and deuide their prey vvith the inhabitants dwelling vp∣on the Sea-shores, and there is such a mutuall charitye and commons obserued betwixt them and the men, for sometimes the wolues take fishes when the men take none, and then they part with the wolfe, sometimes the men take fishes when the wolues haue none, and thus they liue together in quiet maner like confederats, each one releeuing and hel∣ping other; but if the men at any time break vvith the wolus, and do not giue them a share, they recompence their ingratitude and falsehood with tearing in pieces their nets: which thing if it be true, is a singular example of that rare concord and agreement vvhich vvas primitiuely ordained by God to be betwixt man and beast; Some say these kind of wolues bee Otters, hut I rather beleeue that they be Sea-wolues, of whome wee shal talke pre∣sently. There be many magical inuentions about the parts of wolues, namely, their heades, teeth, eares, tails & priuy parts, which I wil not stand to recite in this place, because I can∣not tel what benefit shal come to the knovvledge of them by the English Reader. VVolues are subiect to the same diseases that dogs are, especially the swellings of the throat, mad∣nesse, and the gout: when they are sicke they eat of an hearb which make them cast, some say it is ground Iuy, some say it is grasse, and some otherwise, of this they eate when they haue a paine in their bellyes, and not otherwise. Albertus. The reason why Dogs and Wolues are more subiect to madnesse then any other Beast, is because their bodies are chollerick, and their braines encrease and decrease with the Moone. If a man be bitten by a madde Wolfe, he is to be cured by the same medicines that are applyed to the bitings of a mad Dogge. They liue very long, euen vntill they loose their teeth, therefore in their old age oppressed with famin they fly vnto citties and houses to seeke meat. They haue no friends but the Parrots. A Wolfe was once the part of the armes of Rome, The wolfe hath no friend but the Parrot. and the iudgment seat at Athens had in it the picture of a Wolfe. There were ancient coines of mony stamped with the image of a wolfe, both among the Graecians, and among the Romans, which were therefore deuised, because Romulus and Remus were said to be nursed by a wolfe: with the skins of wolues after they were dressed by Curriers, we do read that there were garmentes made, where withall great princes and Noble men were cloathed, the bare being inward next to their bodies, and the rough being outward, these were vsed in iournies and hun∣tings, and they were the proper garment of the gaurds of Tyrants: And this shall suffice of the vulgar wolfe. OF THE SEA-WOLFE. A Lthough nothing hath hitherto beene brought to light, concerning the sea∣wolfe of the ancient writers that I know, yet his form is notable to be obserued and you may chuse whether you wil cal him a Theefe or a Sea-monster, much differing from the wolfe-fish, as that he seemeth to challenge a particular de∣scription or treatise. It is also a Foure-footed. Beast that liueth both on sea & land, satisfi∣ing his hunger on the most part vpon fishes: It hath bin seene vpon the Brittaine Ocean shoare, and it doth resemble the wolfe that liueth on the land, that it is not vndeseruedly called among the common people a wolfe. It doth liue also a long time being tamed, it hath a dangerous head, & very many haires growing on both sides of his eies to shaddow them, his Nosthrils and teeth are like vnto a dogs, and strong haires growing about his mouth: also smal bristles growing vpright vp∣on his back: and adorned and marked on euery side with black distinct spots, a long taile, Bellonius. thick and hairy, al the other parts being like to a wolues, as you may easily see by this expres∣sed picture: and vnto this belongeth the story of the Wolues last before expressed which liue vpon fishes, and deuide them familiarly with men. OF THE THOES. T Here are two kinds of Thoes, as there are of Panthers, dif∣fering onely in magnitude or greatnesse. But the lesser Thoes is like vnto the lesser Panther, Pliny a Licopanther, and the Lupus canarius engendered betwixt a Wolfe and a Dogge, are all one Foure footed beast. The Thoes also are a kind of Wolfe. And: Bellu: And againe, there is a kind of Wolfe which Aristotle doth call Chabez, but Auicen doeth write, that it ought to be called Beruet, in the Persian tongue. And a∣gaine in another place, where he doth write, that the Lion and the Thoes are vtter enemies, and Albertus doth translate it, that a Wolfe doth fight with the Foure-footed-Beast Toboz, which is a corrupted word, Toboz for Thoes, as Cabez for Thohoz, and this some men think it to be the Lynx. Thoes is called in Haebrew Tahas, Alshali is a Foure-footed-Beast like to a Wolfe. Adeditach is also a kinde of Wolfe, but I doe not know whether these names belong onely to the Thoes, or to any other kind of Wolfe. Solinus doth call Thoas Aethiopian Wolues, and a little before he sayd that Lycaon was an Aethiopian wolfe, mained on the Necke, and so diuers coloured that a man would thinke there were no co∣lours wanting in them. The people of Schythia likewise say, that the Buff doth change his colours, neither is there any other beast couered with haire, except the Lycaon among the Indians, (as Pliny also writeth) and besides this there is no mention made of the Lycaon among all the anci∣ent writers. Lycaons are called Dogs, in the story of the diuersities of Dogges. The lesser kind of Thoes are the best, for some make two kinde of Thoes, and some three, and these like Birds, and other Foure-footed-beastes, change their colour, both in VVinter and Summer, so that sometime they appeare bare, and againe at other times rough all o∣uer, that is, bare in the Summer, and rough in the VVinter, but it doth plainely seeme that there is no more kind of Thoes but one, which the things that come after doth proue and make manifest. Nearchus saith, that those Tygers are not true Tygers, which are commonly called Tigers, but changable Thoes (as if that euery Thoes were not changable) and greater then the other Thoes. Arrian They haue no reason which take the Lupus ceruarius for a Thoes, which wee haue alrea∣dy shewed to be a Lynx, for the Rhaecians which speak Italian, and the Sauoyans do to this day call him Ceruario, and for the Armenian VVolfe the Cicatus, and the Lupus canarius we haue already shewed, that it is a Panther, and therefore it is needlesse to stand any lon∣ger vppon those names in this place. VVee will therefore take it for confessed, that the Thoes is a Beast engendered betwixt a VVolfe and a Foxe, whereof some are greater and some smaller, and these are found about the Mountaine Pangeus, Cittus, Olympus, Myssi∣us, Pindus, and Nisa, beyound Syria, resembling for the most part a Hyaena, hauing a lon∣ger body, and a straighter taile then a VVolfe, and although it bee not so high of stature, yet it is as nimble and as strong as is the VVolfe, and it seemeth that the very name Thoes is taken from the celerity and swiftnesse in running and leaping, for it getteth his liuing by the quicknesse of his feet. In the outward face it much resembleth a VVolfe his Father, but in the spots and length of his body it resembleth a Panther his mother; they couple in generation like dogs, bringing forth two or foure at a time like wolues, which are blinde, and their feet clouen into many toes. They are enimies to Lyons, and therefore they doe not liue in the same place where Lyons are, not onely because they liue vpon the same victuals and food, but also because they are a more pittifull creature then they, especially to man, for if they see the face of a man at any time, they run vnto him and do him all such reuerence as their brutish nature can demonstrate. And further Philes and Selius write, that if they see a man oppressed by any other beast, they runne and fight for him, although it be with the Lyon, not sparing to offer their owne liues, and to spend their dearest bloud in the defence of him, who by secret in∣stinct of nature they vnderstand to be ordained of God, the King and chiefest of all world∣ly creatures: therefore Gratius calleth this kind, semiferam Thoem de sanguine prolem, and of their taming and fighting with Lyons, he speaketh: —Thoes commissos leones Et subiere astu, et paruis domuere lacertis. They liue for the most part vppon Harts, whom they take in the swiftnes of their course, these they bite and sucke their bloud, then sufferring them to runne away to some Moun∣taines thether they followe them and take them the second time, not destroying them all at once, but by distance of time, whereby the harts bloud groweth sweeter vnto them, and they haue the better appetite thereunto to destroy them. The Licopanthers, and also the beast Pathyon whereof Albertus speaketh, I doe take to be two seuerall distinct beasts from the Thoes, although the quantitie and stature agree, and I see no cause if there bee a∣ny such beast in the world, but that wee may truly say they are a lesser kind of Panthers: And this shall suffice to haue said of these beasts, which are deemed to bee of the kind of Wolues, wherein we haue endeuored to say so much of the generall and especiall as wee coulde collecte out of any good Authors; and thus wee wyll shut vp the Storie of the Woulfe with a short rememberance of his medicinall vertues. The Midicines of a Woulfe. A Woulfe being sodden aliue vntill the bones doe only remaine, is very much com∣mended for the paines of the goute, or a liue Woulfe steeped in oile and couered with waxe, is also good for the same disease. The skinne of a woulfe being tasted of those which are bit of a mad or rauenous dog, doth preserue them from the feare or hazard of falling into water. The skinne of a woulfe is very profitable for those which are troubled with the wind collicke, if it be bound fast a∣bout the belley: and also if the person so affected doeth sit vppon the said skinne, it will much auaile him. If any labouring or trauailing man doth were the skinne of a woulfe a∣bout his feete, his shooes shall neuer paine or trouble him. The skinne of a woulfe being new plucked off from him, and especially when it hath the naturall heat in it, and so row∣led about the member where the crampe is, is verie effectuall against it. The bloud of a woulfe beeing mixed with oyle, is very profitable against the deafe∣nesse of the eares. The dunge and bloud of a woulfe is much commended, for those that are troubled with the collicke and stone. The bloud of a Bucke, Foxe, or Woulfe being warme, and so taken in drinke, is of much force against the disease of the stone. He which doth eate the skinne of a woulfe well tempered and sodden, will keepe him from all euill dreames, and cause him to take his rest quietlie. The flesh of a woulfe being sodden, and taken in meate, doth helpe those that are lunaticke. The flesh of a woulfe being eaten, is good for procreation of children. You may read more things in the Chapter going before, concerning remedies of the flesh of a woulfe taken in meate. The fat of a woulfe is no lesse efficable, then the flesh. The fat of a woulfe doth very much profit, being anointed vppon those whose ioyntes are broken. Some of the later writers were wont to mingle the fat of the woulfe, with other ointments for the disease of the goute. Some also doe mingle it with other ointments, for the paulsey. It doth soften also the Vula, being anointed thereon. The same also being rub∣bed vppon the eies, is very profitable for the bleardnesse or bloudshot of the eies. Plinie. Sextus. The head also of a woulfe is very good for those that are weake to sleepe vppon, beeing layed vnder ther pillowe. The head of a woulfe being burned into ashes, is a speciall remedie for the loosenes of teeth. The right eie of a woulfe being salted, and bound to the body, doth driue away all agues ad feauers. The eie of a woulfe being rubbed vppon the eie, doth diminish all diseases that rise in the sight of the eie, and it doth also take away al markes or prints being made with hot irons. The right eie of a wolfe also is profitable for those that are troubled with stiches on the right side of the belly, and the left eye of a wolfe for pains on the left side. The right eie of a wolfe is very good against the bitings of dogs. Also the eye of a wolfe is much commended for those that are lunaticke by the bitinges of dogges. The teeth of a wolfe being rubbed vpon the gums of young infants, doth open them, whereby the teeth may the easier come forth. Slundus. Againe, the gums of children are loosened with the tooth of a Dog, being gently rubbed theron, but they are sooner brought forth with the teeth of a Wolfe. Some men do commend the tongue of a wolfe to bee eaten of those that are troubled with the falling sicknesse. The artery which springeth in the throat of a wolfe being taken in drink, is a most certaine cure against the Squincy. The throat of a Wolfe taken in drinke, is very much commended for those that are troubled with the falling sicknesse. The lungs or lights of a Wolfe being sodden and dryed, and mingled with pepper, and so taken in milke, is very profitable for those that are puffed vp, or swol∣len in the belly. The heart of a wolfe being burned and beaten to powder, and so taken in drinke, doth help those that are sicke of the falling sicknesse. Take one ounce of the gum of an Oake, and halfe an ounce of the gum of a peare tree, and two drams of the powder made of the top of a Harts horne, and one dram of the hart of a wolfe, al which being mingled togither, and made into medicine, is alwaies vsed for the cure of al vlcers: but it wil be more effectual if thou dost adde thereto the hinder part of the skull of a man beaten to powder. The Ly∣uer of a wolfe is of no lesse vertue then the lungs or lights, which I haue manifested in the medicines of the Foxe. The liuer of a Wolfe helpeth or profiteth those that are sick of the falling sicknesse. The liuer of a wolfe being washed in the best white, and so taken, is very good for those diseases that arise in the liuer. The liuer of a wolfe mixed in the medicine made of Liuerwort, is very much commended for the diseases in the liuer. Galen also doth say, that he hath holpen those which haue bin diseased in the liuer, only vsing the me∣dicine made of Liuerwort, and he saith if he did apply any other medicine thereto, it did little or nothing at all profit him. The Lyuer of a Wolfe is very profitable for those that are troubled with the skurfe in the mouth. The Lyuer or laps of a wolfe is much vsed for those that are troubled with dis∣eases in the liuer, but you must dry it and afterwards beat it to powder, and so giue the par∣ty so affected one dramme of it in sweet wine. The liuer laps of a Wolfe saith Marcellus, being dryed and beaten to powder, and a little part of it mingled in like portions with the powder made of Fene greeke, of Lupines, Wormewood, and of the Hearbe called Her∣ba mariae, and so mingled that it may be about the quantity of a cup full, and so giuen him that day which hee is not troubled with the feauer, but if he shall be troubled with it, let him take it in water for the space of three dayes, and after hee hath drunke it, let him lie for the space of halfe an houre with his armes spread abroad: and afterwardes let him walk very often, but eate very sildome, and let him be sure he keepe himselfe for the spact of those three daies well ordered, and from drinking any cold drinke, or eating any salor sweet thing, and within a little space after he shall bee freed from that disease. The liuer laps of a Wolfe being wrapped in bay leaues, and so set to dry at the Sunne or at the fire, and being dryed beate it to powder in a Morter, first taking away the leaues very wari∣ly, which being powdered, you must keepe it in a cleane vessell, and when you giue it him to drinke, you must adde thereto, two leaues of Spoonewort, with tenne graines of pep∣per beaten very small, and as much clarified Hony as is needfull, and also made hot with a hot burning Iron, and mingled very diligently in a Morter, which being so warmed, you must giue him to drinke sitting right vp in his bed, that after he hath taken the potion, he may lye downe on his right side for the space of an houre, Auicen. drawing his knees together, and after that hee hath done so, let him walke vp and downe for the space of an houre, and this will likewise cure him of the same disease. Auicen doth set downe a medicine concerning the cure of the hardnesse of the Liuer, which is, take Opium, Henbane, Oyle made of Beauers stones, Myrrhe, Saffron, Spick∣nard, Agrimony, the Lyuer of a Wolfe, and the right Horne of a Goat burned, Dioscorides of each equall partes, and make thereof a Medicine. The Lyuer of a Wolfe being made in the forme of a dry electuary, and giuen as a lozeng, doth also very much profit against the diseases of the liuer. Gugir a Phylosopher doth affirme, Galen Pliny that the Lyuer of all liuing Beastes doth very much profit against all paines of the Lyuer. The Liuer of a Wolfe being througly dryed and drunke in sweete VVine, doth mitigate all griefes or paines of the Lyuer. The Liuer of the same beast to the quantity of a penny, taken in a pinte of sweete VVine, is very medi∣cinable for the curing of all paines in the Liuer whatsoeuer. The Liuer of a VVolfe be∣ing taken in hot VVine, doth perfectly cure the cough. If an intollerable Cough doth vex any man, let him take of the liuer of a wolfe, either dried or burnt, as much as he shall thinke conuenient, and therewith let him mingle VVine, Honny, and warme water, and afterward drinke the same fasting euery day, to the quantity of foure spoonefuls, and hee shall in short space be cured of the same. The laps or fillets of a VVolues Liuer, being applyed vnto the side, doth perfectly heale any sticth or pricking ach therein. The Liuer of a Wolfe being taken in sweete Wine, doth heale those which are troubled with a ptisicke. The Lyuer of a VVolfe be∣ing first boyled in Water, afterwardes dryed, beaten and mingled with some certaine potion, doth instantly heale the griefe and inflammation of the stomacke. The powder of a Wolues Lyuer mingled with white Wine, and drunke in the morning for some cer∣taine daies together, doth cure the Dropsie. The Liuer of a VVolfe taken either in meat or drinke, doth asswage the paines of the secret parts. Two spoonefuls of the powder of a Wolues Lyuer, being giuen in drinke, doeth cure all paines or sores of the mouth. The Gall of a VVolfe being bound vnto the Nauell of any man, doeth loosen the belly. The Gall of a VVolfe taken in wine, doth heale all paines in the fundament. The en∣trals of a VVolfe being washed in the best white VVine, blowen vpon, dryed in an Ouen, Syluius Albertus pounded into dust, afterwardes rowled in VVormewood, is a good and effectuall remedy against the Collicke and stone. If some part of the yard of a VVolfe being baked in an O∣uen, be eaten by any, either Man or VVoman, it instantly stirreth them vp to lust. Con∣cerning the genitall of a VVolfe I haue spoken before in the Medicines of the Foxe: but antiquity, as Pliny saith, doth teach that the genitall of Beasts which are bony, as wolues, Foxes, Ferrets, and VVeasels, are brought to an especiall remedye for many diseases. Rasis If any man take the right stone of a VVolfe being bloody, steepe it in Oyle, and giue it vnto any woman to apply it vnto their secret partes, being wrapped in VVooll, it instantly causeth her to forsake all carnall copulation, yea although she bee a common Strumpet. The same being taken in some certaine perfume, Marcellus doth help those which are troubled with the foule euill. The eyes being annointed with the excrementes of a wolfe, are instantly freed from all couers or spreadi g skinne therein. The powder of the same wolf being mingled with the sweetest Hony as can possible be had, and in the like manner rubbed or spread vpon the eyes, doth expell all dazeling from them. The fime of a Wolfe long rubbed, vntill it be very light, being mingled with Honny, by the vnction thereof, Galenus causeth the filth or scurfe growing about the eyes to auoyd away, and restoreth them to an exceeding clear∣nesse. The powder of a Wolues head being rubbed vpon the teeth, doth make fast and confirme the loosenesse thereof, and it is most certaine that in the excrementes of the same Beastes, there are certaine bones found, which being bound vnto the teeth, haue the same force and efficacy. The dung of a Wolfe or Dogge being beaten into small powder, mingled with Hony and annointed vpon the throate, doth cure the Quinsie or Squirisie, as also al other sores in the throat whatsoeuer. The fime of a Wolfe being giuen to those which are troubled with the Collicke to drinke, doth easily cure them, but this dung is more effectuall if it haue neuer touched ground, which is very hard to come by, but it is found by this means. The nature of the wolfe both in making his water, as also in voyding his excrements is like vnto a Dogs, for while he voydeth his Water he holdeth vp his hinder Leg, and voydeth his excrementes in some high or steepy place far from the earth, by which meanes it fal∣leth downe vpon bushes, thornes, fruites, Elder-trees, or some other Hearbes growing in those places, by which meanes it is found neuer touching the earth. There is further∣more found in the fime of Wolues certaine bones of Beasts which they haue deuoured, which for as much as they could not bee grinded or chawed, so also can they not be con∣cocted, which being beaten and bruised small, are by some commended to be excellent giuen in drinke for the ease of the Collicke, but if the grieued party shall be some fine or delicate person which cannot endure so grosse a Medicine, then mingle it with Salt, Pep∣per, or some such like thing, but it is most often giuen in sweet wine, so there be but a smal quantity thereof drunke at one time. But this dung which the Graecians cal Lagonas, and is to be applyed to the groin of the dis∣eased person, ought to bee hanged in a band made of wooll, but not of any wooll: But it would be more effectuall if it were made of the Wool of that Sheepe which was slaine by a Wolfe. But if the same cannot be got, then is it fit that there be two bands, one which may be bound about the groine, and another which may bee bound vppon the dung to keepe it from falling. There are also some which cast a small quantity of the same dung to the bignesse of a Beane in a little pot, fastening the same to any one which is troubled with the saide disease, and it healeth them (which in a manner seemeth incredible) in very short time. The dung of a Wolfe boyled in small white Wine, and afterwardes taken in drinke, is very profita∣ble for those which are troubled with the collick: and it is also reported that if the same dung be couered with the skin of the same Beast and hung vpon the thigh of any one which hath the collick being bound with a thread made of the wool of a sheep slaine by a wolfe, it will instantly cure the said disease. The fime of a Wolfe, so that it be not found vppon the earth, but vppon some trees, Brambles or Bul-rushes being kept, and when there shall bee neede bound vnto the arme of him that shall be troubled with the Collick, or to his Necke being included in a bone, or in Copper, and hung with the thread wherewith silke-women weaue, doth wonder∣fully and most speedily cure him, so there be great care had, that in the meane time there be a little of the same dung giuen to the grieued party to drinke, not knowing what it is. The dung of a Wolfe being taken, and the bones therein beaten into powder, mingle therewith cold water, giuing it to any one to drinke which is troubled with the stone, and it will instantly cure him. The Dung of a Wolfe beaten into the smallest powder then strained and giuen vnto any in his fit which is troubled therewith to the quantity of halfe a spoonefull in hot wa∣ter, is a very effectuall, and approued cure for the stone. The bones which are found in Wolues, being bound vnto the arme of any one which is troubled with the Collike, ha∣uing neuer touched the ground do with great speed and celerity cure him. The pasterne bone of a Hare found in the dung of a Wolfe, being bound vnto any part of the body of him which is troubled with the Collicke, doth very effectually cure him. The dung of a Wolfe with the Haires of a white Asse, and taken by any Woman in a certaine perfume, maketh her apt for conception. The teeth of a VVolfe are vnequall, wherefore their biting is very dangerous. A raue∣ning VVolfe by his biting bringeth the same danger, as a rauenous Dogge, they also are cured by the same Medicines, as we haue declared at large in the story of the Dog. The woundes which come by the teeth or Nailes of a VVolfe are very dangerous, for the filth which pierceth through al clouts or spunges which are laid vpon them: But they are cu∣red by no other meanes then the bitinges of Dogs: Aristotle writeth these things concer∣ning the biting of a Lyon, and not of a wolfe. Iohanes Vitus the Hungarian declared that there were certaine men in Hungary bitten by a mad VVolfe, and that they were as it seemed presently cured: But before forty daies expired they all dyed by a most bitter or painefull disease, small pieces of flesh encreasing through their Vrine in the forme of Dogges, with an exceeding paine or torment. It is also reported of a certaine Countrey man, who when hee had striken a Wolfe with his Club, and the Wolfe had so torne his face with his Nailes, that he pulled off the skinne, he was in short time healed that there appeared no signe of any harme, but in short time after he beganne to be sicke, and to howle like vnto a Dogge, and so perished; by which it was coniectured that that Wolfe was mad. An Oxe being bitten by a mad Wolfe or Dogge is cured by Garlike being beaten and rubbed vppon the wound: the Wolfe him∣selfe is also healed of any wound by old Salt flesh applyed vnto the same. Auicenna. Two drammes of Gentian being drunke in Wine, is an excellent cure for the bites of a mad Dogge and rauening Wolues, as also of all beastes tearing with their teeth or Nailes. The bites of Wolues being marked in the bodies of any Cattell are burned or seared with a hot yron, least that the biting bee assuredly hurtfull, may draw vnto it selfe corruption. And thus much shall suffice concerning the medicines of the Wolfe. OF THE ZEBEL, commonly called a Sabel. A Mong all the kindes of Weasels, Squirrels, Wood-Mice, wilde-mice, or other little Beasts of the world, there is none comparable to this Zebeth, commonly called in Latin Zebel∣lus, and Zobela, from whence the Germans call it Zobel, the Illirians and Pollonians Sobol, and Soboel, the Italians Sesi, and Sablines : the skins hereof are cald Zebellinae, and Zobellinae, & sometimes Zibellinae. It is bred in Muscouia, and the Nor∣therne partes of the Worlde, among the Lapones, but no where more plentifull then in Tartaria, Scythia, and Sarmasia, and it is therefore called by some Mus Scythicus, the Scythi∣an Mouse. The French-men because of the similitude it hath with a Martin, doe call it by a compounded name Marteis Soublineis. It liueth of the most part in the Woodes, being lesser then a Martin euery way, and hath also shorter Legges: they runne vppe and downe vpon trees like Squirrels, easily fastening their clawes in the boughes; when they leape their taile serueth instead of a Crosse beame to direct them: They bite most ireful, for their teeth are as sharp a Razors, and there is no beast in the World of their quantity so angry and terrible as they: their flesh is vnprofitable and good for nothing. The onely price and estimation of this beast is for the skinne, which farre excelleth all the skinnes of the World, either Ermins, Martins, or Foines, differing herein from the Martins, because their haire is thinner, and if you stroke them from the head to the taile, or on the contra∣ry from the taile to the head, they do lie euery way smooth, whereas the Martins do only fall smooth from the head to the taile. These are more subiect to Wormes then other skinnes, except they bee continually worne, or layd vp with bunches of VVormewood, but aboue all other thinges the laying of them open one day together in the Sunne or aire, doth him more harme then a whole yeares wearing, for the beast it selfe liueth euermore in shadowy places, forbearing the sun except she be hunted, and ketcheth small birds in secret. In the furthest part of Lit∣tuania they haue little or no Mony, and therfore the Marchants which traffick thether do exchange their wares for Zebel or Sabel skins; Those are the best which haue most white and yellow haires mingled in them, and the Garmentes of princes are onely fringed and lined with these Sabel skinnes, and honorable matrons, auncient Noble Men and their VViues doe likewise vse two or three of these to weare about their Neckes, for it is cer∣taine that a garment of these skinnes is much deerer then cloth of Gold, and I haue heard and also read, that there haue beene two thousand duckets payed for so many as were put in one cloake. It is a very libidinous and lustfull beast, and at that time stincketh very rankefully, wherefore it mingleth it selfe with Martins of all sortes that it meeteth: And thus much shall suffice to haue discoursed of this little beast. Now there are diuers other which seem to be of this kind, of which, though I haue not much to say, yet rather then they should be omitted, I will expresse their bare names, that so I may giue occasion to all our Country∣men that shall trauaile into other Nations, to make enquiery after them, that so at their returne if they haue any conscience of publique good, they may get themselues eternall fame and names, by communicating publikely their owne knowledge, experience, and learning, which they haue gained in these, or other Foure-footed-beasts. Of the Noertzs T His Beast is of the quantity of a Weasell, and by the Germans called Noerts, and Nerts, from which word the Latines haue their Noerza, for this Beast. It liueth (as Georgius Agricola writeth) in the Woods, betwixt Sweuia and Vistu∣la, the colour of the haires which is short and smooth, is for the most part like an Otters. Their skinnes are sold at Franckford by forty in a heape or bundle, they are long, and more red then the Ferrets, euery bundle most commonly is sold for sixe and twenty Nobles. Some thinke that this is the Latax, spoken off before, because it getteth his liuing in the waters. Of the Ʋarmel. T His Beast is called by the Latins Vormela, by the Germans Wormiein, it is lesse then a Ferret, the belly wherof is black, al the residue of the skin ful of white, pale, red, and yellow spots, which adorneth it in admirable man∣ner, very comely, and excellent to be looked vpon, the taile not past halfe a hand bredth long, the tip whereof is blacke, but the haires of the residue mixed with white and ashe colour together. There is another beast which for the variety of the colours, which are apparant in his skinne, he is called a Salamander, not that which liueth in the fier, but one like vnto it, ha∣uing a gentle haire, distinguished all ouer into blacke and yellow spots, and these because of our ignorance we reckon among our outlandish weasels. In India there is a little beast called Chiurca, hauing a very pretious skinne, and this (as Cardan writeth) hath a bag vnder the belly, wherein it suffereth his young ones to goe in and out, as before we haue said of the Simivulpa, or Foxe-Ape. There is another little Beast in Hungaria, called Vncken, which dwelleth in holes of the earth as Conies do, the outward proportion whereof is like a weasell, but it is much thin∣ner and longer, the colour of the backe is red, and all the residue of the body mouse co∣lour. Now although I do not read any speciall vse of the skin of this beast, yet I thought it good to name it in this place, because it is reported that the breathing thereof vppon the face of man, is venomous and poysonfull, for when Souldiers sleep in their tents vp∣on the earth, they come many times and looke in their faces and poyson them: And thus much for the Zebel, and the seuerall kinds of this little beast. OF THE ZIBETH, OR SIVET-CAT. T He best description that is of this beast in all the World that I could euer find, was taken by Doctour Cay, and thus sent as it is heere fi∣gured to Doctour Gesner with these words following. There came to my sight (saith Doctour Cay ) a Zibeth or Siuet very lately, which was brought out of Affrica, the picture and shape whereof in euery point I caused to be taken, which is this perfixed, so that one Egge is not more like another, then this is to the said Siuet or Zibet. It is greater then any Cat, and lesser then a Taxus, hauing a sharp face like a Martin, a short, round, blunt eare, which was black without but pale within, and on the brims, a blew skye-coloured eye, a foote and Legge blacke, and more broad or open then a Cats: Likewise a blacke claw, neither so crooked nor so hid in the foote as it is in a Cat, but their teeth are more fearefull and horrible. It is all spotted ouer the body, but the Nose thereof is blacke, the neather part of the vpper chap pale, and the middle part blacke, and from thence to the top of the head it is of the colour of a Badger. The lower chap was all blacke, and the bristles of the vpper chap were white, growing forth a of pale skinne, and a litle aboue the eye there were two other white ones growing forth of a black skinne. The throat thereof was blacke, and a little aboue the eye there arise three blacke lines or strakes: whereof the first or vppermost descendeth downe right to the throate: the se∣cond descendeth compasse in and out of the middle of the Necke: And the third downe to the shoulder, and then a little beneath that place on the contrary, arise two other blacke lines like circles ascending in the compasse of the shoulder to the backe bone: and all the residue of the body is distinguished and parted into many colours, hauing diuers and sun∣dry blacke spots scattered abruptly through out the whole circuit: whereof some are con∣tinued and ioyned together. For that which is vppon the backe is continued from the shoulder, and the second and third arising in that part, are broken and deuided, the fourth and all the residue are in like sort discontinued and separated one from the other, so that their position runneth all in length. The first part of his taile to the middle is spotted, and all the residue blacke. The haire both on the face, Legges, and feet, is soft, and very gentle to be handled, falling downe, but in all other parts of the body, it is harsh, deepe, and standing vpright: the spots doth both ascend and descend, the tongue hereof was smooth and not rugged, and vnder the taile was the passage for the excrements after the fashion in other Beastes, and a little be∣neath the same was the receptacle or bag containing the Siuet, and a little space after that the priuy part of the Male which was hid or sheathed in the body. The Beast being mo∣ued to anger, vttereth a voyce like to the voyce of an angry Cat, withal, doubling the let∣ter RR. but being not angry the voyce is like a young Cats, although lower. This Zibet was in length from the head to the taile, one foote, three palmes, and one Roman fingers breadth, but the breadth thereof vnder the belly, was one foot, two palmes, and three Roman fingers. It was a gentle and tractable Creature, and was solde for eight pounds of English mony, which was in French twenty foure Crowns, or in Florens forty and eight. These things are said by Doctour Cay. Now vnto this Gesner addeth, that he receiued such another picture from one Iohannes Kentmannus, which he tooke by another of these Cats in the possession of the Duke of Saxony, and hee said that it was bought by him for seuenty Taters (euery Tater being worth in our English mony eight pence halfe penny) in the yeare of the Lord 1545. This Beast is a very cleane Beast, I meane a hater of filthinesse; and therefore the place wherein it lyeth must be swept euery day, and the ves∣sels cleane washed. The Siuet or liquor distilled out of the Cod, must be taken away eue∣ry second or third day, or else the beast doth rub it forth of his owne accord, vppon some post in his kennel, if he be tamed or inclosed. This Siuet is an excrement not growing in the secret part onely, but in a peculiar receptacle by it selfe, increasing euery day the waight of a groat. The colour whereof at the beginning is like butter, but afterwardes it groweth more sad and browne: one ounce of it if it be pure and not sophisticated, is sold for eight Crownes at the least. There be impostours which do adulterate it with an ox∣es gall, Styrax, and Honny. This is of a strange sauour, and preferred before Muske by many degrees, yet it smelleth worst if it be held hard to the Nose: It is said that the liquor running out, doth go backe againe if any vessell be put to receiue it, except it be a Syluer Spoone, or Porringer. Leo Afer saith, these Beastes are wilde, vntamable, and liue vppon flesh, but the Euro∣paean Marchants buy of the young ones and nourish them tame, with Branne, Milke, hard Egges, and other things, and that so they conuay them into Europe out of Affrick, emp∣tying their cods twice or thrice a day in the hot Countries; and that this Siuet is nothing else but the sweat of the Beast vnder the ribbes, forelegges, Necke, and taile. There were diuers of these Zibets tamed among other. It is reported of a Consull of the Florentine Marchants at Alexandria that had one of these so tame, that it would play with a man and bite his Nose, eares, cheeks, or lips so gently, that it should not be felt, the reason where∣of was giuen, because it was at the first nourished with the Milke of a Woman. Cardinall Galeottus had three of these at Rome, which he kept for their Siuet, and Otho Duke of Ba∣uaria, had also one which he nourished with Sugar. They are bred in Aethiopia and In∣dia about the Citty Pegus and Tarnasari. Their Siuet is not sauory till it bee washed and clensed. It is said to be very excellent against the strangulations of the wombe, and it is good against the collicke, it hath also vertue to purge the wombes of women, to purge the braine, and is applyed to ma∣ny other diseases and infir∣mities. FINIS. An Epilogue to the Readers. T Hus haue I by the merciful goodnesse of the Lord arriued at the first of the foure portes of liuing creatures, whereunto I haue purposed to saile by Gods permission, of Beasts, Birdes, Fishes, Serpents, and all creeping imperfect creatures, and to discourse to all my Coun∣trimen that part of Diuinity that was neuer knowne in English. I take my owne Conscience to witnesse, which is manifest to my Judge and Sauiour, J haue inten¦ded nothing but his glory that is the Creator of all; and if I thought that heereby the world would not be the more prouoked to acknowledge and obey his so∣ueraign Maiestie, whilest that they behold as in EDEN the assembly of all known and vnknowne Beasts, but read the stories to feed curiositie, and behold their fi∣gures as Children do Babies, I would not onely desist and go no farther, but al∣so wish that this worke were buried in Obliuion, and the poore lame Paraliticke right hand which wrote and endited the same, were seuered from the bodie. Therefore (well minded Readers,) heerein you shall satisfie your owne consci∣ences and harts, when the visible thinges of the world, doe lead you to the invi∣sible things of God, and all these rowes and ranks of liuing Foure-footed-Beasts are as letters & Mid-wiues to saue the reuerence which is due to the highest (that made them) from perishing within you. If you thinke my endeauors and the Printers costs necessarie and commen∣dable, and if you would euer farther or second a good enterprize, J do require al men of conscience that shall euer hear, read, or see these Histories, or wish for the sight of the residue, to helpe vs with knowledge, and to certifie their particular ex∣periences in any kinde, or any one of the liuing Beastes: and withall to consider how great a task we do vndertake, trauelling for the content and benefit of other men, and therefore how acceptable it would be vnto vs, and procure euerlasting memorie to themselues, to be helpers, incouragers, ayders, procurers, maintai∣ners, and abettours, to such a labor and needefull endeuour, as was neuer before enterprized in England. If S. PETER did finde in one Fishes mouth a piece of mony which dischar∣ged his Maisters and his Subsidie. Jf ABELL that was the first man that hearded, and gaue himselfe to the knowledge both humane and Deuine, that is to be lear¦ned out of Cattle, was the first man that entered heauen. Jf an Angell opened the mouth of BALAAMS Asse who spake like a man, why should not we being com∣maunded with S. PETER to search al the workes of God, looke into the mouths of other Fishes, with expectation of commodity? or why shoulde not wee learne the seuerall vses, Deuine and humane, which God hath ordained in the natures of beasts? or why should not we in this our latter age of the world which run and ride to gaine wealth by the harme of the innocent as BALAAM did, haue our ac∣cursed Couetousnes reproued by the secret voices of Asses, I say no more of this worke but MARTIALS words: Casibus hic nullis, nullis hic delebilis annis, viuet, Apellaeum cum morietur opus. And so I conclude with the saying of S. Austen in his Booke de Gen. against the Manichees, where he speaketh thus of the Beasts and all creatures, Vsurpa vtilia caue pernitiosa, relinque superflua, in omnibus tamen cum mensuram & numeros & ordine vides, artificem quaere.
