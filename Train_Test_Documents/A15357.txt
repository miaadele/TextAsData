Barbary this be a story like a brief chronicle contain various and much matter in few line it be but a little bottom of time which you may hold and hide in your hand yet be unroll to the length it reach to the begin of many year past a word now must stand hear as in a map for a city and a few sheet for the chart of a spacious kingdom understand therefore that Abdela the emperor be dead Mulai Mahamet his brother succeed and be crown king of Barbary no soon be this dignity confer upon he but he revenge himself on those that in abdela reign love he not and therefore by their counsel do what in they lay to draw his brother the emperor affection from he yea so far that they persuade either to have his eye put out or be send to death of these counselor these three be chief Alcade Azus Alcade and Alcade Bardu from two of which he command their life but because his state need the head of wiseman to hold it up and for that he be not general belove of the nobility and some of the blood royal he give Alcade Azus his life and of a prisoner and a man in disgrace advance he up to high honour than before receive he every day into his bosom for his counsel which he do the rather because he know that Azus will be provident and careful to increase the emperor Bittelmell that be to say his treasury much and often be his mind perplex with thought about settle his empire his cogitation fight within themselves when sometime he will in his own private judgement make such a man fit to be of his secret and chief counsel and sometime another this he will like to day and to morrow utter distaste he at length he resolve to trust none of his own countryman but lay his heart in the breast of one of his elke that be to say a christian turn Moor yet upon sound contemplation he he reject too he will put the health of so great a kingdom into no such dangerous Physitiaus hand for he deliver that Mahamet his GOD will take all favour from he if he shall do so beside he that have forsake his own law and religion can not have the temper of constancy to serve one of a contrary religion nay how ever in outward show these elke or regadoe quoth he seem saint and holy one to i they may prove devil and hold it no conscience to betray my blood and kingdom Azus therefore be the man cull out from the rest by the emperor this prince flourish in as great glory as the great of his predecessor the bless fruit of sweet peace take away the sourness of any war either foreign or domestic that be serve in against he his subject be infinite his city fill with nation he have more wife than any of his forefather his concubine be fair and more in number he be as happy as ever be any king in Barbary in the flourish multitude of his people and as infortunate as ever any before he in behold their misery fortune twice have her pleasure upon he first in lift he up high in her love last in pursue he and his subject with her tyranny many noble and notable present themselves to the eye and ear of the world during his reign of which to write as they deserve be to add a large volume to the chronicle of that country I will therefore as one have be at a royal banquet reserve some of it to myself and bestow some upon other such as I think will be sweet in go down of which take this as part it be in his time when that great armada that bring terror in her womb from Spain be deliver of it in the narrow sea of England at the birth but indeed the burial of which invincible navy the spaniard that lay then in Barbary and attend on the spanish ambassador beguile themselves with a false rumour that this land be conquer prepare for triumph as if their joy have be tame beget they have reason but one master Arnold Tomson a english merchant certify to the emperor the truth and certain defeature of the spanish fleet the english man that be there have likewise leave of Mahamet to express their joy in bonfire and other triumph for the king do ever love the nation of our country and do many favour to our merchant the english ambassador lie in the same street where the spanish ambassador lie and our merchant gather together determine to ride into the field and there have put themselves into some gallant order to come back into the city in a triumphant and civil manner to do honour to their country for so happy and unheardof a victory behold before the spanish ambassador gate by which our countryman determine on horseback to pass stand a company of spaniard with some moor who they have hire arm with pike and shot to stop their passage between who what happen those english merchant the then be hurt of which master Arnold Tomson be one can if they be yet live testify and for those that be then slay outright the emperor in indignation swear not only that they who do execute this treachery upon the english nation shall have iron give they that be to say shall have their throat cut but he will also certify the king of Spain of this abuse so willing be he to do justice even to stranger another accident because it be worthy note for the example and may be a warning to our countryman will I set down and this be it a english man fall out and strike by his master desperate resolve while the fire be in his blood to revenge those blow on his body by give wound to his own soul and thereupon he present go and deny his religion forsake Christ to follow Mahomet and from a christian turn Moor it be the custom of that country when any man will do so to observe among other these ceremony it be signify to those christian that be in the city town etc. that such a one will be a elk or turn Moor a certain equal number therefore aswell barbarian as christian be assemble in a place fit for such purpose one part sit like judge on the one side the other opposite direct against they the turncoat just in the middle of the room between they and in presence of both he be there then demand whether he will deny the law of his own religion and embrace they or no it be offer unto he his free liberty to take the one or the other nay it be lawful for those that sit there on the contrary part be christian to use all the power of argument to win he from this delinguishment thus do they serve this man thus be he three several time convent before they and three several time do he most stiff defend what he have do and defy Christ no physic of spiritual counsel do good upon he they give he over but note the judgement of that captain the lord of host who colour of salvation he have forsake within a short time after this apostasy and rebellion of his soul this traitor to God happen to kill a man for which fact he be adjudge by the lady of that country not to lose his life but which be worse to live but how to live as the first murderer that ever draw blood of man as Cain live wander up and down with none on pain of death to keep he company but his own thought which be ten thousand executioner none to give he bread so that he feed upon despair none to quench his thirst so that he drink the poison of a infect conscience he know he have kill a man and therefore even infidel abhor he he know he have forsake his religion and therefore christian will not pity he in this wretehed state he go up and down in this misery he pine till he die let that death of his teach other how to line but leave this let we again fix our eye upon Mahamet the emperor who think it will be as great a glory to he to create other king as to be a king himself do by the advice of his counsel but most of all out of the work and height of his own spirit determine to divide his large and fruitful empire among his son of all the wife and concubine that this emperor have three only above the rest have a sovereignty over his amorous affection and of those three he do still prefer one before the other Lilia isa be the fair and she do he love dear she be empress over the rest yet be the rest queen over other she have the supreme command of the king house and none command she but the King Lilia Ageda be a negro yet have she a second place in his heart Lilia Myriem have the three of Lilia Myriem be a black woman likewise do he beget a son call muly-shem be one of the fair child that ever he have but this muly-shem offering some offence to a youth that attend on he be by he slay the youngman afterward know the emperor wrath kill himself Lilia agede be mother to muly-beferris and muly-sheck the young brother Lilia isa mother to muly-sidan the elder between these three be these late civil war in Barbary and thus do Mahamet make division of his kingdom which afterward breed division among his people and set all in a combustion to Mulai sidan who be give to arm and to love a soldier give he the kingdom Tadula and Taphalet to Mulibefarris who soul lust after nothing but sensual pleasure give he the kingdom of Sus to muly-sheck the kingdom of Fez appoint Mustapha that be bear a christian and turn Moor but a soldier and a gentleman of a noble spirit to attend on Sheck as his guardian because he be but young before we step any far it shall not be amiss because I will draw this barbary-picture with as much life and delightful colour as I can to set down a pretty combat between two of the emperor wife play before the emperor himself thus it be Mahamet sit one morning with Lilia Ageda the negro by he talk meary for he take pleasure in her speech because she be wise in come isa his fair bedfellow and see the blacke-one so near her belove she blush and show anger even in her eye for what woman will not be angry to see another rob she of the love of a emperor at length bow to the earth she fall at the king foot and with a pretty smile begin to tell a tale of the lark and the crow the shut up of her moral be that the lark be the bird of the morning and of the day and therefore may be bold to challenge the morning due and all rite of the day but the crow be the bird of the night and have nothing to do with the morning the emperor understand her sweet witty bitterness that by the lark thou mean herself and by the crow Lilia Ageda because of her blackness be so delight with the comparison that he give charge none shall ever after presume to give the emperor his good morrow till Lilia isa have be with he and thereupon be isa call the emperor lark or his bird of the morning let we lose one point more of our compass and sail a little out of our intend way to find out in what fear and awful reverence the subject of this kingdom hold the anger of their sovereign to understand which receive this only as a taste one of the emperor officer of his custom who name be cidde Abdela cream be a old man have one son only call Enhamet who he tender as his life be the hope and health of his age he have the father put into his own place the young man come in a morning betimes to the customhouse but the rest of the officer be not present he can not enter for every one have a several key and unless all be there together not one can get in he determine within himself to spend a hour till the rest meet in renew the emperor palace where his concubine live because he be tell it be a rare and rich place and that it be not lawful without great mean to enter that report more inflame his desire insomuch that in the end watch his time by stealth he get in where be and stare up and down it chance that one of the woman see he who present screek out and run cry a man a man for you must note that if any one of they spy a man except the eunuch that attend they and do not call for help it be death to she and what man soever rude presume to have a fight of they it be death to he it be know by inquiry upon her noise that it be Enhamet the customer son who have thus offend the law the emperor be give to understand so much make a oath he shall die for it immediate upon this by occasion of some business come the old man enhamets father to the king who suppose it have be about his son pardon and his indignation be now a little cool sudden demand of he what that man deserve that dare break into the place where his emperor concubine be cidde Abdela not suspect the offender answer that he deserve the sharp sentence of death for so the law will adjudge he be thou then quoth the emperor thy own son condemnation as thou have judge he so let it be but the king behold death sit in the old man face at that doom grow pitiful and for love he bear the father forgive the son which mercy notwithstanding Abdela cream not true lay hold of but mistake the noble spirit of a prince and imagine that this favour so strange extend be but a snare to entrap his own life because offence of that nature be never before pardon in any home he come with sorrow in his afflict look and his heart even murder within he by the cruelty of his own thought his son demand the cause of this so strange and sudden distemperature but his father give no answer send for cord show they only instead of speech and to make this dumb tragedy fall in the end he cause he before his own eye to be strangle great be the lamentation of the son and abundant be the tear he let fall to soften his father heart a mighty conflict be there in the poor old man bosom between natural piety to a child and natural fear of a sovereign but the last of the two prevail and have bestow upon the dead body the ceremony of the grave according to the custom of the country he cause the act to be register down for his own safety allege that howsoever the emperor when he hear this black and unnatural deed report will happy be move unto wrath yet inward he will be high content with it Mahamet be thus fear and love of his subject want nothing that according to human judgement can make a prince happy pleasure be his slave and weight on he whensoever he lust for her company riches flow into his house of treasure in large and golden stream his court be full of counsellor his cities full merchant his castle full of soldier he be a mighty king himself and have son that be as mighty as he their dominion be ample they be full of man and full of all thing that maintain man it seem that the father lose much of his imperial state and dignity when he place his three son like three great light to shine equal in his kingdom consider that all the beam of majesty that come from they may if he have please have be send forth from the centred glory of his own head but even this borrow reflection of they make his brightness the great and his son yield acknowledgement of all their royalty to flow from he do like river pay tribute to the sea seem not a whit the less for such homage and fealty fortune have turn the wheel of this emperor fate along time with steady hand have now bring it about to the uppermost point and high on which she mean he shall sit he shall be no more her darling and therefore she take her favour from he or to speak of a power that control fortune and who very finger throw down kingdom to utter confusion or hold they up in their greatness whether the general sin of the whole nation deserve it or whether the people be punish for the particular fault of the king and his courtier as many time it fall out and as it happen to the grecian for or for what other fault soever the rod of vengeance be make ready it be in man to think upon and fear but not to examine yet sure it be that as a fire catch hold at first but of some mean cottage in some one end or corner of a city have oftentimes ere the fury of it can be put out swallow up in his flame the goodly and most beautiful building that stand even far out of reach so do the cloud of infection burst open their vein and let fall the poison of they on this kingdom of Barbary if ever the plague in any place get his true name there he have it at the beginning it strike like a arrow on the head but of one city but in a short time after it phlegm from city to city and in the end stick in the very heart of the whole kingdom insomuch that death come like a tyrannous usurper to the court gate and threaten to depose the emperor himself he that before sit in his throne of majesty great fear of other nation round about he and strong guard by his own be on the sudden daunt and be account one of the mighty among the king of the earth be ready to submit to he with who even infant do every hour fight hand to hand see the authority fame and terror of that invader death he strike but up a alarm in this emperor palace and the emperor himself tremble through fear thereof his conceit that stand before like so many age oak bow present to the earth like so many rank of young willow yet his city shake at the voice no less then if it have be at a earthquake and so hardly do the pestilence pursue Mahamet that he dare not sleep for it in one place twice together every night be he compel for safety to fly unto a contrary lodging as his court remove so do the plague wheresoever the one keep his stand house there the other pitch up his pavilion as a proud and dare challenger to all comer insomuch that sickness in the end though weak of himself wrestle with so many that be near and about the prince person and still get the better of they that Mahomet have not man to remove those tent which he be enforce to carry up and down with he for his own household to lie in fourscore barbarian be all attendant and officer in court fall every night in this mortal and pestiferous massacre so that the emperor for want of servant be glad to take chain slave from the oar out of their galley and to make they his guard what a strange alteration be here of a court he that have see this prince so royal attend so majestical attire with such godlike reverence kneel unto so guard so follow so circle round with a nation in number infinite will that man have ever think that such a prince can have be drive out of his stately palace and be glad to lie abroad in the field or that he shall ever submit to such humility as to put his life into the hand of slave and miserable captive the only despise wretch of his kingdom the beggerly the most discontent the worst-minded to he and his nation yea such who he know can have be glad to cut his throat to ransom themselves from the bondage and hell of the galley yet even these most forlorn creature which before like ox be yoke by the neck with iron be this great monarch fain to make much of and to turn they into his best and fair courtier so easy and so low can the hand of heaven pull down the mighty upon earth and make they stoop even to the weak the heart be thus sick be not the whole body think you in danger to perish the eye of the kingdom be so much blemish do not the universal land dwell in darkness be it possible that the court shall pine and that the city shall flourish no no alas full house be empty there of whole family whole street of their household yea even the city themselves be leave desolate of inhabitant have all the Artificer in the land lay by all other work only to have make coffin they can not all have build room fast enough for the dead to dwell in for sickness be even weary of throw down body and death even glut with kill they do but imagine how the world show when all creature that be drown in the universal flood lay heap together after the water be shrink into the earth such a mount Calvary be Barbary the carcase of unbury man be so many that a far off they may be take for hill yea so numberless be they that it seem as if all the nation upon earth have send their dead thither and that Barbary have be the common churchyard when Vespasian besiege jerusalem famine feed upon the city within and war without yet do the jew choose rather to steal forth and trust the doubtful mercy of a enemy then to perish under the cruelty of their own countryman at length such multitude of they get daily through the gate that to be rid of they and fright they from come crucify they all and six the body so put to death round about the city before their wall as a terror to those within so that in the end they press forth for all this continual upon he there can be find neither wood enough for cross to nail they upon nor ground enough whereon to set cross the like misery fall upon this royal kingdom of Barbary for the people in it be strike down so fast by the pestilence that the live be not able to inter the dead neither can there be find ground sufficient enough about their city to afford they burial so that the earth do not as in other country cover and bury they but they bury and cover the earth let we muster the dead together and take a view of this disorder army in Morocco the chief city of Barbary die in one year seven hundred thousand moor and seven thousand seven hundred jew as by bill daily send to the emperor do appear what nation in the world will not have tremble hear of such a invincible host march against they yet death with one arrow slay all these in the city of far die the same yee^e five hundred thousand beside those that fall in the country yea so terrible and fierce be death in his execution of those in Morocco that in the space of one day and a night he slay there with his own hand four thousand seven hundred and odd a merciless and tragical conquest a inglorious victory for he make they away in their bed o what a number of grave must have be open if all these thousand shall have have their rite of burial how many father for child wife for husband son and daughter for parent and kinsfolk for friend shall here have weep if the dead have be pay their due lamentation but mourn here have so waste itself that it quite forget true how to mourn sickness and grief grow so familiar with man that to be rid of such loathsome company they seek out death when they know not where to find a grave o thou beautiful kingdom how can thou choose but look unlovely have so many child dead in thy womb how can thy body be otherwise then unwholesome have so mortal a disease run upon thou yea all over thou seven year together and o your city that be the fair daughter to so noble a mother what shriek and soule-afflicting passion do not you breathe forth see all your merchant that have wont to court you be your love and forsake you to see your building stand in their wont height but rob of their wont ornament to see fox and wild beast instead of man inhabit in your goodly street and meet daily upon your exchange a more than widdow-like lamentation must you needs put one to behold yourselves utter bereave of those that be your best-beloved what kingdom though never so far remove be not heavy at the heart hear these sad story of your sorrow Vlissi your enemy can be so barbarous as not to yield to your condolement we will therefore no long let out your tear withindoore nor no more stand wonder to see all your building show like so many hearse but will survey your fild abroad and try if they can afford any better consolation alas they can calamity there travel up and down in the same wretched habilyment that she wear within the wall city people fly in number up to the mountain to dwell among beast and to dispossess they of their inheritance they fly think death will not follow they but he like a politic general lay so close in ambush at their return back to their city that he cut they off fast than at the first and leave their body to be a pray to those beast who not many day before run into their cave as be afraid of they o what a misery be it to see highway strew with dead and infect carcase as if the whole kingdom have be sack and the enemy have have all the people in execution a rich and abundant harvest cover the face of the earth but the husbandman in stead of fill their barn be busy in fill up grave the fruit which the ground bring forth she herself do again denoure a strange harvest be it for corn be have in without reaper it be gather and sow again all at one time for the earth do now play the good housewife she save all to herself and yet even in save it do she spill all there be not hand enough to gather the food which she out of her plenteous lap bestow among her child nor mouth enough to eat it the country-lasse sit not now sing by her milking-payle for the poor beast run bellow up and down with swolneudder mourn before their master door because they can not be ease of their burden the pestilence have thus like a merciless invader destroy both city and village and have oftentimes make the great lord in the kingdom stoop to his command and determine to conclude his conquest with take the general over so great a nation prisoner do at the last set upon the emperor Mahamet himself and with her venomous breath kill he which glorious victory be get death and his lieutenant sickness begin to sound a retreat to march from their wall and to let they live in quiet no soon be their back turn but again in multitude come the people down from the mountain and as all river when land-water have oppress they fly to the bosom of the sea for safety so do the nation of this great empire from all part thereof come march joyful and yet fearful to fill up and make good again their disinhabited house what story be now tell of lamentable funeral what friend and kinsfolk be miss what sorrow there be for so much acquaintance lose what gladness to meet with any who they hear or doubt be in their grave their city do now look with cheerful countenance street be fill with man house with family every one apply himself to his former labour every merchant to his traffic but behold in the heat of all this sunshine when no wrinkle can be see in the brow of heaven when all be calm and that man lay safe snort on their secure pillow a second storm burst out of the cloud a second and a more fearful God pour another vengeance on the head of this people he send famine to breath upon they and to suck the lifeblood out of their bosom so that they that before dare not come near one another for fear of be infect with the pestilence be now ready to lay hold each of other and to turn their own body into nourishment the plague be merciful to they in dispatch they quick out of the world but this tyrant put they to linger death they have once more meat than mouth now they have many mouth and no meat o hunger how pitiless be thou a monster thou be of a most strange condition for how small a thing will appease thou and yet what will thou not destroy to satisfy thy ravenous appetite thou be most cruel to they that most seek to relieve thou and when thou have nothing to feed upon thou play the murderer and eat up thyself how tyrannous have thou show thyself to this great nation thou have hear child cry for bread to their parent yet will not relieve they whilst the parent go mourn and pine up and down that they want food themselves man that be strong of body do thou by thy sorcery bring so low that they can scarce stand on their leg woman that have fresh blood in their cheek and be lovely to be look upon do thou make leave and turn they into anatomy o famine thou cruel executioner of God wrath thou dishonest guest for into what house soever thou come thou destroy all that be set before thou thou traitor to plenty envious hag malicious witch that with thy unsavoury breath blast whole field of corn away get thou go the hand of heaven keep thou from land upon the english share hide thy head for shame in the grave of those who most unmerciful thou have slaughter be bury there for ever for if thou shall set foot upon this little isle thou will quick turn it into a great land of misery but be the terrible judge of the world satisfy with punish this people twice in this manner have their offence towards he deserve no more blow it seem they have run into a most proud rebellion and that he have swear in his indignation to be revenge upon they for it for lo the spirit of his rage come now in a consume fire it be wrap up in cloud of lightning and the thunder of it break into civil war the three son of so great a emperor shine now like three meteor in the firmament all in steel their court now be camp and none be courtier but soldier three brother be all three king be up in arm only to make of three but one misery upon misery they that escape the stripe of the pestilence be eat to death by famine they that save themselves out of the jaw of famine be now in danger to perish on the Sword o noble France if I shall bid thou only to tell the horror the terror the unbounded mischief and calamity that come march in with intestive broil thou need to say nothing but to open thy bosom and show those deep scar which thy own son have set there there be tear yet in thy eye for those sad funeral which the civil sword prepare the low-countries have be in labour a long time and be not yet deliver of that monster if they can not express the pain and pang that follow this inward disease of a kingdom this grief about the heart of a land this very earthquake that have power to overturn town and tower we have too many leaf in our own chronicle spot with the envenom ink of civil discord too many of our king have be too famous by that misery too many of our noble family have shake their ancient house by that thunder this fire of dissension have now take hold of Barbary a kingdom full of people abundant in riches flow with art and traffic with all nation how happy therefore be we that have peace in our city and plenty in our field yet doubtless our sin be in number infinite in nature abominable we deserve as little pardon as they yet be our wickedness as black and detestable as they let we therefore stray aside awhile and by compare the heavy affliction which the divine justicer have lay upon other country in time past acknowledge a incommensurable love and mercy of he to this island of we now in these present day for in the year of Christ 81. and in the year 188 the breath of the pestilence be so strong and so contagious that in Rome there die daily two thousand people in the year 254 fifteen province of the roman empire be almost consume with the like calamity nay in Constantinople the rage of the disease be so great that in the year 530 there fall every day for many day together five thousand and sometime ten thousand within ten year after that which be in 540 there begin a universal plague over the whole world which continue 50 year with hot violence in the year 1359 so mortal a blow do death give to Italy by infection that there be scarce leave ten of a thousand and to Rome in the year 1521 that she make grave for a hundred thousand Milan likewise padua and Venice in the year 1576 and 77 open the earth to receive into her womb a hundred thousand dead carcase that be leave breathless in each of those city by the tyranny of this pestiferous disease and in Bohemia be but a small kingdom there die three hundred thousand the same time in the year 1596 fall such a plague in Constantinople that it strike down in six month space seven hundred thousand person and this misery be second by so terrible a famine that a penny loaf of bread of english money be worth a crown in gold by reason of which the people be worse consume than before by the pestilence we will now set forth some of our own home-born tragedy wrought by the plague of which take this as prologue to the rest in the reign of k. Edward the three the infection spread itself in the east indies among the tartar saracen and turk which have a hand over they by the space of 7 year and this vengeance which be pour down from heaven upon this people strike their soul into such amazement and terror that many of the heathen with the very fear thereof offer to be convert and turn christian shorthe after by reason of passenger from one province to another the same mortal plague be disperse in many christian kingdom and among other bring into England where it be so forcible all over the land that not only man but also beast bird and fish be smite therewith and find dead with botch upon they yea such a massacre do it make among the live that they be scarceable to bury the dead at which time with the rest that then die of the plague Henry duke of Lancaster Blanch duchess of Lancaster and the earl of Warwick end their life so that in one year in a little plot of ground of 13 acre compass then call spittle-croft and now the charterhouse be bury 50000. person beside all they that be then bury in the church yard and diverse other place our late calamity inflice upon we for our sin be fresh in memory the eye of many people be yet wet with mourn at burial the rod be still hold over we the stripe of it be even now to be see stick in our flesh yet you see how the great father of nation keep we under his wing he be loath to chide more loath to strike we let we not therefore like foolish haire-braind child provoke he too often and too much to anger lest he take up his triple mace of hot vengeance and with it bruise our people as he have already stretch out his arm to smite those of Barbary
