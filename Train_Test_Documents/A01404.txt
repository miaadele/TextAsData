the exemplary history and lamentable dejection of the heart of Tyrone they which write of the basilisck and will seem to dispel the vapour of ignorance with the strong and swift wind of knowledge report that whosoever he look upon die the death but if he be first discover his own venom poison himself whereupon treason be resemble to his eye which of their own nature must needs prevail without prevention but make apparent by some timely intelligence they be break as we say in the shell and strangle in the womb notwithstanding such have be the secret of innovation and disposition of turbulent spirit that they ever have a trick to fly to foreign prince for refuge when their own design be unable to stand upright in the frame of government and although I never read of subject that return to recover his estate or purpose by the mere coadiutement of a foreign king except that king project for himself to make another disloyalty the step to stand more firm upon and raise his own ambition to a great height yet have they not desist to follow the deceit of their own heart and as the jew find a rot reed and break staff of Egypt undertake impossibility to the destruction of infinite thousand and at the best but the save of their own life for a time for although Hadad a Edomite of the king seed flee unto Pharaoh king of Egypt who give he a house land and the sister of his wife even Taphnes the queen whereby it shall seem he thrive in his revolt yet alas be it so far from prejudice of Solomon that he only discover a willingness without power or mean to disturb the state and make the great king stand on his guard the better although flee unto Sisag continue there unto the death of Solomon and so receive as it be supportation in his treason yet it be the revolt of the ten tribe and the curse which brand salomon idolatry make Israel rebel against rehoboam and settle this servant in his master throne although as Herodotus report that Harpagus medus after Astyages have with great immanity murder his son flee unto Cirus into Persia in hope of revenge and so set the east and whole Asia in combustion yet alas he only make havoc of his country and bring a stranger to possess both the monarchy if you overlook the story of Hannibal and will know what entertainment he have with Prusias king of Bithynia you shall find he a miserable spectacle of dejection and that he only open he the door of death scarce afford he leisure to enter before he be deliver into the hand of scorn according to their intention to lead he captive to Rome look upon Pompey misery who flee unto Ptolemy his suppose friend but to what end even to be bring to the house of slaughter for fear of the prevailer what can Cleopatra avail her Anthony or Lepidus Sestus Pompeius and infinite other sufficient shroud themselves under foreign shade when the great cloud be thicken to rain down shewre of devastation upon their head and Octavius hold up his head in the turbulent sea of those civil war and thus can I send you into the wild field of instance especial concern traitor who be all choke with this Machiavellian position of admit the treason but not suborn the traitor do I not purpose to disclaim a uncivil uncover the hoary head of antiquity and divulge this principle that there be no confidence in prince further than the revolt of other may second their own business and the private quarrel of a kingdom weaken themselves for a stranger admission which yet must be do by the faction and coadiutement of the same nation therefore I stand amaze at the fanatical hope of diverse spirit in our nation that in those day rely upon the supportation of Spain and be still confident on the blessing and curse of the pope especial his ridiculous excommunicate of prince now laugh at through the world when they can afford i one example neither domestic nor foreign neither obsolete or modern neither divine nor profane of any subject step awry into the by-way of rebellion or insurrection that be establish by a foreign prince except that prince as I say before project by such a bridge to transport his own power for his own end and private satisfaction but I will fain disclaim any uncivil open the grave of the dead and content myself with display the colour of time not yet elapse from our own memory when the child of that worthy Edmond ironside flee into Hungary from that prevail greatness of Canutus I do not read of their triumphant return nor other establishment against that brave Dane till the faction of England break out into flame of their private revenge when Henry the second have crown his son king of England and that the impatient young man can not endure his own father in the competition the story say the prince with his brother flee into France but how they return how they prosper and how they be support it be lamentable one way to report and remarkable another way to relate in that deplorable business of Edward the second when his wife and son presume on the assistance of the french king I hope it be not that power which establish the young prince but the authority of Mortimer that suppress the mislead king when Henry the four prevail queen Isabel flee to her own brother about the restore of Richard 2. but to what purpose to bemoan her remediless grief and return if ever she do return without supplement of sufficient assistance the earl of Richmond though afterward Henry the seven in the confuse time of the Yorkest prevail go into Britain and so into France but how he have like to have be serve Peter Landoise the secretary and the king gold can then have unveil the corruption of either and when that fortune lead he by the hand to pace out the measure of victory I hope it be no french power but english friend and the justice of divine providence which seat he so happy in the throne of greatness how Perkin Warbeck for all his exhale vapour go forward assist by the scottish policy flemish credulity and malice of the duchess of Burgundy against the house of Lancaster our stage of London have instruct those which can read how the earl of Westmoreland and number of english fugitive have be entertain abroad some overthrow with calamitous desperation some collude with the incantation of friar and religious miracle some distract with guiltiness of conscience some transfound with ambitious prosecution and some prevaricate with a outward glory of military profession all man can discover with repine eye or else let they overlook a well compact breviary to the same purpose discourse of the entertainment of english fugitive beyond the sea in the heat of our enmity with Spain don Antonio king of Portugal fly under the covert of a princely protection which to the admiration of the world so expand itself that we bring he to the gate of Lisbon but be deceive with his presumptuous weakness and over-credulous information somewhat near the same account another personate the king Sebastian suppose slay in the field of Barbary astonish Florence and Venice with many prevail probability of his life but the king of Spain be in the strength of a new possession and the italian too fearful to raise up a spirit they know not how to conjure down again if you will commiserate the misfortune of Stukely I can catalogue all his proceed and relate that the best glory of his entertainment both with the king of Spain and the pope consist in some poor mercenary allowance and when it be at the high to flourish only with the titular dignity of the marquis of dubline but alas it want the essential part and prop of such a business man and treasure so that I may very well conclude against all such exhalation and infatuate man with the significant poet what say you to Antonio de Peres for who the war of Arragon burst forth into the reproach of seditious revolt and tumultuary disobedience be he not a while suffulciate among we until those unlooked for condition of peace hang down the head of many military and noble mind english send he to put his confidence in God for the prince of the world have fail he you have hear how the duchy of Milan be as it be dilacerate with trouble and post over from perplexity to perplexity until the emperor Charles the five make it a meritorious act to secure it under the strength of his protection but alas he quick leave they stagger in their weakness and widen his own embrace to hug they warm for himself and keep they close to the majesty of Spain what say you to the duke Maine and many of that french league how do they excruciate themselves to be shoulder aside from their expectation of foreign coadiutement and when they have labour to hide themselves in the reed of the archduke pool yet be they fain to make themselves clean again by a contrary submission in the spring of their own country assure the malcontent of their combination that no prince will hazard the peace of his country and treasure of his commonwealth for any foreign subject live unless as in many place before the project be contrive for their own glory or benefit I can begin again with the unnatural distraction of the war between Lancaster and York when queen Margaret the virago of her time and her faction flee both into Scotland and France but with what comfort of supportation there and relief at home the catastrophe of her husband and son can delineate her misfortune and her own dismission out of England be a sufficient warning to all disastrous prince especial seditious subject neither to trust their own strength and friend in unjustifiable proceed lest with Phaeton wilfulness they find the sun horse too too headstrong for their manage nor be too confident in the best adversity on the presidiary help of a stranger if once the business tend to draw a army into the field and as it be to pull off the gate of another majesty over the hinge but of all other the history of tirone and Terconell be most lamentable and remarkable who while I be in Italy pass by Milan to Rome but in such a manner as if Zedechias eye be put out and the prince of juda carry captive to Babylon before the monarch of the east for his entertainment with Spain be no better than in a common inn at Milbane with a common trick to grace and flatter he with a foolish title of the prince of Ireland and at Rome he be the subject of charity and have only a poor supplement from some special cardinal yet because I have be a spectator of this flourish tree like the chaldean vision and see his blast and fall of leave as the figtree curse by our saviour give i leave to be behold to Mr cambdens compendious discourse and with some addition of my own set he thus on the stage of fearful admiration thus much by way of introduction the story follow the history of the earl of tirone I will here desist from any dilation of irish business of old or mention of the great oneale who as they say before the come of saint Patrick possess Ulster and most part of Ireland shine as the sun of the same until the conquest from England obscure his light and teach his barbarous immanity another manner of obedience and lesson of submission to a great majesty by which occasion this ambitious family be in a manner suppress and lose that seem lustre where with it grace the north of Ireland yea the whole island lie close to the shore and not dare once to launch forth into the ocean of turbulent dissension or refractory contest with England until Edward de Bruse of Scotland proclaim himself king of Ireland then Dovenaldus oneale impatient of such indignity launch forth by degree into the channel of a new disturbance and hold up his head as presume on his own greatness equal to Bruse and so in his letter and submission to the pope accustom the title of heir of Ireland king of Ulster and one of the son of the mother church but that trouble appease these new king be separate and their unite greatness even in their posterity disjoint until again that implacable contention between the two family of York and Lancaster not only deform the prosperity of England but according to the prevail of factious greatness send over diverse governor their particean into Ireland who still temporize with the strong party and contrive for their private lest the general cause at random and be indeed unable to redact to any uniformity of government the disparity of irish obedience and so give way unto this ambitious insult and rude people to hold up their head and advance themselves as high as their own title the law Tanist and liberty of nature can dignify they whereupon Harry oneale the son of oenus or Eugenius match himself with the daughter of th. earl of Kildare and his son Con more or great Con marry the daughter of Gerald earl of Kildare his own mother niece whereby unite to the flourish colour of the geraldine which many year have be display in Ireland and swell with the fullness of a most uberant family they begin beside a strange elation of their spirit with a tyrannous suppression of their own nation and this con more despise all title of either prince duke marquis or earl in respect of the name of oneale to this Con succeed another con surname banco or lance who inveterate hate against the english be such that he curse his posterity if either they learn the language sow any wheat or build house this man greatness breed he envy in the court of England and according to the misery of all time there want not private whisperer yea flatterer of prince by who suggestion that famous king Henry the eight be jealous of his power especial when it be corroborate by that factious house of Kildare who story alone be of worthy memory and afford so many excellent observation that I wish they fold up as it be in one carpet to be spread abroad with handsomeness for our delight and understanding but when the strength of our army and fortune of the war have both overawe their weakness and reduce to good order those dangerous enemy bring they into the school of correction for their misdemeanour and reformation for their incivility this Con be compel to prostrate himself before the majesty of England and so disclaimnig the title of oneale by letters-patent be create earl of tirone his elder son Matthew though suspect a bastard baron of dunganon and all his family as it be incorporate to the new obedience of the king this Matthew until the age of fifteen year be impute the son of a smith in Dundalk who wife be oneale concubine do at the time of death according to the custom of Ireland present he with this son who oneale do not only receive with gladness but accept he as his own yea prefer he before his other child to his title and possession but johannes or shane oneale his son by a lawful wife take it in such indignity that make a strong faction against his father he not only supplant his brother Matthew cut off his head but torment the old with many unnatural assault and violent excursion depopulate his territory kill his complice banish his auxiliary and at last bring he with untimely grief unto his grave and all the country to be affright with his tyranny for he not only step forward more glorious than his other ancestor proclaim himself the great oneale but with several expedition contract the love and observation of the other province insomuch that many rebel both of Conach meth and Munster assist he in the prosecution of mathews child among who Brian fall into the hand of Maudonel Totan be cruel murder Hugh and Cormach be under english protection and hardy preserve which fall out so cross against Shanes expectation and disastrous to his rebellious presumption that with a loathsome savageness and traitorous conspiracy he deform the beauty of Ireland peace and make havoc in a strange manner of her prosperity to which insolency and violent rage of prevail sir Henry Sidney l. justice of Ireland in the absence of t. earl of Sussex lord lieutenant make opposition and cast such block in the way that his fury be somewhat rebate and a cataplasm of restraint apply and when there be no remedy but cut and fear the ulcerous flesh of this putrefy body of rebellion by force of arm he not only propulse the indignity lash the side of these proud treason with the stripe of a revengeful hand but bring this insult lord on his knee and make he confess the superiority of England majesty but first by way of expostulation the matter be dispute with this shane how he dare presume to cast as it be a defiance into the face of England government and put on his jearean wing to fly high than his own feather will warrant he he answer very peremptory that he be the true and lawful heir of Con oneale as issue from a worthy wife and of a noble house whereas Matthew be the son of a smith in Dondalck and only foist in to overthrow the family of oneale which he neither will nor can be a pathic unto as for the king letter patent afford Con the honour of a coronet and title of earl a cunning way to extenuate his worth and greatness in his country it be apparent that Con have no interest but for term of life nor can without the consent of the lord and Dinastas of Ulster transfer another right into the king hand beside such be the ancient glory of his family that the true heir must be certify by the oath of twelve man which in mathews case fail and therefore be the nullity of they very conspicuous and all such proceed of England against he worthy frustrate but concern himself he have approbation both from God and man as the lawful son of a love wife and be confirm by the law Tanist according to the suffrage of the people and several applause of the family of Ulster and for his since progression he never admit of other thought then to maintain the ancient glory of his unmatchable house nor usurp other jurisdiction than his ancestor by many precedent and apparent record have former exercise and confirm without contradiction and to which the other king of England have gracious consent and most indulgent protect they notwithstanding all this he run a contrary course to former protestation and in the violent race of rebellion plunge himself to his utter extirpation and confusion as by the sequel may appear for first he audacious suppress o Realy and quarrel with Callogh o donel defeat his complice tavish his wife imprison himself and child deva his castle usurp his inheritance and like the king of Ulster indeed proceed with all imperiousness and malicious insult over his inferior but as soon as Thomas earl of Sussex lord lieutenant of Ireland prepare our english force to rebate his pride and reduce the other country he a little moderate his ambitious course and a while procrastinate his former resolution wherein the persuasion of Gerard earl of Kildare his cousin who queen Mary have restore be so effectual that he retire into England and in all suppliant manner abject himself before the council with promise and strange protestation not only of be a true subject but a entertainer of civility and fashionable order both in life and habit the hope whereof dismiss he home again and like a cunning strumpet insinuate with the good opinion of a new deceive friend he begin reasonable well shut his ear against the Syren-like temptation of his bard and rhymer undertake to hear the controversy of his people relieve the want of the distress in a word demean himself with a noble kind of moderation in peace and when there be cause of war expulse the scot of Ulster and cut off the head of james Mac-Connell their captain and principal occasion of that innovation in these sweet passage of peace and quietness he continue a while and the poor churl think he behold a fair shine planet in a perspicuous heaven grow proud of such a alteration that he now may complain of receive injury and obtain redress for unsufferable wrong but the better sort find he over-insolent to endure and misdoubt a project against all their estate and dignity complot to overthrow he suggest matter against he and so order the business that mac-guy lord of fermanagh come in person to sir Henry Sidney by this time lord deputy to implore his assistance for the restrain or if you will suppress this usurp king of the north which shane oneale take so despiteful and apprehend with such indignation that drink with rage he become unsensible of reason and forget his allegiance with all the former fair promise of loyalty he prosecute mac-guy at his return with fire and sword besiege armagh demolish the church destroy the building and come to Dondalk with purpose to ruin the country but be a while intercept by a worthy expedition of sir wil. Sercefield Maior and the citizen of dubline I may add the power of the country and the muster force of the english irish about and Tredagh by this time be the royal arm of the state spread abroad and the lord deputy after he have ship 7. company of foot and a troop of horse for logh-foile under the command of sir ed. Randoll set forward in person towards the north with the rest of the army which when shane have intelligence of as what can be do which some or other make he not acquaint with and that he understand there be a purpose with all advantage to press he both behind and before he raise himself towards the derry and with great expedition bring the matter to decide so that many skirmish be but as it be preparative to that main encounter which to his perpetual renown cost sir ed. Randoll his life and bring shane to confusion for very quick all his purpose be disannul his force weaken his rebel dissipate and the whole strength of his project infringe so that despair to reintegrate his estate he determine a strange alteration o that man dare presume of any thing be subject to such a alteration with a halter about his neck to submit to the deputy but divert from so base a course by the advice and courageous spirit of his secretary he make trial of a new confederacy with Alexander Oge and the scot who be resident and rebellious in the claude boy but first as a introduction of peace he release surleboy the brother of Alexander who he have long detain in prison and thus presume on this new combination with the enforce Odonnels wife and some few other he be welcome into the tent of Alexander and for the present entertain as the very prince of the north or king of Ulster but after extraordinary drink and over-liberal carouse certain unkindness and unfortunate repetition begin between they about his other brother death and the honour of his sister who shane have former marry but despiteful refuse wine overcome reason reason thus entangle be subject to confusion of word word increase rage and rage induce revenge so that Alex Oge and mac. gilaspic his brother take advantage of the time and these occasion which be perform with such inveterate malice and offensive digression that shane be set upon overmaster and with many wound slay that his secretary be cut in piece his wife or rather concubine surprise and the company disperse that the rebel of the north be utter subvert these scot make a way to their admission and pardon and by consequence the peace of Ulster restore this business thus settle and determine a parliament be call in Ireland in which shane oneale with all his follower be proscribe the name of oneale interdict the land and territory of the north or Ulster incorporate to the crown of England and all occasion of innovation remove have not Turlogh Leignogh brother son to Con More oneale assume the title a man of decline age and more quiet than the rest of his name suspect indeed that according to their law tanist either shane oneale son or Hugh baron of Dunganmon may intercept his claim and prevent his right as he suppose which compel he to this audacious enterprise contrary to the edict and prohibition of the same notwithstanding to salve the sore of his suspect loyalty he keep correspondency with we in all his other action and in her majesty service not only encounter odonell but overthrow the scots islander and at last destroy Alexander Oge the murderer of shane oneale all this while Hugh the son of Matthew stand on his guard and live wary sometime under the security of his own faithful follower sometime under the trust of english protection for so in his young time he troop in the street of London with sufficient equipage and orderly respect and sometime as a soldier he command a company of horse under the deputy in Munster against the earl of Desmond with a pension beside of one thousand mark a year out of the exchequer which orderly proceed with the trust conceive of his loyalty draw the bow for he wherewith he hight the mark of his own aim and so by new leters-patent have diverse restraint and reservation he be admit to his grandfather title and inheritance nor shall it seem that Turlogh Leignogh stomach his advancement but rather upon hope of his virtue which give a lustre to his action surrender his title and lordship into his hand but oh the ambition of man or unconstancy of manner these proceed with he in this fair and gentle manner make he either proud of his own greatness or presumptuous that the state be afraid to displease he or superstitious after the priest have insorcer he for present against the queen absolute prohibition this new tirone take upon he the title of oneale excuse the fact lest some rebellious spirit according to their warlike custom of maintain that character in their family may assume the same take advantage of his negligence protest to disclaim the honour so he may not be urge by oath and from hence arise the first motive of unsteadfastness fastness at this instant be that memorable defeat and admirable discomfiture of the king of Spain formidable armado or if you will according to Mendozas own word than embasdor leaguer in Paris invincible navy whereby in their return by Scotland and Ireland many of they perish but the better sort be kind entertain by tirone after the manner of irish hospitality and unexpected welcome consider that any relief to man in distress and cast on a strange shore by shipwreck be as balm and oil pour into wound in requital whereof such a loom of mischief be set on work that at the last the cloth be weave of his corruption and fold together to keep his treason warm in his own bosom till a strong suppose and yet presumptuous hand spread it abroad to his utter destruction and shameful disgrace by reason of his deform filthiness for when then these straggle spaniard perceive his natural inclination to ambitious willingness concern the maintain some turbulent faction in Ireland and demonstration of a stir spirit for the glory of his ancestor they quick add fuel to the fire and with all the bait of prosperity and incantation to flattery choke his loyalty and cast dust into the eye of his faithfulness some promise that their great master shall recompense his humanity and noble respect some repine at their misfortune lay many slander on the shoulder of our country some under colour of religious obedience assure that the pope himself shall gratify he some more dangerous cunning creep within he by that imposture art of commendation infer he be more worthy of a crown than a subject prostitution and some more plain with demonstrative reason lead he as it be by the hand to the chair of presumption and possibility that it may be so if he dare attend his own fortune and prosecute the time in their several change by which occasion this man irresolute love to his prince and country be first envenom and taint afterward it rankle more and more in his decline from himself and first soundness by contract a league with Spain three it swell apace with the oath and allegiance of many follower and partician to coadiute he in any enterprise whatsoever and last of all it restre incurable in consent and put the same in practice to be a opposite to the government of England and a famous rebel against the peace of our country which yet be neither so cautelous dispose of nor firm compact but Hugh ne gauclock his brother fear the fearful consequence of the downfall of his house discover the same for which the earl find a time to strangle he colourable prosecute the actor that dare lay hand on any of the blood of oneale but alas it serve not his turn for not only this barbarous fratricide but all his other refractory course be lay open to the peer eye of England majesty but such be his prevail fortune that upon his reasonable justification and seem penitency our gracious Elizabeth not only remit those offence with favour but continue he in his greatness with honour in this manner he move awhile in the high orb of prosperity and from our english supportation command his country as a prince of the north and except a open display of the colour of rebellion perform what he dare and dare do any thing which tend not to manifest treason and dangerous innovation for not long after under colour of corroborate the peace of his country and insinuation with some english affinity he make sir Samuel bagnol sister believe that the great oneale of Ireland be captivate to her love and in which if the time can have serve he will have show himself as brave and complete a amorist as the formall courtier in England to this the lady seem no great opposite only with some show of modesty depend on her brother she refer the success to his approbation who some what too stubborn interpose as it be a negative not without exprobration of the barbarous custom of the north of Ireland which tirone interpret disgracious to his exaltation and find no other remedy to appease his wilfulness in a manner by force of arm take she to his wife whereupon he be deny her dowry and that exasperate his displeasure to which when the deputy add the suppress of Mac Mahond his neighbour I be afraid it exulcerate his loyalty for when he perceive he be forbid the title to the abase of his family and see his inheritance distribute to the impoverish his estate he quick startle up and many displeasure discover themselves against his former establishment so that the earl by occasion of reckless booke-keeper cast up his untoward account in this manner first that the state have a purpose to suppress the flourish eminence both of himself and all the lord of the north next that they shall be compel to alter their religion and disclaim the pope usurp authority over the church three that the martial sir Henry bagnol have not only prosecute he with despiteful and malignant enmity but justify article of treason against he four that he be deny the fruit of his own labour and honour of his industry after he have as he object with the loss of much blood and expend of great treasure of his own reduct the province of Ulster and last of all that sir William Fitz-William lord deputy have not only give way to the malice of the marshal but possess the court of England with many untruth against he all which be quick capitulate to the of the north his kinsman favourite and dependent and they as quick commiserate his discontent and mere out of inveterate hate against we all contract themselves to the maintain the romish religion and obedience to the house of oneale keep yet a open correspondency with we though in covert their heart as the lapwing cry far from her nest store up as it be all provocation of disloyalty lie yet in wait for some advantageous excuse if they once be discover the first that break the ice of their ill contrive rebellion be Mac Guier a turbulent young man crafty and revengeful who seduce by Gauranus a priest confirm primate of Ireland by the pope invade Conagh and in insult manner usurp the country as he go with full confidence that the holy father blessing shall in a manner make security and success attend they but the door of heaven be bar on the inside exclude they as yet from any entrance and the virtue of sir Richard bingham so countercheck Mac Guiers fortune that he flee discomfit the primate slay and all his force disperse yet after a while the scatter limb of Pelops be gather together and as if Anteus shall recover by touch the earth Mac Guier make a strong party and with some deceivable beginning go into more open action against who the earl of Tyrone himself be compel to join with the marshal his only suspect enemy and receive a wound in that service but his heart as it shall seem be worser hurt with private discontentment for you must understand that before he set forward in her majesty service order be take for the safe keep of shane oneale child who delivery he have deny to the state infer by way of complaint that the lord deputy and Martial pick nothing but quarrel against he and by new occsiaon of unkindness determine to supplant he now be sir William fitzwilliam recall and sir William Russell constitute deputy in his stead to who of his own accord the earl of Tyrone come to submit himself with all those promise that may induce a generous spirit to believe he but the marshal bagnol then present audacious articulate 1 that he countenance Mac Guier and the primate rebellion 2 that he support odonell and the rest of that conjuration 3 that by the advice of Cormach Mac baron his bastard son Con have coadiutement from he in the devastation of monaghan and besiege of Inigkellin 4 that he corrupt the faith and obedience of the captain of Kilulto and Kilwarney 5 and that all his protestation be counterfeit and dissimulatory fiction these be heinous objection and indeed divide the council for the deputy and Martial will have detain he prisoner but the great part either by vain fear or corrupt respect intercede until a more fit opportunity to who as man better acquaint with the affair of Ireland the lord deputy hardly condescend so Tyrone return home and indeed turn as the dog to his vomit to his former impress resolution to disturb the state if the state disturb he whereupon understand of a army raise in England with new supply of

Low-countries soldier against he who that worthy and renown sir John Norris by the famous name of general Norris bring out of Britain he not only stand on his guard but muster his follower by this time reasonable discipline in the open field and whilst the english go against Balishanon and belike castle at the further end of Logh Erne he approach Black-water fort and come on the sudden have it surrender into his hand but not with that confidence that either he rely on the security of the place or power of his own army whereupon he very politic one way attempt the earl of Kildare to support he against the manifest injury of the deputy and Martial and another way promise the earl of ormond and sir Henry wallop treasurer to remain within the limit of justifiable obedience to this he add the unclasp the book of these occurrence to sir John Norris general of the army implore his commiseration and as it be beg at his hand that he may not be enforce to such exorbitant action as necessity and the law of nature will and can contrive but the former letter the marshal intercept and these too general Norris quite suppress which he spare mislike though it fall not to his turn absolute to find fault withal but when Tyrone understand of these calumnious and dangerous proceed against he he be put quite out of patience exclaim that his destruction be now on the web and in the hand of a pestilent workman yea his adversary want only mean to his will to contrive his utter destruction indeed notwithstanding all this he put on new wing to his deceivable hope and turmoil all the kingdom with inficious rebellion whereupon he be public proclaim traitor and enemy to the queen which he profess according with all correspondency of a adversary for in Ulster his army consist of a 1000 horse and 7000. foot in Conach he have or if you will o Roorck and the conners keep they together at his dispose 200. horse and 2400. foot in lease and Ophaly the number be as uncertain as their disposition be sometime violent rebel and anon submissive subject in Munster they live so disperse that the governor find it work enough to find they out and follow they the english force under sir John Norris equal their great army but nothing be do worthy of so great a commander name and soldier renown for under colour of private displeasure between the deputy and he many bad office be perform and the time spend to small purpose in parley and conference afford tirone such leisure that he contract with Spain and expect from thence continual supply but before the matter come to martial decide sir Henry wallop treasurer at war and sir Robert Gardner chief justice of the king bench man lay down in the balance of integrity wisdom and experience be delegate to hear the grievance of these great lord of the north enforce to a defensive war as they intimate and yet obscure by the name of traitor against the state the commiserate hear of these compulsion and unquiet discourse from so dangerous a faction return our english commissioner with some amazement at their oratory and cunning insinuation whereby they may have excuse diverse thing if by a wrong course they have not incur the danger of contest with prince yea their royal sovereign who incense majesty can not endure such opposition whereupon the truce be overpass and the trumpet of defiance sound through the kingdom foreshow that the schoolmaster of reformation be at hand and sir John Norris as lord general of the army in the absence of the deputy ready to display the colour of correction but it shall seem the deputy will needs have a share in the glory of this business for contrary to his first appointment he haste apace and unite his troop with sir John Norris and so both together attend the success of the matter and prosperity of the time the beginning be a fortunate terrify he at armagh and press he so close that the earl leave Black-water fort dismantle the town thereabouts fire some house at Dungannon his own principal seat and secure himself in his chief fastness win much time by this politic retreat but we unexperienced in those dangerous place of his bog and wood with only proclaim he traitor in his country and leave garrison in armagh return which tirone audacious interpret to his own advantage repine at nothing more than our fortification in monaghan thus be our business keep awhile out of the run current of applause for the deputy and the general of the army grow to some impatient contradict one another as if there have be a fault commit which be questionless to be impose on one of their shoulder wherefore the deputy command or if you will wish s. i. Norris to prosecute the service in Ulster whilst he retire to dubline to provide for the peace of the other province but it prevail little to the lift up the head of the main body for he perform nothing worthy the glory of his former reputation or dignity of so eminent a place but whether the emulation of the deputy or favour the earl to who he be as much incline with respect as the deputy transport with hate or whether he suspect the business in hand the nature whereof with the baseness and intricate obscurity of the country be so contrarious to the military proceed elsewhere and spend all man spirit without so much as the memory of manhood or whether in inclination of fortune he begin to stagger from his first firmness which in a customary defect deal strange with such commander sometime heap her favour and prosperous success anon again withdraw her happy hand and by degree extenuate both their valour fame and judgement I dispute not upon only this I be sure of that fair error may lead they both for the deputy by reason of sir Henry Bagnol and some other despite be bring to look upon a very face of disloyalty in tirone and sir John Norris commiserate his misfortune as abuse with dissimulatory submissive letter in which the earl be ready on his knee to any penitent prostitution when yet underhand he implore the aid of Spain with warrantise that if a army be intend against England then to unite their force if only war be proclaim and protraction use then must the catholic king supply they with man and money whereupon Roorck Mac Williams and other open and the earl private subscribe to a certain instrument of indenture like ratification give yet notice to the state of all these contract and determination to which be add another parley with sir John Norris and sir Geoffrey Fenton secretary in person full of very strange promise and collude protestation to run a race of obedience and loyalty all which accustom levity he infringe lay imputation upon the discrepant humour of the deputy and lord general but especial that his only enemy the marshal be return from England with new force and inveterate malice against he whereupon by way of apology he excuse himself to the council of England and urge many justifiable reason as he think for his discrepant proceed to which it shall seem their answer be both distaste and fearful unto he for as it be exasperate rather then forewarn he present return to his old course and take great advantage of our slackness and ill prepare force spoil the country fill all the pace with rebel barrocade the passage and with military excursion run a uncontrollable journey of do what he please through the north. thus be all Ulster and most part of Conach except certain garrison at his absolute command until the lord Borough 1597. a man of a great spirit and quick capacity be send deputy into Ireland from who worth some auspicious expectation seem to comfort we and new endeavour in a manner to warrant new fortune this son of Mars quick pull off the clog of delay and within two month roll the stone of unquietness make way with great industry and virtue into his country fortify the fort of Black-water and discover this secret that neither his boggs glinn wood mountain pace confederate or any power of Ireland or irish coadjutor can hide he from the search eye of England beside if we will undertake a industrious prosecution against he it be neither Spain with her gold nor the pope with his fulmination against our country can secure he for the far reach arm of our people will for a need pull he out of the centre of the earth and thus according even at the first skirmish be his force dissipate and the best troop disrank but as my lord be give God thanks with a warlike solemnity a sudden alarm set they anew to work and Henry earl of Kildare with the gent. volentier have the fortune to put he again to flight which yet yield not so full a satisfaction as it may have do because my lord lose his brother in law Francis Vaughan and captain Turner sergeant mayor beside the earl of Kildare to the sorrow of his heart see two of his brother wrap up in the bed of blood all man of worthy expectation and extraordinary merit thus be a way make into his country and Black-water fort strengthen with new trench not without some rampart and Caffamates which the enemy so repine at that between hope fear and shame they resolve to dismantle it have not the lord deputy open more large embrace and with a new manner of wrestle resolve to lay he on the ground irrecoverable but as he be tread the measure of prosperity a untimely discord of death sound music deceive he of hope and we of he who forwardness and virtue with a little addition of experience and solid understanding himself have no doubt effectuate this herculian labour of Ireland peace now be Tyrone put on his icarean wing and the rebel with accustom clamour take advantage of this interim assault Black-water fort but therein command that industrious captain th. Williams who at the same instant by mere valour and resolution propulse they and many time after by patience and constancy endure all those mischief where by a soldier be put to the test and enemy make demonstration of his hate and policy for when the irish find themselves uncapable of such a business by way of expugnation or assault they take another course by intercept the passage to famish they which when the english understand they be as resolute to affront all mischance as the enemy be violent in contrive displeasure and so with noble steadfastness bear up a head against the stream of sickness and want eat horse and weed and if it have be possible the very dirt and stone in this time the government of Ireland be in the hand of the earl of ormond as lieutenant general of the army the lord chancellor and sir Robert Gardner justice to who the earl of Tyrone by many dilatory letter do lay open all his grievance touch spare his breach of promise with sir John Norris and all the effectual point of his disobedience and refractory course to these letter he receive answer which he interpret displease rather then satisfactory and so according enter into further rebellious action press Black-water fort again with a more dangerous siege against who the lord lieutenant and justice aforesaid send sir Henry bagnol the marshal his only repute adversary with sixteen company of foot and four troop of horse who advance forward more malicious than fortunate as overwrought by a predestinate wilfulness come to blow and according to the slippery foot of war fall to a dangerous Skirmish in which Tyrone shoulder he with all his strength nigh unto armagh determine as it be to punish his envy and suppose abuse against he wherein it shall seem the mistress of success as we abuse God providence by the character of fortune be and display all the malign circumstance of revenge against we for ere night decide the controversy he triumph with a notorious victory whereby in one hour the marshal end his bravery life and enmity nor can the irish ever boast of a more conspicuous triumph since the conquest or if you have rather have it so since we first curb their immanity for we lose fifteen captain and 1500. soldier over who the manner of insult be more barbarous than the accident tyrannous present follow the surrender of Black-water fort when the besiege see all relief debar they and hear how Tyrone be proclaim the deliverer of his country and protector of the catholic cause seem the very darling of prosperity and delight of Bellona wherein he proceed according make all the kingdom witness his glory and renown for he present send Ouny-Mac roory Oge and Tirrill into Munster with four thousand rebel against who the lord precedent sir John Norris have lose his brother by sickness or as some suppose a disastrous melancholy with reasonable equipage and orderly attendance set noble forward but the enemy not appear he retire to Corck and divide his army into several garrison give they liberty to take advantage of our wearisomeness and impatience for present they proceed to all hateful course of savage outrage and after james Fitz-Thomas a rebel of that house be proclaim earl of Desmond who thereupon acknowledge oneale his benefactor and superior they return with ambitious alacrity and cheerfulness and send word into Spain of their admirable success wherein Tyrone behave himself so audacious that he interdict the peace of England as if there have be a way open unto a easy conquest of the same and the first step into Ireland will help they up the degree of a more illustrious glory to which purpose the king of Spain shall not only be assure of the pope blessing but oneale fortune and assistance yea the whole power of the kingdom this be the lamentable estate of Ireland when her majesty take pity of her orphan country substitute Robert earl of Essex who the success of Cales voyage and many other memorable design and prosecution have worthy renown her lieutenant general of Ireland but how he have former wound himself into the good opinion of his country how England look upon he as a glorious son of comeliness and honour how his force treasure and favour be extraordinary in this project of Ireland how he proceed in this military race how the applause of the people and the great part of the nobility attend he how a sudden storm as if some ominous sign from heaven presage misfortune intercept his jollity even at his first set out of London how land in Ireland he begin his business as preposterous how that brave sir Coniers Clifford be abuse by presumption and over-credulous opinion that his bosom friend o Roorck will not have prove such a traitor and so not only lose his life at the curlews a boggy mountain by the abbey of Aborle but be inhumane after the skirmish mangle and with great immanity cut in piece how the earl of ormond and sir Henry Harington be surprise and take prisoner by Harry Oge Owny mac roory and the son of Feff mac-Heugh rebel unite against the peace and flourish prosperity of Lemster how he come to a private parley with Tyrone and be much affect by the irish how her majesty rebuke he and from incense indignation challenge both his loyalty and the wisdom of the council of Ireland for a contrarious and untoward method of government and prosecution in the north how his glorious celebrate the feast of saint George in the city of dubline consider the time and turmoil of the kingdom be impute rather a ostentous bravery than a necessary honour how contrary to expectation he come into England after a private prohibition by her majesty own letter how he be command to his own house and his office dispense withal how his sorrow multiply how the people love increase either from a general commiserate of such man in distress or particular apprehension of his greatness and worth how his fortune and life end I will leave to a story of itself yea if I may say so to many story in which such infinite observation may be fold that if a man dare or may spread they abroad all the passage shall be lay open and expose to public overlook of the favour and disfavour of prince the danger of man insatiable of glory the condition of counsellor emulous of one another greatness the mutability and inconstancy of popularity the peril wherein man plunge themselves that dare presume to perpetrate unjustifiable action and the misery which a untimely death bring to a man project high matter to himself but to our irish business again when my lord of Essex trouble be publish abroad and divulge in Ireland the earl of tirone with great indignation break the truce of his country raise his force muster his rebel rumour the invasion of England by Spain and audacious set open all the passage of war and defiance whereupon the traitor increase both in pride and number and those which be mere irish expect their pristinate liberty such again as have settle their estate either by purchase or gift of the prince begin to misdoubt themselves when they perceive such a confluence and concurrence of tumultuary business to the detriment of the kingdom yea I be afraid they be without all hope in their heart when tirone proclaim himself protector of Ireland and maintainer of the catholic religion nor be this only titular and a formal trick of vain promise and flatter friend for he proceed according imperious manage all affair under his government the rebellious he moderate the weak support the strong confirm the stagger reduce the wilful punish and in a word apply himself altogether to the extirpation of the english whereunto he be animate by assure intelligence of preparation in Spain and the receive a competent treasure from thence nor want there certain indulgence and promise from the pope to set his desire on a blaze but when for a present he have receive a hollow phoenix plume with Ixion that boast of lie with juno be yet deceive with the shape of a cloud he presage good fortune and run away with full confidence of success and the rather because he remember how Urban the three have send king John a crown of peacock feather at his designation for the lordship of Ireland thus march he over the country with extraordinary prevail and unaccustomed pomp for a irish commander with new publication of his regardable proceed and princely confirmation and to add fuel to that fire which in his absence be kindle in Munster he go thither in person and under colour of visit a piece of the cross of Christ in Tiperary attempt further send mac-guior to forage the country who chance on Sr. Warrham Sellinger fall to blow and in gallant encounter charge one another so brave that with their staff they equal receive their death wound through their body which a while curb headstrongness and peradventure be cause of his soon retire home after he have celebrate mac-guiors exequy but in truth the advertisement of the earl of ormonds come against he with all the english force rebate his first forwardness and make he suspect all be not so well as he wish but yet animate by many superstitious presage and give all credit to his bard and rhymer of which sort of people especial if I add the priest I will be bold to say thus much that they be the very bane and confusion of Ireland live in such obscenity and filthiness that no gentlewoman think herself happy without they and suppose it no disgrace even to be prostitute unto they insomuch that ill custom beside the intolerable yoke of superstition to which these people be out of measure addict have get the upperhand these insorcering wretch at marriage feast birth of child contract burial and peradventure all their life time challenge certain privilege immunity and gift yea privacy with the woman and imperious overrule the man so that as their family increase in mightiness these damnable creature prosper in reputation as if all blessing depend upon their incantation and prayer and no action can thrive without their cross and sanctify so that in my conscience the most of the rebel and strumpet among they be the bastard of these rogue and vagabond and all the treason which have turmoil our nation have receive life and original from their imposture and persuasion by this time be Sr. Charles blunt lord Montioy confirm deputy of Ireland on who long since the queen have look with respect for the same purpose but the earl of Essex propose to himself the manage of all military affair somewhat covert impugn the same extenuate his experience in the war and that he only have a view of some skirmish in the low country beside his spirit be not stir enough to curb such a nation as give over much to his book and a kind of retire melancholy rather fit for civil government then violent hurly-burly all which wipe not yet out the print of her good opinion but she go forward in her choice and make the election more notable because her own judgement afford sufficient reason of his merit only she propose before he by way of caution my lord of Essex wilfulness and in a manner presumption practise diverse thing against her like and prescription and so alike restrain his commission and by word of mouth command his charines and wisdom concern the knight of man which must needs be vilipend bring once to a community as for any hindrance by the malevolent aspect of single counsellor she promise on her princely word that she will be the queen of her kingdom and no man shall contract a brow of mislike or prevail in any secret information against he whereupon he be much comfort and well hope that that enmity which be whisper between Mr. secretary and he I mean Sr. Robert Cecil may be easy reconcile and as it be like the sweat of a man brow wipe away with a gentle hand which according come to pass for when certain honest man perform good office between they never man observe such a counsellor of state better than my lord do he nor such a greatness honour a person in such a eminent place than Mr. secretary do my lord so that to their die day their friendship be indissoluble and as they love one another so both respect the glory of their country before one another thus without any public ostentation or great attendancy in the month of February 1600. he take his journey towards Ireland and be welcome to our true-hearted english as you see a famous physician present to a sick patient who have long expect his come for he find Ireland so desperate languish that he rather fear her funeral then recovery which must be so at this instant consider the very best do droop with despair and the worst insult with pride Tyrone pass and repass without control and the rebel have nothing in his mouth but the spanish invasion and that Tyrone shall be the prince of their country under the catholic king whereupon to exasperate the new deputy and terrify he at the first they give a assault to the suburb of Dublin and the alarm ring even to the castle where my lord be resident which indeed so much incense he that he resolve to intercept his return out of Munster whatsoever chance and so gather together the rest of the disperse force and take along such gentleman as come with he out of England he march into fereall for you must consider the main army be with my lord of ormond in Munster and determine to see the manner of tyrones return home into his country but be prevent by the admirable expedition he make for certify of all our proceed not without some ampliation of my lord power and authority as in all such case it happen that new governor be not only extol but a army of a thousand by poll shall be make two thousand by report he quick procure a shelter for the storm which be threaten and even ready to pour upon he and so take the way of lease and the skirt of meath post into the north. when my lord deputy be thus frustrate of his expectation he return to Dublin and after orderly consultation conclude to send force by sea to logh-foile and Balishanon as also to Logh-Erne to visit lease and Ophaly to restore Munster and fortify Conach which as they be design of wonderful consequence so must as wonderful wisdom of man and providence of God effectuate the same and bring to a happy period thus be all Ireland like a turbulent sea full of billow even to the very shore and the rebel vex both country and inhabitant the country be spoil overrun and in most part depopulate insomuch that in diverse place twenty mile together not so much as a bird appear the inhabitant be slay ravish enforce and rob insomuch that neither house nor church except some few castle and town in special man hand remain upright but be burn ruin and devast when my lord deputy to make my first hold correspondency feel the pulse so strong of this disquiet body and understand the state of the same by outward and inward demostration his principal care be to reduce the distemperature and cool the heat if it be possible of this burn fever for which purpose he confer with the council and after orderly and provident furnish his army with munition garon and several provision he determine in person and with all speediness sometime the only strength and life of all difficult enterprise to encounter the enemy but especial to divert Tyrone from intercept Sr. Henry Dockeray at logh-foile and Sr. Matthew Morgan at Balishanon whereupon in the begin of May a early time to bring a army into the field he march towards Ulster and press the rebel with so many skirmish that they be wonderful disperse and against all expectation confound thus have he leisure in the midst of june to march back again into lease the only refuge of the rebel of lemster where with admirable success he prevail against that turbulent cruel and bloody young man ony-mac-roory-oge the chief of the family of o-more who have so late disturb the peace of all Munster to who with other his most pestilent and impious confederate do our deputy read a lesson of justice and teach rebellion other principle of conformity then either they be willing to learn or have be before orderly instruct in by which occasion Bellona begin to give we better entertainment and already there appear a decline of the other prosperity thus be the god of battle propitious unto we and the sun of comfort by degree chase away the foggy mist of despair and despite so that every man heart be cheer and they which hold down their head full low in the time of mistrust and affliction I mean the irish-english themselves in the pale begin to stand upright for joy and flock to the court in troop to welcome my lord deputy home and applaud the prosperity of his attempt yea to speak without flattery to impute the happiness to his virtue and wisdom in the midst of this jollity new supply out of England give more air to success which have be so long smother between malignant circumstance of time and ill condition of man devote to private end for this be most certain that in the uncertainty of our prevail when the government of Ireland seem lay at the stake however the better sort keep correspondency with we and profess a kind of glory in participate with our misfortune yet do they underhand not only relieve Tyrone but contract for their own security if any alteration shall chance yea in some of our extremity they behave themselves so audacious and yet with a untoward policy that when they be send for to march with the army they make dilatory excuse and many time deny such attendance as if they have business sufficient to keep their own territory from robbery and spoil but our worthy deputy again with these new troop he undertake the journey of the moiry three mile beyond Dondalk and attempt a impetuous assault which continue with many dangerous and violent skirmish for his horse be shoot under he his secretary slay by he his friend wound and diverse commander hurt yet he endure all and the god of heaven endure he so that at the last with a memorable slaughter and fortunate victory he enforce they from his fastness present find sweet beginning to breath life into action he march to armagh and tumble those hindrance on to side which have make that passage so noisome and because he will maintain a old position he build a fort call mount Norris within eight mile of the newry and in a manner the midway to armagh in honour of that worthy general under who he be introduct on the martial theatre in his return pass over many light skirmish near unto carlingford he prevail with a memorable defeature of the rest and so store the castle with strong ward make the narrow water passable and send the pestilent kern lurk in every corner to seek for better shelter for these new and terrible storm have shatter their old covert and almost beat they to piece over their head not long after in the midst of winter he coast into the glin by Dublin where donnell-spaniah-phelin and raymond-mac-feugh with that pestilent rabble of o-toole hold such a quarter that no man before he have either leisure to disrank they or sufficient force to raise they from their firmness these yet he subdue reduce and lead they by strong hand to such a way of obedience that sir Henry Harrington under he go quiet to Newcastle and have the principal command over they yea I can assure you be glad to be invite to the pleasure of his peace and entertainment and raymond-mac-feugh as I take it be his tenant for Baltinglas and glory in nothing more then that he have swear himself a true subject to the majesty of England last he haste into feriall where the rebel tirrell be pull out of his dark corner into the open light of discomfiture and in the end compel into Ulster to the great commander of their facinorous enterprise whither his lordship follow with admiration and prevail with all the advantage of a fortunate captain for in truth he attempt nothing but prevail and with the centurion in the gospel say to this man go and he go to that do this and he do it so that if a man will then have catalogue his particular he may thus have set down the item of his account which I be the bold to do because I can incur the imputation of flattery not a man remain that I know to reward i nor will not obscure the worthiness of virtue in a general so complete and well assist by all the property of honour and renown first then yet I do not presume of order nor tie myself to the strictness of time he conquer the feriall by the death of the two son of Euer-Mac-Codey he subdue the rebel of the fuse and receive to grace Turlogh-Mac-Henry he lay open the Breny and teach we a way to march over their bog yea to bring our cannon over their deep mire as myself be a eyewitness in Conagh before o-kellies own castle he restore Tredagh and make those unconstant people ashamed of their willingness to become hispaniolize he reduce leiale pardon magennis that usurp there and set open their proud fastness yea their pace and mountain be make easy in despite of nature difficulty and man policy he take to mercy mac-mahond and the o-realies knight that old Sr. Patrick O-Hanland and corroborate all their love as far as he go he expel the rebel from armagh fortify the same with english and come to blackwater Sconce where tirone be very cunning encamp but and he remove he in despite cast up more sufficient trench and leave it once again in the fast hold arm of captain Th: Williams he make lease and Ophaly proud of their peace and prosperity so that the inhabitant still gather themselves under the covert of english protection he set open the glin and make the bren and tool with other inficious rebel ashamed to put any confidence in device or reach of man brain for God have ordain the pride of life to be subject to alteration and the presumption of man to be patible of countercheck to conclude in a word however other man be vertue-worthy and valiant enough yet this our lord Montioy be questionless more fortunate as we be sensible of that term than any man since Sr. Henry Sidney time yet I may not overpass that memorable lord Grey who noble spirit seem to fly in the face of his enemy and dim the sight of the spaniard in Smirwick and other place of Ireland who have in those time a determination to pry into every corner of the country and settle the authority of their great master among we if it be possible thus fortune ashamed of her first churlish entertainment welcome he to the pleasure of a more convenient lodging and give we all hope of his perpetuity in the palace of reputation which in that manner as you have hear he take possession of tirone notwithstanding be not altogether exanimate for what he can not with the lion her perform with the fox skin and according to a old filthy principle he care not what course he take or track he pace in so England may be disturb and his own fortune and greatness maintain whereupon as in many place you have hear he tamper with Spain for the corroborate his power and employ many agent who bring the pope letter to the same purpose effect thus much that money be send he as a preparation and money shall follow as a full purgation of the disease of his discontentment which make he stand the more remote from reconciliation and vilipend my lord deputy as the substitute of England who yet he honour and admire as the indefatigable servant of honour which I must needs use because however jolly spirit view only city muster cry out yet in the worthiness of fearful employment be this a occupation beyond report and no labourer pioneer or artificer in any mechanic trade do ever take such pain as my lord but I may well say with the poet for among other virtue in a general patience and perseverance be the true touchstone of the currantness of the rest now because fortune will needs search he thorough to make trial of his constancy or to increase his glory the certainty of the spaniard land in Munster and only life of whole action tax he with further business and fix all the eye of the kingdom both honest and irresolute upon his proceed herein and hopeful success to prevail unexpected but how in this negotiation a Spaniard design by the pope to be archbishop of Dublin the bishop of Clenfart the bishop of killalow and Arthur a jesuite with Owen be employ how the land at carlingford or some port of the north only advantageous to the project of the conquest of the whole kingdom be propose most befit this purpose how don John de Aquila Zerigo and 6000. soldier attempt this invasion the first take kinsale by composition the other fortify Beerhauen castlehaven and baltimore how they send away their own ship either fear our surprise or assure their company there be no mean of escape or retire back again how all Ireland be amaze and those which wish we well in their heart be yet confound with the report of Spain overprize greatness how we thicken ourselves into a cloud of opposition by gather all the airy vapour of our force or at least so many as may be spare to make the storm the great how we encamp before kinsale and at one time when Sr. George Cary lord governor of Munster be appoint to intercept or if you will to overview passage come forward with great jollity to join with these spaniard be not so many in our trench without as the enemy number in kinsale within how at last tirone tirone I say with 6000. foot and 600. horse come forward within the view of our camp to unite their force together and exasperate our displeasure with many outcry and branado how Sr. Henry Davers general of our horse make a gallant sally against he till according to their accustom shuffle they retire into a wood how the queen ship block up the haven at kinsale and sir Richard Luson in person assault Zerigo and 2000 spaniard stuff in the several castle and harbour of Beerhauen castlehaven and baltimore as former recite and batter the wall so forcible from his ship the haven lie so commodious for the purpose that the enemy wonder at his worthiness and think that their lady of heaven be willing to affect we on earth however fourteen several sally and skirmish to block up our cannon and defeat our approach impetuous drive we to encounter on Christmas even a most memorable victory chance on our side how for many day together it lighten and thunder according as if the stone from heaven shall fall on sisera head on our behalf how that worthy earl of Clenricard be knight only of all the army before the wall of kinsale when the spaniard colour former surprise be flourish as a token of thanksgiving for so prosperous success how my lord of Tomond and many worthy gentleman of his country lie close unto the town and in our last approach sue for the honour-poynt as we term it to assault the same after the battery how the Spaniard on the newyear day follow send their drum mayor to entreat a parley and afterward grow to a composition how at last they depart and be ship by we under the overlook of captain Cotes who set safe on shore don John de Aquila and the rest at the groin how the irish retire disperse themselves into their several fastness and covert I will not here enlarge because you have many discourse and a journal write to the same purpose you shall only now be certify what this angry jonas do after his gourd be wither and how with other of that sort he drench himself in the whirlpool of confusion when his spanish prop be shrink or bladder take away his first retreat be into such country and to such person as he be sure of relief both from the nature of charity and commiseration and the bond of duty and former gratuity from whence with some ado because his soldier be rather man look after a prey then subject to the disaster of a defeat he get home again with little interception of our side the army as yet resident at corcke or thereabouts but when he come to Dungannon the wall seem to weep for his disaster that well hope to have be new colour with the trophy of his rebellion my lord deputy return to Dublin and as it be requisite and most necessary celebrate St. George feast and by way of thanksgiving welcome all the gentleman of the pale who dare not but give God the praise and he the renown of the victory by which Occasion proceed have no such coverture but they all as it be in a glass see the change and alteration of fortune make this use thereof that there be no confidence in worldly prosperity nor must a man be too much elate though terrestrial blessing seem to make his cup to overflow for the man that of late proclaim himself protector of the ancient liberty of Ireland and defender of the romish religion that for the same purpose lead whole army into the field and display the colour of a most dangerous innovation that post and repo through the kingdom at his pleasure as if majesty mean to kiss he in the chair of success that be glorious in the eye of his own people famous to other nation and a very terror to the english inhabitant of Ireland that be coadiut with the purse navy countenance and a army of six thousand well appoint soldier from a mighty prince that be embolden with the love and admiration of his own follower that take advantage of our first slack proceed to debilitate his insolence and that promise himself the very harbour of felicity as be in the high way of establishment be now subject to distress and bow under the burden of mischance and untoward alteration for my lord deputy present follow he into his own country and as I remember the bravery of Charles the five upon his writing of when the west indies be discover where as before the great Hercules have set up his pillar at Gades in Spain with this inscription so may I apply it unto this our general who come now to blackwater fort cry whereas before none of our deputy can ever step three mile beyond but Montioy mount with joy even to the wall of dung^nnon and pitch his tent in the field of tirone expel the great rebel from his own house and take possession of the same and all the territory for the use of the queen his mistress and although in a perilous encounter by the lough attempt to sapp the strong castle of the same well store with rebel he lose that valiant kinsman of his Sr. John Barkley sergeant mayor of who worthiness one of the star of our country George earl of Cumberland have good experience in his voyage to St. port yet apprehend the chance of war and condition of mortality he be no whit affright or trouble but rather exasperate to revenge whereupon he set fire of their cabin and town enter the very castle of Dungannon rifle the same and although he be wrong with a strange report of obtain great treasure yet I believe he bring home one little guilt basin and ewer of silver a mad tip with silver and guilt and some rot hang more memorable for a trophy then serviceable for any glorious use in the fullness of this prosperity he build the fort of Mountioy and fortify in many place of this dangerous country drive he with the rest of his follower into more remote place and the obscure corner of his Glan Cancones to which when he add the cut up of the corn which the cheerful soldier perform with their sword and take away their cow of which they have good store it be admirable to tell you what misery follow and the whole people endure for their swordman perish with sickness and famine the next year follow and the poor Calliots devour one another for mere hunger and show we the lamentable effect of a calamitous war and afflict country thus be tirone make the tennis-ball of fortune and abandon of Spain overprize greatness thus do he see the loss of his army and the misery of his people thus be he deject from the pride of his possession and repine to behold his adversary seat in his castle and town thus be he forsake of his friend kindred and complice and confine into the uncouth and remote place of his bog and wood thus be he afraid of betray even of those which lean on his bosom especial when the state bandit he and value his head at a thousand pound sterling and his body alive at two thousand pound and thus be he make the scorn of alteration and spectacle of human condition have nothing leave but a poor disconsolate life which it shall seem the law of nature assist he to maintain otherwise a roman spirit in spite of mischance have overcome distress with a glorious death but time have not full ripen as yet his fruit nor bring forward the harvest that shall gather in this disperse corn for this great torment rebel with strange demisnesse seek his peace at the hand of his long abuse sovereign and with new tear beg a new life nor be this submission ordinary after the custom of a soldier misfortune but as it be blot with the spot of a guilty conscience and interline with a strange manner of fearful penitency replete with execration against the cause of his mislead and terror of his offence not without tear from his eye drop of blood from his heart and curse from his very soul in demonstration of his remorse with protestation of better conformity with vow and dangerous oath for his loyalty with confident assurance for his obedience and with all the cunning that art mean circumstance and insinuation accustom in attract pardon this strange news be nothing acceptable to her majesty for she have rather have see his body on the ground headless than himself succourless and on his knee beg of pardon because my lord of Essex have promise as much and out of her own greatness she scorn to be so affront with a subject and naked rebel as she may well term he yea the council of her state have many time urge the facility of the matter and suggest against my lord of Essex by way of exaggerate his offence with this one slackness in the midst of his trouble so that now to take he to mercy after so much treasure disburse so many subject slay so untoward disturbance renew so wonderful report disperse so famous a action discredit and in a word the whole frame of her government abuse be a unsavoury demand and absolute contrary to her expectation especial when she have be wrought to the permission of her copper treasure in Ireland esteem the breakneck of the rebel design and a mere demonstration of our want in England but when the council urge the necessity of the time the situation of the country the fearfulness of further mischief the inconvenience of new trouble the threaten of the Spaniard the new intercession of the papist for another invasion the discontent of the irish themselves for all these triumph her princely disposition be overwrought to a reflect commiseration so that against the custom of incense majesty she admit of his prostitute homage and with some wonderment at the wretchedness of traitor and vicissitude of all thing she give way to his restitution with direction to the deputy to entertain he according so he make suit for the same and that it may appear to the world she be a absolute queen of her kingdom and however rebel may have ttayterous heart support by foreign coadiutement yet can no subject have powerful hand to pull the peace of her kingdom in piece or touch the skirt of her throne to disturb she in her establish mightiness when tirone understand that he must alter his compass and turn his sail to another coast he then employ his brother Arthur Mac baron and other of the best of his family and near of his affinity as agent of his peace and protection who diverse time repulse when remembrance lay open his former exorbitant action desist not yet from excuse of precedent occurrence and forcible intimation of the necessity of his present action nor leave they out the true manner of his now penitency and all their willingness to make he as it be a new creature and unite themselves in one combination for the acknowledge the superiority of England whereby at last that obdurate heart of our deputy which at first seem impenetrable be deflect and cast in a more gentle mould so that he appoint Mellifant by Tredagh where sir garret Moor be resident to be the school house of his conformity and place without other condition then submit to the queen mercy to admit of his repentance whither at the time appoint resort our noble lord deputy well attend for the better grace of his eminent greatness and the person he present thither come also tirone with some few lord of the north a spectacle of mischance and terror to the pride of man who suppose glory and ostentation the felicity of this world or presume on wealth and authority the very poison of our best endeavour nor be it with he as I remember the excuse poet in his distich touch offender cry out for as the case stand his offence and fault be the more heinous and condemnatory because his prince be a woman and one to who he have diverse time be behold for his life and in the doubtfulness of his first admission to his inheritance see the door of her treasury and magnificent bounty set open for he but to the purpose at the first entrance into the room even at the threshold of the door he prostrate himself grovel to the earth with such a deject countenance that the stander by be amaze and my lord deputy himself have much a do to remember the work in hand for whether the sight of so many captain and gentleman whether ashamed of himself when he see such a number of his own nation spectator of his wretchedness whether the consideration of his fortune that have thus embase he contrary to expectation whether the view of my lord to be his judge who once he repute to be at his mercy whether he repent this course of submission and degenerate beg of life when a noble death have be both honourable and the determiner of misery or whether man natural imperfection to be confound and alter with affliction depress his spirit I know not but it be one of the deplorabl sight that ever I see and to look upon such a person the author of so much trouble and so former glorious so deject will have wrought many change in the stout heart and do no doubt at this instant raise a certain commiseration in his great adversary after a while the deputy beckon he to come near believe it he arise but with such degree of humility as if misfortune have teach he cunning to grace his adversity for he pass not two step before he yield to a new prostitution which may well be call a grovel to the ground and so by divide ceremony fall on his knee begin a apology for some of his action but at every word confess in how many treason he have plunge himself offend God and her majesty how he have abuse her favour disturb her kingdom disobey her law wrong her subject abandon all civility and wrap himself in the very tarrier of destruction so that nothing remain but to fly to the refuge of her princely clemency which have so often restore both his life and honour here my lord deputy intercept his oratory with disclaim all circumlocution or defence of the course he have so disorderly undertake nay he will not hear a word of justify his dependency on Spain or admission of that enmity towards England withal apply some instruction worthy so great a commander name intermingle with reprehension full of authority and eloquence he admit he to stand near and after a hour or more give he leave to be cover use he with honourable respect both at his board and private conference and so within two day bring he as a trophy of his victory into Dublin with a full resolution to carry he into England and present he to her majesty but now be the sun of that glory eclipse and the divine providence think it meet to take she into his own protection for after she have live and reign to the admiration of all nation and fill the world with the fame of her virtue four and forty year and renown of life threescore and ten she be ordain for a better kingdom and the four and twenty day of march 1602. go to take possession of it my lord have notice long before of her decay which peradventure be a incitation the rather for the take in of tirone though he understand not so much so this great queen the wonder of time the admiration of her sex the help of all nation the princess of fame the mistress of honour the terror of Antichrist and the Commandrix of fortune leave her name everlasting and dignity unmatchable for believe it what foreign prince soever more than to admire she shall strive to imitate she will but wrong majesty and discover this imperfection that emulation be to virtue and when we can attain to the transcendency of another excellency we fall to vilipend the worth and malicious calumniation of the goodness and herein let England rejoice that the star of dignity and fame of those time be set under her climate by her death and in her life she treasure such jewel of estimation that the storehouse of other palace can not discover or show the like as for Rome and some defamatory invention of Spain the poison have return to their own prejudice like he which spit against the wind find his face besmear with the reflection for the better sort both mislike parson and other english priest in their degenerate invective and stop the mouth of inferior for once breathe amiss against her majesty which make i remember a worthy reprehension of count Mansfield towards captain Rowland York forbid he some looseness of speech against his queen and when he transgress further in undecency of faultfinding both with the government and life of her majesty in plain term he assure he that the custom of his table will admit of no irregular behaviour against prince nor can I forget duke Byron admiration who at his return into France plain divulge that the court of England spread abroad the colour of majesty indeed and all other be but a heap of confusion and disease mixture of unseemly familiarity but this be a digression for my own part therefore I will only bless her unimitable renown and end with the poet and so to our irish business again they which write of the nature of thing say plain which also experience confirm that as there be a sympathy and sweet agreement in many creature as beast plant and diverse of that sort each thrive the better by the other proximity and conversation so there be a kind of antipathy and eternal loathsomeness between creature and creature and many time such a abhorrency that the very sight and intermixture of thing breed death or other mischief thus be it apparent in diverse plant grow near the yew tree which either perish immediate or wither by degree without any prosperity they which be skilful in music say that the string of wolf and sheep make a discord and will never effect either diapason or harmony it be record that when Eteocles and Pollinices the son of Oedipus be burn after they have slay one another according to the solemnity of sacrifice in those day the very flame divide itself show that the hate last in death which can not be reconcile in life and if in any thing it ever appear it be and be most probable in the nature and condition of the irish and ourselves for though they have be many time reduce by conformable persuasion and as many time correct by powerful castigation yet nothing can detain they within the circle of obedience or fasten they to the dore-post of love and duty nor be this the error and enmity of the north or as you term it the wild irish only but the inficious disposition of the whole nation against who tirone himself in the behalf of our country have go in person as in the excursion of Munster lease Ophaly meth and Conach may appear yea at this instant for all the back of rebellion seem break and that this great prop of supportation tirone be take from they whereby they be past all hope of coadiutement either from he or Spain yet do the poison of their malice and despite burst out into boil and botch of deformity by rebellion against the king himself to welcome he the better even the first year of his establishment in a uncontrollable majesty all which do questionless arise from a inveterate hate and innated antipathy against we again whereas no venomous beast will live nor be breed in Ireland insomuch that beda report that in those day when the i will of man breed a controversy to which kingdom it do appertain whether England or Ireland the decide of the same consist in this to carry certain snake and toad into the country which if they agree in the same and do live will easy approve it english but if they die and miscarry then questionless by natural probability Ireland have the propriety wherein the divine providence be much glorify that will not altogether over-poyson a nation with noisome creature and beast consider the people be bad enough of themselves and have their very blood corrupt with the venom of malice envy disdain pride and revenge even against one another and against we if it be possible the very stone and house seem to swell with mislike and grow big again with the tumour of ambitious rebellion which more apparent appear in the treason of diverse town by name Waterford Corcke and Limricke who upon the false alarm of Sr. james gouths warrantise from England for the toleration of religion go as fresh to mass as if the pope himself have establish his superstitious canon in the same nor be this do out of zeal or indirect devotion according to the simplicity of diverse who be willing to maintain the catholic cause but with fury rage and military direction these strong town entertain a presumption of fortify themselves against the power of England whereupon my lord deputy be compel to leave tirone to himself with a kind of confidence of his loyalty and politic direction for the supervise of his action and in person go forward to the suppress these insolence unfold again to his great grief and unquietness the wind up colour of defiance which he have suppose have be lay aside for ever so that whole summer be spend in unheard of hurly-burly and his return into England procrastinate for a time nor be the business so soon determine or the intricateness of this disturbance so easy untie as many imagine for Waterford shut the gate stand upon their guard and deny he entrance with his army until exasperate with the displeasure he read they such a lesson of martial discipline that they well understand a patard can blow open their gate a mine or battery overthrow their wall and such a commander will not be dally withal when he determine indeed to whip their treason with a imperious authority and so he proceed according pull this high-looking head of innovation on her knee depress the glory of their mayor and government forfeit their liberty to the state and establish Sr. Richard monson in the full authority of the city who most judicious for the time commit the key of the gate to the care and valour of captain Meres at Corcke they begin more rough demolish the new fort which be a building turn their ordnance against the castle of shandon which they shoot through when my lady Carey be in it muster their townsman to the number of two thousand one or other with who they resolve to man their wall and defend their port and proceed with a savage immanity against diverse even to the shed of blood that seem to intercept or be angry with their jollity and for all they have hear how Waterford be serve yet they dare say that Corcke be a strong town better man and so well fortify that they know my lord deputy preparation be not able to surprise they which hasten his speediness and increase his anger so that they find their abuse presumption quick overmastre and beside those which be slay in the encounter my lord hang diverse and arraign both the mayor and recorder upon high treason set upright again both shandon and the new fort who at either end of the town overlook the same and can by this time batter their house about their ear if they do but repine or whisper against they from hence he march to Limricke but they grow wise by other man harm according to that good council of welcome he that will have welcome himself and submit to such direction as he enforce against they not without imprison certain priest and factious citizen who he detain in prison as he have do in the other place from hence he determine to visit Galloway but understand of their conformity he put it in the account of true subject and repute she as a daughter of fair condition and good behaviour notwithstanding he come to athlone and wipe away all aspersion of rebellion as he go he leave they with fair face than they accustom to have to look more cheerful on his deputy Sr. George Cary the treasurer at war who enjoy both place do proceed judicious in the civil administration as little trouble with any remarkable innovation the rest of the time of his commorance in the country the next year our deputy prepare for England as make one of his majesty privy council lord lieutenant of Ireland and within a while create the earl of Devonshire with some donation of land and contribution of pension to the eternal honour of such a majesty that will not let virtue shed a tear for sorrow that she be unrespected and comfort of all the monarchy that be the better animate to generous performance when they see the prince will regard they thus be tirone carry into England as the trophy of his former endeavour and victory but what a terrible reckon the account of his treason and undutiful proceed sum together every man can tell which overlook the same for the people hate as he pass through Wales and other place be so inflame against he that the woman presume to throw dirt and stone at he and the spread tree which cover he have much ado to overshadow and secure he from the malice and threat of such as rail upon he yet with some ado have he safe conduct to the court and our worthy king look on he with the eye of a noble commiseration quick welcome he with cheerfulness and as quick by the favour of Cyrus return he as the jew to build up the wall of break and desolate jerusalem so he to reintegrate his estate repair his castle and town and settle himself in his inheritance as lieutenant of the country under the king and to govern the same after the manner of England by this time be Sr. Arthur chichester lord deputy who watch these part of the north more narrow than any other before he first because of his long experience and residence among they as be governor of and a laborious searcher of Logh Con with all the territory adjacent second in regard of the way open to the flourish of peace when the lord of the north see such a unity and consent of goodness by remission three in regard of his private love in these part to which be unite a kind of fear and observation of his virtue he have so demean himself before and continue ever since last of all by reason of straight direction from England to have the shire divide with their orderly officer of lieutenant and justice of peace even among the mere irish who never hear of such name and government before to send out judge of assize who absolute authority be for the time supereminent above all other and to punish malefactor after our law and fashion of England even to the terror of the great who vilipend the same or dare oppose against the inhibition to the contrary which when tirone perceive must be do indeed he live more discontent then ever and freight as it be with old stowage of malice and envy study every hour how to cast off this intolerable yoke of obedience and not to suffer as he term it another to sit paramount in the tribunal of his judicature so that according to our first of Cyrus return the jew to jerusalem you shall see how he keep correspondency in the same the jew surfeit of ease forget their captivity and return to lick up the filth that their excess have vomit yea so exasperate the displeasure of their great and good God that at last he forsake they indeed and stretch the strong arm of Vespasian and Titus to unplume their lay feather and throw they forsake over the world like disperse vagabond tirone return home as you hear live at ease and pleasure surfeit of the same entertain his priest hearken to his bard and rhymer be seduce to mislike this new government deny the judge of assize entrance into his country contest with the deputy about the same although he ever acknowledge his worth and confess that Sr. Arthur chichester have unite many virtue to a soldier name second the earl of Terconnel in his repine and allow of Sr. Caher odohordies contention malign our forwardness and success when he see he lie bleed on the ground and very suppose that the burn of the dery with the come forward of Odonnell to forage the country will have make another gordian to trouble all the country again to untie the knot but as God will have it there be another Alexander to fulfil the prophecy or Oedipus to dissolve the riddle who with a sword in his hand can cut it in piece so that these new rebel be discomfit and such a blast of displeasure be blow against Dungannon as the north-east wind that strike the four corner of job elder son house and quite overthrow it to the destruction of the people within for when my lord deputy see no other remedy but that Tamberlaines black flag must needs be set up the white and the red quite refuse he haste with fire and sword into the north and not only tertify this rebellious lord with all his complice but compel they to abandon their castle house and inheritance take absolute possession for his new master the king of great Britain and incorporate they to the crown so firm and perpetual that no fine and recovery of their rebellious power shall or can disannul the contract or frustrate the deed for England present seize on the same and like a true lord and powerful commander place better tenant and divide the country into several man hand yea enfeoff the city of London with such a right that I be persuade all the irish in the world or irish coadjutor will never be able to wrest it out of their hand tirone be thus make the spectacle of misery by the incitement of certain priest fly into Terconnell and contrive with that earl to forsake their country and repair to Rome where they may be sure to be shroud under the angel wing of the castle St. Angelo and bless with the holy father entertainment from the affront of all disturbance which according with all conveniency they can they put in practice gather together what treasure the country afford and so with his wife and child terconnell wife and young son and some fifty person or attendant they ship themselves and find sufficient friend and mean to escape thus like exile forsake disperse and abandon full of horror of a guilty conscience vex in soul by strange excruciation torment with fear of be betray at home abash at the shame of be entertain abroad and affright with the disaster of their lamentable dejection they be at length compulse to hide themselves among the rot reed of Egypt even the pope and his consistory of cardinal as in their former determination where how his affliction increase and with what vexation of spirit he eat the repine bran of other man corn that may have feed on the fine flower of his own thresh I believe most traveller know but be assure some tremble to behold the alteration so that for myself well acquaint with all his entertainment abroad and misfortune at home as know he in Ireland and meet he in Italy I may lawful conclude
